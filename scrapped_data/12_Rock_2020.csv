You would think I'd of realised... but I didn't for quite some time
Started wetting my eyes - cause I'm soft in that department
Right then I realised... you're the love of my life
The moment that you took my hand
was the best thing that ever happened
The moment that we started a band
was the best thing that ever happened
And I wish that we could do it again
it was the best thing that ever happened to me
               It was the best thing that ever happened to me
               It was the best thing that ever happened
I took a zut outside - in my coat's secret compartment
I hear a song and start to cry... pretend it's smoke that's in my eye
I don't know why I'm surprised - cause we all shared one apartment
Man, they were the golden times... they were the best of my life
The moment that you took my hand
was the best thing that ever happened
The moment that we started a band
was the best thing that ever happened
The first time we went to Japan
was the best thing that ever happened
And I wish that we could do it again
you guys are the best thing that ever happened to me
               You guys are the best thing that ever happened to me
               You guys are the best thing that ever happened
               You guys are the best thing that ever happened to me

If I always do what I'm told
I'll be bitter at 50 years old
I wasted my youth
Wasted my time
Wasted my worry on the little things
If you always just laugh it off
I won't be opening up
We kissed on the bed
It messed with my head
Does that mean nothing to you?

When I'm wearing nothing but blame
Not easy, 'cause when I close my eyes
I just think of touching you
This can't be easy on his side
Laying there motionless each night
A head full of heat, skin, sweat, sin
Tangled up feet and now clutching at sheets thinking

this sentence ending with

Is it courageous or escapist
to leave the quarantine when you’re contagious?
It may just be a cold,
and besides I don’t wanna get old yeah
 I drank myself to death
to be the afterlife of the party
When the afterparty came,
I was rolling in my grave
And I'd rather be normal. Yes, so normal
I suggest that we keep this informal
‘Cause a normal human being wouldn't need
To pretend to be normal, to be normal
Well I guess that's the least that I owe ya!
To be normal in a way I couldn’t be, yeah yeah
C’mon, c’mon, and love me normally
  Now this is the part of the song
where I like to talk to my audience
  I like to tell 'em there's something I want
from you hep cats tonight.
I want you to look to your left,
look to your right,
nine o'clock, rock around the clock tonight
And I want you to find those points of no return,
those singularities, those burning rings of fire
in the beautiful pupils and the beautiful eyes
of the beautiful boy, girl, neither, both,
or in-between that you brought with you tonight.
And I want you to tell 'em how you really feel.
I want you to love the way they so seamlessly,
like a dream for me,
so beautifully, oh so dutifully
 jam that square peg in the
round hole in their hearts!
I want you to tell 'em that you love the way
that they don't stick out like sore middle fingers
That they crawl their way up the side of the bell curve,
stick their flag in the peak,
and slide their way back down!
I want you to tell them that you love the way
that they're not maladaptive,
 not malignant or maleficent,
 but rather that you love them
exactly the way that everybody else is!
 I was nothing before
so I couldn’t have asked to be born.
 I'll be nothing again,
so what am I between now and then?
 Is there nothing to fear?
Cause shit's getting weird!
So to God who made this man,
you better have one hell of a plan!
And I'd rather be normal. Yes, so normal
I suggest that we keep this informal
Cause a normal human being wouldn't need, no,
To pretend to be normal, to be normal
Well I guess that's the least that I owe ya!
To be normal in a way that I could never be, yeah
C’mon, c’mon, yeah, I said c’mon, yeah.
C’mon, c’mon, yeah, I said c’mon, yeah!
C’mon, c’mon, and love me normally!
Woah, yeah yeah, woah yeah

Forse era meglio un buco in vena
Ho sempre fatto pena
Odio la riviera
La sua faccia mentre guida
Tu che fai la scema
E pensi che lui ti completa
Io stanotte vado a letto senza cena
E te ne vai al mare
E poi mi mangi il cuore
Non è sangue, ma ripieno all’amarena
Notte di luna piena
Vampiri alla mia schiena
Te ne vai al mare
E poi mi mangi il cuore
Non è sangue, ma ripieno all’amarena
Notte di luna piena
Vampiri alla mia schiena
A volte l’amore ti lascia un po’ di segni sulla faccia
Hai messo il rossetto, sembrava come sangue sulle labbra
E tutti questi sassi nelle scarpe sono diventati sabbia
Perché sto in giro a cercarti da una notte intera
Odio la riviera
La sua giacca e la camicia
Tu che fai la scema
E pensi che lui ti completa
Io stanotte vado a letto senza cena

Sigarette come caramelle
Una dietro l’altra
Prima ti cercavo, adesso ti evito
Tornerò da solo come sempre

Why would you pay for this apartment you don't belong in?
You take this shit from all your bosses and all your boyfriends
I guess I get surprised when you let it slide
  Don't crash, don't text, don't renew your tags
No sex, no sleep, just that job
I bet you miss what you had
You can't get no sleep at night
Do you ever wonder why everyone is out to get you every day
Or do you question anything?
  How many warnin' signs 'til it hits you, darling?
  You fall out of touch sometimes
But your history calls you back to it again
  Too many factors to be sure
  So many reasons to think twice

Maybe we can hit the 405
Hypnotized by the lights
Man, this must be the life

44,Golden G String,Miley Cyrus,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/miley-cyrus/golden-g-string-chords-3441548," I woke up in Montecito
I was thinkin' about my life
And the questions made more questions
Starin' out into the night
Yes, I've worn the golden g-string
Put my hand into hellfire
I did it all to make you love me and to feel alive
Oh, that's just the world that we're livin' in
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playin' gin
You dare to call me crazy, have you looked around this place?
I should walk away
Oh, I should walk away
But I think I'll stay
There are layers to this body
Primal sex and primal shame
They told me I should cover it
So I went the other way
I was tryin' to own my power
Still I'm tryin' to work it out
And at least it gives the paper somethin' they can write about
Oh, that's just the world that we're livin' in
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playin' gin
You dare to call me crazy, have you looked around this place?
I should walk away
Oh, I should walk away
But I think I'll stay
So the mad man's in the big chair
And his heart's an iron vault
He says ""If you can't make ends meet, honey, it must be your fault""
We all focus on the winners
And get blinded by their shine
Maybe caring for each other's just too 1969
Oh, that's just the world that we're livin' in
The old boys hold all the cards and they ain't playin' gin
You dare to call me crazy, have you looked around this place?
I should walk away
Oh, I should walk away
But I think I'll stay
And I think I'll stay, yeah
I have too much to lose
So I think I'll stay
I can't walk away

Feels like forever since I saw you
I'm forgetting how you felt now
I've never had this much time on my hands
  Move the kitchen table out to the lawn
Roll up the rug, the stereo's on
All I can imagine is being in your arms
I don't need anything fancy
I just need me and you slow dancing
Hell's bending keeping me captive
Heaven's here, it’s right where you're standing
Slow dancing
Ooh-ooh,   ooh-ooh
I've got my reasons to complain
And they're tangled in red, white, and blue
The battle outside is blazing

There's people climbing up the wall 'cause it's a packed house
""Who are you? What's your name?"" I ask

And we both don't know this band

Yeah, the cigarettes and the burnin'  whiskey
I can taste on my tongue when you kiss me
Down your drink faster than me    you ask if you can see
my bedroom and the place that I grew up
My life goals and the times that I threw up
Said you're down to take a ride

I feel lost sitting alone in my room
Get your pride out of my face
You tell me it will be okay
The words that you say don't make you any more of a man
Miss seeing things being done with your hands
Do you believe in God or anything at all?
What morals do you stand by?
Have your standards started to fall?
Do you believe in God?
What makes you build yourself so high?
Can't see you anymore
It's almost like the features of your face are indescribable
Eat the shit that you've made
Go sit in that grave, the one that you've dug for yourself
I don't care, your body isn't mine
You're no longer mine

Have your standards started to fall?

Everything looks the same
The blurry green helps me meditate
When everything’s always changing

Dead or alive, dead or alive

I know I got you (I know I got you)
And you know you got me
We got everything we need

To see whеre we used to hang
It’s worn down likе the rest of us

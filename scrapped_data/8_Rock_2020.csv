Everyone leaves eventually, darling, don't be afraid
No, really, don't worry, won't you scurry now?
While your life's in pieces and love is but a fleeting friend
Don't pretend that you care either
As one of many broken hearts to mend
I see you and love just doesn't care for you

A little bit of love goes a pretty long way
All your wounds are healing fine

Now the winter frost is gone
Now is our chance to live the life we want

Some show it, some hide it
But thеre's a battle we're all fighting

Walking down the sunny side of the street
Shadows creeping at your back
You can forget 'em like an amnesiac

Goes a pretty long way
Love is really like a wonder drug
Let's medicate
And say goodbye to the drama
It's a beeline to nirvana

 You kids and your jokes
 Asking where we got our jeans and where the hell we found our coats
 'Cause dirty streets these days are graced by Nikes of black and green
 And headstrong boys in chinos barely grasp what that could mean
And they lie, the men that wrung us dry
The boys who poked your eye
The common fool, the walk to school for you and I
But we've been held back for after-school meetings
They've got it in for me

The thing is, these out-of-touch scrounging rich kids
Are living here for free

And I never see you again
So please save all your questions for the end
And maybe I'll be brave enough by then
Don't wanna say something wrong
Don't wanna be weird
But if you're still in love with her
I think that I'll leave it there
And I won't ever tell you this
Oh, cause to tell you is too scary
So I'll just say something else
Like how was fall semester?
And what was that song about?
I'll try to hide the way I feel
But I'll just wanna shout
What do I have to lose right now?
I wanna eat pancakes for dinner
I wanna get stuck in your head
I wanna watch a T.V. show together
And when we're under the weather we can watch it in bed
I wanna go out on the weekends
I wanna dress up just to get undressed
I think that I should probably tell you this
In case there is an accident
And I never see you again
So please save all your questions for the end
And maybe I'll be brave enough by then
Well, maybe I won't ever say what's in my head
No, I won't have to say anything
You'll say it instead

And scratch your cheek real slow
  Draw blood, taste water
  And drink it till there's no more
   Throw a punch watch it sail through the air
  Keep talking but there's nobody there
  Can't remember anything that you say
  Slit your throat and die and wake up the next day
I wanna scream
I wanna run
I'd die at 22 to feel alive at 21
It's lukewarm
And stale bread
I wanna put a magic bullet in my head
It's lukewarm
It's stale bread
I wanna get my heavy bones out of bed
  I couldn't pass the Turing test if I
  Had the answer sheet
  I wanna leave everyone who loves me
'Cause I'm so bland and they're so sweet
The news used to make me cry every time
I'd rather cry than cum tonight
  Can't even give a fuck in my dreams
Oh, what I wouldn't give to care enough to scream
I wanna scream
I wanna run
I'd die at 22 to feel alive at 21
It's lukewarm
And stale bread
I wanna put a magic bullet in my head
I wanna put a magic bullet in my bed
Snort coke
Get fucked
Go to church and pray to live a life that doesn't suck
Read books
And get laid
And maybe God will let me fucking die one day

 They float above the sand, they're slowly sinking in

Whistling my name
Open up a beer
And you say get over here
And play a video game

Watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown
I say you the bestest
Lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite perfume on
Go play a video game
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby now you do
Singing in the old bars
Swinging with the old stars
Living for the fame
Kissing in the blue dark
Playing pool and wild darts
Video games
He holds me in his big arms
Drunk and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of
Watching all our friends fall
In and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playing video games

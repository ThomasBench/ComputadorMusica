And you're back out on the street,
And you're tryin' to remember.
How do you start it over?
You don't know if you can.
You don't care much for a stranger's touch,
But you can't hold your man.
You never thought you'd be alone
This far down the line
And I know what's been on your mind
You're afraid it's all been wasted time.
The autumn leaves have got you thinking
About the first time that you fell
You didn't love the boy too much, no, no
You just loved the boy too well, farewell.
So you live from day to day,
And you dream about tomorrow, oh,
And the hours go by like minutes
And the shadows come to stay
So you take a little something 
To make them go away.
And I could have done so many things, baby
If I could only stop my mind
From wondrin' what I left behind
And from worrying 'bout this wasted time.
Ooh, another love has come and gone
Ooh, and the years keep rushing on
I remember what you told 
me before you went out on your own:
""Sometimes to keep it together,
You gotta leave it alone.""
So you can get on with your search, baby,
And I can get on with mine
And maybe someday we will find, that it
Wasn't really wasted time.

Oh ooooh,
Oh ooooh.

And if the wind is right you can sail away and find tranquility

And if the wind is right you can find the joy of innocence again
Oh, the canvas can do miracles, just you wait and see

Sailing takes me away to where I've always heard it could be
Just a dream and the wind to carry me
And soon I will be free

All caught up in the reverie, every word is a symphony

 Caught in a land-slide; no es-cape from re-ali-ty.
 Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see.
 I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, because I'm;
 Easy come, easy go, little high, little low.
 Any way the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me... to me.
 Mama, just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead.
 Mama, life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all a-way.
 Mama, ooh-ooh, didn't mean to make you cry.
If I'm not back again, this time to-morrow;
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters.
 Too late; my time has come,
Sent shivers down my spine, body's achin' all the time.
 Goodbye everybody; I've got to go.
Gotta leave you all be-hind and face the truth.
 Mama, ooh-ooh, I don't want to die.
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
 I see a little silho-uetto of a man.
 Scar-mouche, Scar-mouche, will you do the Fan-dan-go?
 Thunder bolts and lightening; very, very frightening me.
 Galileo, (Galileo), Galileo, (Galileo Figaro). Mangnifico-oh-oh-oh....
 I'm just a poor boy, no-body loves me.
 (He's just a poor boy, from a poor fami-ly;
 Spare him his life from this monstrosi-ty).

 Oh mama-mia, mama-mia, mama-mi-a let  me go!
Be-elze-bub, has a Devil put a-side for me, for me, for me...
 So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
 So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
 Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby.
 Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here.

 Nothing really matters, nothing really matters, to me.

And maybe you can cry all night

I wish you wouldn't make me leave here
I poured it on and I poured it out
I tried to show you just how much I care

You'll never drill for oil on a city street

She never loved me back
Ooh I know
Well I remember how she left me on a stormy night
Oh, She kissed me and got out of our bed

knew she'd have to come up soon for air.

We can discover the wonders of nature
rolling in the bushes down by the riverside.
She's got everything delightful, she's got everything I need,
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double, pays my ticket when I speed
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
she can wade in a drop of dew,
She don't come and I don't follow
waits backstage while I sing to you.
Well, she can dance a Cajun rhythm
jump like a willys in four wheel drive.
She's a summer love for spring, fall and winter
She can make happy any man alive.
Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell, caught up in sunlight
come on out singing I'll walk you in the sunshine
She's got everything delightful, she's got everything I need,
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
lazing in the sunshine yes indeed.
Sometimes when the cuckoo's cryin'
when the moon is half way down,
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander around, I wander 'round.
Sunshine, daydream, walking in the tall trees
going where the wind goes blooming like a red rose
breathing more freely, Ride our singin', I'll walk you in the morning sunshine

The elastic retreat rings the close of play
as the last wave uncovers  the newfangled way.

and your suntan does rapidly peel..
and your wise men don't know how it feels...

With nightmares and with dreams,
Will no one lay the laurel wreath
When silence drowns the screams.
Confusion will be my epitaph.

The seeds of time were sown,
And watered by the deeds of those

Knowledge is a deadly friend

On that California coast
He was a Midwestern boy on his own
She looked at him with those soft eyes
So innocent and blue
He knew right then he was too far from home
    He was too far from home
She took his hand and she led him along that golden beach
They watched the waves tumble over the sand
They drove for miles and miles
Up those twisting turning roads
Higher and higher and higher they climbed
And those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
She was looking so right
In her diamonds and frills
Oh those big city nights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
She had all of her skills
He'd headed west cause he felt that a change would do him good
See some old friends, good for the soul
She had been born with a face
That would let her get her way
He saw that face and he lost all control
    He had lost all control
Night after night, Day after day It went on and on
Then came that morning he woke up alone
He spent all night staring down at the lights on LA
Wondering if he could ever go home
And those Hollywood nights
In those Hollywood hills
She was looking so right
It was giving him chills
In those big city nights
In those high rolling hills
Above all the lights
With a passion that kills
And those Hollywood nights

If I were a good man, I'd understand the spaces between friends.
If I were alone, I would cry.
And if I were with you, I'd be home and dry.
And if I go insane, will you still let me join in with the game?
If I were a swan, I'd be gone.
If I were a train, I'd be late again.
If I were a good man, I'd talk with you more often than I do.

47,One Of These Nights (ver 2),Eagles,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/eagles/one-of-these-nights-chords-1051015,"One of these nights, one of these crazy old nights  
we're gonna find out, pretty mama, what turns on your lights
The full moon is calling, the fever is high
and the wicked wind whispers and moans,
you got your demons, you got your desires,
well, I got a few of my own.
Ooh, someone to be kind to in between the darkness and light.
Ooh, coming right behind you, swear I'm gonna find you 
One of these Nights.
One of these dreams, one of these lost and lonely dreams
we are gonna find a girl, one that really screams
I've been searchin' for the daughter of the devil himself
I've been searchin' for an angel in white.
I've been waitin' for a woman who's a little of both
and I can feel her but she's nowhere in sight.
Ooh, loneliness will bind you in between the wrong and the right
Ooh, coming right behind you, swear I'm gonna find you
One of these Nights....
One of these nights 
In between the dark and the light 
Coming right behind you 
Swear I'm gonna find you 
Get 'ya baby one of these nights 
One of these nights   ooh ooh ooh
One of these nights 
I can feel it 
I can feel it 
One of these nights 
Coming right behind you 
One of these nights...

           Tell me, how long you gonna stay here Joe?
Some people say this town don't look good in snow.
You don't care, I know.
Ventura highway in the sunshine
Where the days are longer, the nights are stronger than moonshine
You gotta go, I know
'Cause the free wind is blowin' through your hair
And the days surround your daylight there
Seasons crying no despair
Alligator lizards in the air
In the air
                Wishin' on a fallin' star, waitin' for the early train
                Sorry son, But I been hit by Purple rain
                Aw, c'mon Joe, You can always change your name
                Thanks a lot son, just the same.

49,Ride Like The Wind,Christopher Cross,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/christopher-cross/ride-like-the-wind-chords-492435,"It is the night. My body's weak 
I'm on the run. No time for sleep 
I've got to ride, Ride like the wind to be free again 
And I got such a long way to go 
To make it to the border of Mexico. 
So I'll ride...like the wind 
Ride like the wind.       
I was born the son of a lawless man. 
Always spoke my mind with a gun in my hand. 
Lived nine lives gunned down ten. 
Gonna ride like the wind. 
And I got such a long way to go 
To make it to the border of Mexico. 
So I'll ride...like the wind 
Ride like the wind.                          
Accused and tried and told to hang 
I was no where in sight when the church bells rang. 
Never was the kind to do as I was told. 
Gonna ride like the wind before I get old. 
It is the night. My body's weak 
I'm on the run. No time for sleep 
I've got to ride, Ride like the wind to be free again 
And I got such a long way to go 
To make it to the border of Mexico. 
So I'll ride...like the wind 
Ride like the wind. 
And I got such a long way to go

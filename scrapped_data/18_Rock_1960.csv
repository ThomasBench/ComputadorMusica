I'm goin' up the country, baby don't you wanna go?
I'm goin' up the country, baby don't you wanna go?
I'm goin' to some place where I've never been before.
I'm goin', I'm goin' where the water tastes like wine.
Well, I'm goin' where the water tastes like wine.
You can jump in the water and stay drunk all the time.
I'm gonna leave this city, got to get away.
I'm gonna leave this city, got to get away.
All this fussin' and fightin' man you know I sure can't stay.
Now Baby, packin' up the truck you know I got to leave today,
just exacly where I'm goin' I can not say but, we might even leave
the USA
It a brand-new game and I don't wanna play.
No use of you runnin' or screamin' and cryin'.
But you got a home man, long as I got mine.
Gotta get goin' gotta get goin', gotta get goin' gotta get goin'
Gotta get goin'. Well I'm goin', Well I'm goin'.. One More.

Crazy Man Michael was walking
He met with a raven with eyes black as coals
And shortly they fell a talking
Your future, your future I will tell to you
Your future you often have asked me
Your true love will die by your own right hand
And Crazy Man Michael will cursed be
Michael he ranted and Michael he raved
And beat the 4 winds with his fists-o
He laughed and he cried he shouted and he swore
For his mad mind had trapped him with a curse-o
You speak with and evil, you speak with a hate
You speak for the devil that haunts me
For is she not the fairest in all the broad land
Your sorcerer's words are to tempt me.
He took out his dagger of fire and of steel
And struck down the raven through the heart-o
The bird fluttered long and the sky it did spin
And the cold earth did wonder and stare-o
Oh where is the raven that I struck down dead
That here did lie on the ground-o
I see my true love with a wound so red
And her lover's heart it did pound-o
Crazy Man Michael he wanders of course
And talks to the night and the day-o
And his eyes they are sane and his speech it is clear
And he longs to be far away-o
Michael he whistles the simplest of tunes
And asks the wild rose their pardon
For his true love is flown into every flower grown
And he must be keeper of the garden

Autumn leaves must fall
But don't you know that it hurts me so

No no no no
And when the rain
Beats against my window pane

I'm the Cream of the Great Utopia Dream
And you're the gleam in the depths of your banker's spleen
I'm a phallus in pigtails
And there's blood on my nose
And my tissue is rotting
Where the rats chew my bones
And my eye sockets empty
See nothing but pain

About twelve times a day
So now, you could spend the morning walking with me, quite amazed
As I'm Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed
I got eyes in my backside
That see electric tomatoes
On credit card rye bread
There are children in washrooms
Holding hands with a queen
And my heads full of murders
Where only killers scream
So now you could spend the morning talking with me quite amazed
And I'm raving mad and Somewhat Slightly Dazed

To the porcelain bowl
And you're sick from your ears
To the red parquet floor
And the Braque on the wall
Slides down your front
And eats through your belly

Pour un oui pour un non
L´amour n´est pas que dans les chansons
Poupée de cire poupée de son
Mes disques sont un miroir
Dans lequel chacun peut me voir
Je suis partout à la fois
Brisée en mille éclats de voix
Seule parfois je soupire
Je me dis à quoi bon
Chanter ainsi l´amour sans raison
Sans rien connaître des garçons
Je n´suis qu´une poupée de cire
Qu´une poupée de son
Sous le soleil de mes cheveux blonds
Poupée de cire poupée de son
Mais un jour je vivrai mes chansons
Poupée de cire poupée de son
Sans craindre la chaleur des garçons
Poupée de cire poupée de son.

Try and understand your man the best you can.

Get yourself a bride

I nearly wrote my will
But I changed my mind for the better, 
I'm at the still, had my fill and I'm fit to kill

Harvest moon shining down from the sky, 
a weary sign for all
I'm gonna leave this one horse town, 
had to stall till the fall, now I'm gonna crawl
Across the great divide
Now molly dear, don't ya shed a tear
Your time will surely come, 
you'll feed your man chicken every Sunday 
Now tell me, hon, whatcha done with the gun?
Across the great divide,

Get yourself a bride, 
and bring your children down to the river side.

0,Keinen Zentimeter (ver 5),Clueso,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/clueso/keinen-zentimeter-chords-1705307,"Und wir laufen, um uns zu begegnen
Die Augen zu vom reden
Frei und noch entspannt
Und wir glauben, getauft auf noch warmen Wegen
Die Nacht wirkt überlegen
Frei und doch gespannt
Frei und noch gespannt
Ich will keinen Zentimeter mehr zwischen uns
Ein Fleck ohne Kontur
Ich will einen Anfang mit mehr Tiefe, mit mehr Hintergrund
Ein Ende ohne Zensur
Und wir liegen, nicht weit von unserm Leben
Ich kann in deinen Augen lesen
Frei und noch entspannt
Und wir lieben, dem hellen Tag entgegen
Offen und verlegen
Frei und doch gespannt
So frei und noch entspannt
Ich will keinen Zentimeter mehr zwischen uns
Ein Fleck ohne Kontur
Ich will einen Anfang mit mehr Tiefe, mit mehr Hintergrund
Ein Ende ohne Zensur
Ich würd' gern mit dir mehr,
mit dir mehr unternehmen
Ich will keinen Zentimeter mehr zwischen uns
Ein Fleck ohne Kontur
Ich will einen Anfang mit mehr Tiefe, mit mehr Hintergrund
Ein Ende ohne Zensur

Down the corner of my street 
Every night there the headlights are glowing 
Theres a cold war coming, 
On the radio I heard
Baby it's a violent world 
Oh love don't let me go 
Won't you take me where the streetlights glow 
I could hear it coming 
I could hear the sirens sound 
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Time came a-creepin' 
Oh and time's a loaded gun
Every road is a ray of light 
It goes o-o-o-on
Time only can lead you on
Still it's such a beautiful night 
Oh love don't let me go 
Won't you take me where the streetlights glow 
I could hear it coming 
Like a serenade of sound 
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Gravity release me,
And dont ever hold me down 
Now my feet won't touch the ground

When you get what you want, but not what you need

Stuck in reverse.

3,The Remedy I Wont Worry (ver 3),Jason Mraz,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jason-mraz/the-remedy-i-wont-worry-chords-667626,"I saw fireworks from the freeway
And behind closed eyes I cannot make them go away
Cause you were born on the fourth of july, freedom ring 
Well something on the surface it stinks
I said something on the surface, well it kind of makes me nervous
Who says that you deserve this and what kind of god would serve this?
We will cure this dirty old disease
Well if you've got the poison I've got the remedy
The remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I say the comedy is that its serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
Well it all amounts to nothing in the end.
I--- I wont worry my life away. Hey, oh oh.
I--- I wont worry my life away. Hey, oh oh.
I heard two men talking on the radio
In a cross fire kind of new reality show
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack 
They were counting down the days to stab the brother in the
Be right back after this, the unavoidable kiss, 
Where the minty fresh death breath is sure to outlast
This catastrophy, dance with me
Because if you've got the poison, I've got the remedy 
The remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I say the comedy is that its serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
Well it all amounts to nothing in the end.
I--- I wont worry my life away. Hey, oh oh.
I--- I wont worry my life away. Hey, oh oh.
 When I fall in love I take my time
 There's no need to hurry when I'm making up my mind
 You can turn off the sun but I'm still gonna shine and I'll tell you why
I--- I wont worry my life away. Hey, oh oh.

4,If I Ever Feel Better,Phoenix,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/phoenix/if-i-ever-feel-better-chords-2018241,"They say an end can be a start 
Feel like I've been buried yet I'm still alive 
It's like a bad day that never ends 
I feel the chaos around me 
A thing I don't try to deny 
I'd better learn to accept that 
There are things in my life that I can't control
They say love ain't nothing but a sore 
I don't even know what love is 
Too many tears have had to fall 
Don't you know I'm so tired of it all 
I have known terror dizzy spells 
Finding out the secrets words won't tell 
Whatever it is it can't be named 
There's a part of my world that's in the way
You know I don't want to be clever 
To be brilliant or superior 
True like ice, true like fire 
Now I know that a breeze can blow me away 
Now I know there's much more dignity 
In defeat than in the brightest victory 
I'm losing my balance on the tight rope 
Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please
If I ever feel better 
Remind me to spend some good time with you 
You can give me your number 
When it's all over I'll let you know
Hang on to the good days
I can lean on my friends 
They help me going through hard times 
But I'm feeding the enemy 
I'm in league with the foe 
Blame me for what's happening 
I can try, I can try, I can try
No one knows the hard times I went through 
If happiness came I miss the call 
The stormy days ain't over 
I've tried and lost know I think that I pay the cost 
Now I've watched all my castles fall 
They were made of dust, after all 
Someday all this mess will make me laugh  
I can wait, I can wait, I can wait 
If I ever feel better 
Remind me to spend some good time with you 
You can give me your number 
When it's all over I'll let you know
If I ever feel better 
Remind me to spend some good time with you 
You can give me your number 
When it's all over I'll let you know
It's like somebody took my place 
I ain't even playing my own game 
The rules have changed well I didn't know 
There are things in my life that I can't control
I feel the chaos around me 
A thing I don't try to deny 
I'd better learn to accept that 
There's a part of my life that will go away
Dark is the night, cold is the ground 
In the circular solitude of my heart 
As one who strives a hill to climb 
I am sure I'll come through I don't know how 
They say an end can be a start
Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive
I'm losing my balance on the tight rope 
Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please

You were digging plants, I dug you, beg your pardon
I took a photograph of you in the herbaceous border
It broke the heart of men and flowers and girls and trees
Another rainy day, we’re trapped inside with a train set
Chocolate on the boil, steamy windows when we met
You’ve got the attic window looking out on the cathedral
And on a Sunday evening bells ring out in the dusk
Another day in June, we’ll pick eleven for football
We’re playing for our lives the referee gives us fuck all
I saw you in the corner of my eye on the sidelines
Your dark mascara bids me to historical deeds
Everybody’s gone you picked me up for a long drive
We take the tourist route the nights are light until midnight
We took the evening ferry over to the peninsula
We found the avenue of trees went up to the hill
That crazy avenue of trees, I’m living there still
There’s something in my eye a little midge so beguiling
Sacrificed his life to bring us both eye to eye
I heard the Eskimos remove obstructions with tongues, dear
You missed my eye, I wonder why, I didn’t complain
You missed my eye, I wonder why, please do it again
The lovin is a mess what happened to all of the feeling?
I thought it was for real; babies, rings and fools kneeling
And words of pledging trust and lifetimes stretching forever
So what went wrong? It was a lie, it crumbled apart
Ghost figures of past, present, future haunting the heart

Chosen specially for you and I
Who will live inside
The mountaineers gathered timber, piled high
In which to take along
Travelling many miles, knowing they'd get here
When they got here, all exhausted
On the roof leaks, they got started
And now when the rain comes we can be thankful
Ooh aaah ooh
When the mountaineers saw that everything fit
They were glad and so they took off
Thought we were due for 
A change or two around this place
When they get back they're all mixed up
With no one to stay with
The village used to be all one really needs
Now it's filled with hundreds and hundreds of chemicals
That mostly surround you, you wish to flee
But it's not like you, so listen to me, listen to me
Oh and when the morning comes
We will not find another man in sight
We like the newness, the newness of all
Struggling for so long
Whenever I was a child 
Into something more productive like Roscoe
Been born in eighteen ninety one
Waiting with my aunt Rosaline
Thought we were due for 
A change or two around this place
When they get back they're all mixed up
With no one to stay with
Eighteen ninety one they roamed around and foraged
They made their house from cedars
They made their house from stone
Oh they're a little like you
And they're a little like me
We have all we need
Thought we were due for

Tonight the streets are ours
These lights in our hearts they tell no lies

From our vision and our goals

These lights in our hearts they tell no lies
And no one else can haunt me
The way that you can haunt me
I need to know you want me
I couldn’t be without you
And the light that shines around you
No nothing ever mattered more than not doubting
That tonight the streets are ours
   Do you know how    to kill loneliness at last?
Oh there’s so much there to heal dear
And make tear stains of the past
But do you know that tonight the streets are ours

And whisper all the notes in my ears.""

Says take what you can from your dreams

Each day gets more and more like the last day

Half dead wasn't what I planned to be

  What do you feel when you see the homeless on the street?
  Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep?
  What do you feel when you look in the mirror?
  Are you proud?
How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye   and tell me [Interlude]  why?
  Dear Mr President,   were you a lonely boy?   Are you a lonely boy?
  How can you say   no child is left behind?   We're not dumb, and we're not blind.
  They're all sitting in your cells   while you pave the road to hell.
What kind of  father might take his own daughter's rights away?
  And what kind of  father might hate his own daughter if she were gay?
  I can only i - magine what the first lady has to say   you've come a
long way from whiskey and cocaine
How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye?
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
minimum wage with a baby on the way.
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
re-building your house after the bombs took them away.
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
building a bed out of a cardboard box.
Let me tell you 'bout hard work, hard work, hard work
You don't know nothing 'bout hard work, hard work, hard work!
How do you sleep at night?
How do you walk with your head held high?

Just why we're here
Could it be fate
Or random circumstance
At the right place
At the right time
Two roads intertwine
And if the universe
conspired
To meld our lives
To make us fuel and fire
Then know Where ever
you will be
So too shall I be
Close your eyes
Dry your tears
'Coz when nothing seems clear
You'll be safe here
From the sheer weight
Of your doubts and fears
Weary heart
You'll be safe here
Remember how we laughed
Until we cried
At the most stupid things
Like we were so high
But love was all
that we were on
We belong
And though the world would
Never understand
This unlikely union
And why it still stands
Someday we will
be set free
Pray and believe
When the light disappears
And when this world's insincere
You'll be safe here
When nobody hears you scream
I'll scream with you
You'll be safe here
Save your eyes
From your tears
When everything's unclear
You'll be safe here
From the sheer weight
Of your doubts and fears
Wounded heart
When the light
disappears
And when this world's insincere
You'll be safe here
When nobody
hears you scream
I'll scream with you
You'll be safe here
In my arms
Through the long cold night
Sleep tight
You'll be safe here
When no one
understands
I'll believe
You'll be safe,
You'll be safe
You'll be safe here
Put your heart in my hands
You'll be safe here

 I hear your laugh 
 And look up smiling at you 
 I run and run 
 Past the pumpkin patch 
 And the tractor rides up now 
 The sky is gold 
 I hug your legs and fall asleep 
 On the way home
 I don’t know why all the trees change in the fall
 I know you’re not scared of anything at all 
 Don’t know if Snow White’s house is near or far away 
But I know I had the best day with you today 
 I’m thirteen now
 And don’t know how my friends 
 Could be so mean 
 I come home crying 
 And you hold me tight 
 And grab the keys 
 And we drive and drive 
 Until we’ve found a town 
 Far enough away 
 And we talk and window-shop 
 Until I’ve forgotten all their names 
 I don’t know who I’m gonna talk to now at school 
 I know I’m laughing on the car ride home with you 
 Don’t know how long it’s gonna take to feel okay 
 But I know I had the best day with you today

 His strength is making me stronger 
 God smiles on my little brother 
 Inside and out he’s better than I am

 And I had space to run 
 And I had the best days with you 
 There is a video 
 I found from back when I was three 
 You set up a paint set in the kitchen 
 And you’re talking to me 
 It’s the edge of princesses and pirate ships 
 And the seven dwarves 
 Daddy’s smart and you're the prettiest lady
 In the whole wide world 
 Now I know why all the trees change in the fall 
 I know you were on my side even when I was wrong 
 And I love you for giving me your eyes 
 Staying back and watching me shine

Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said ""Stay away from Juliet"" 
And I was crying on the staircase

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all that's left to do is run

while he stands tall and walking proud.
That look you give that guy, I wanna see...
Looking right at me.
If I could be that guy, instead of me...
I'd never let you down.
It always seems like you're going somewhere,
better than you've been before.

of you knocking on my door.
That look you give that guy, I wanna see...
Looking right at me.

I'd be all I can be. I'd be all I can be.
I'm nothing like what I'd like to be
I'm nothing much, I know it's true.
I lack the style and the pedigree
And my chances are so few

Looking right at me.

I'd give you all I got.

For the highway instead

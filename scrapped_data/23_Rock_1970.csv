There's a message to your movements that really gets my goat
I looked for sniffy linings but you're rotten to the core
I've had just about all I can take, you know I can't take it no more
Got a gut feeling   (repeat this part...)
Got a gut feeling
Centered 'round long time ago on your ability to torment
Then you took your tongs of love and stripped away my garment
I looked for sniffy linings but you're rotten to the core
I've had just about all I can take, you know I can't take it no more
Got a gut feeling   (repeat...)
Got a gut feeling
Slap your Mammy down.  Slap your Pappy down again
Slap your Mammy down.  Slap your Pappy down again

I treated you unkindly but darling can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Baby can't you please see through me
Cause we're alone now 
And I'm singing this song for you

Truth, withholding nothing
You came out in front when I was hiding
But now I'm so much better and if
My words don't come together
Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding
I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life you're a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remebmer when we were together we were alone

I made friends with a lot of peo-ple  in the danger zone
See my  lone-ly life un-fold    I see it ev-ry   day
See my only mind ex-plode,    since I've gone a-way
I think I lost some weight there, And I'm sure I need some rest;
Sleeping don't come very easy  In a straight white vest.
Sure like to see that little children, She's only four years old ole
I'd give her back all her play things even even the one I stole
See my  lone-ly life un-fold     I see it ev-ry  day
See my  lone-ly mind ex-plode,    when I've gone in-sane

See my  lone-ly mind ex-plode,    blow up in my face

I saw a man that was chok-ing there   I guess he couldn't breathe
Said to my-self, this is ver-y strange,  I'm glad it wasn't me;
But now I hear those sirens call-ing  And so I am not     free

That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving
New love - a boy and girl are talking
New words - that only they can share in
New words - a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep - through the fleeting hours of morning
Love is careless in its choosing 
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none, just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love - and love is not loving
Soul love - the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love - and how my God on high is
All love - though reaching up my loneliness evolves
By the blindness that surrounds him
Love is careless in its choosing 
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none, just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love - and love is not loving

He was impressive, young and aggressive, savin' the world on his own.
But the warm summer breezes, the French wine and cheeses put his ambition at bay
The summers and winters scattered like splinters
And four or five years slipped away.
Then he went to England, played the piano, and married an Actress named Kim.
They had a fine life, she was a good wife and bore him a young son named Jim.
And all of the answers and all of the questions he locked in his attic one day
'Cause he liked the quiet clean county livin'
And twenty more years slipped away.
Well the war took his baby, the bombs killed his lady, and left him with only one eye.
His body was battered, his whole world was shattered, and all he could do was just cry.
While the tears were a-fallin' he was recallin' answers he never found.
So he hopped on a freighter, skidded the ocean
And left England without a sound.
Now he lives in the islands, fishes the pilin's and drinks his Green Label each day.
Writing his memoirs, losin' his hearin', but he don't care what people say.
Through eighty-six years of perpetual motion, if he likes you he'll smile, and he'll say
""Jimmy, some of it's magic, some of it's tragic,
But I had a good life all the way.""

Made up my mind to make a new start, going to California with an aching  in my heart
Someone told me theres a girl out there, with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair
Took my chances on a big jet plane, never let them tell you that they're all,  the same
The sea was red and the sky was grey, wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
  As the children of the sun began   to awake.  (watch out!)
Seems that the wrath of the gods got a punch on the nose and it started to flow
  I think I might be sinking.
Throw me a line if I reach it in time, I'll meet you up there where the path
  Runs straight and high.
To find a queen without a king, they say she plays guitar and cries  as she sings
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn,
  Tryin to find a woman who's never, never, never been born.
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams,
  Telling myself its not as hard, hard, hard as it seems.

Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway; I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself this could be heaven or this could be hell
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say
Welcome to the Hotel California.
Such a lovely place, such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (any time of year), you can find it here
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain, ""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine""
And still those voices are calling from far away,
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say...
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis
Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice
And she said 'We are all just prisoners here, of our own device'
And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives,
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
Relax, said the night man, we are programmed to receive
You can check-out any time you like,
But you can never leave!

Where the old world shadows hang, heavy in the air.
She packed her hopes and dreams, like a refugee.
Just as her father came, across the sea.
She heard about a place, people were smiling,
Spoke about the red man's ways, how they loved the land.
They came from everywhere, to the Great Divide,
Seeking a place to stand, or a place to hide.
Down in the crowded bars, out for a good time,
can't wait to tell you all, what it's like up there.
They called it paradise, I don't know why,
somebody laid the mountains low, while the town got high.
And then the chilly winds blew down, across the desert,
through the canyons of the coast, to the Malibu,
Where the pretty people play, hungry for power,
To light their neon ways, give 'em things to do.
Some rich men came and raped the land, nobody caught 'em,
put up a bunch of ugly boxes, and Jesus people bought 'em.
They called it paradise, the place to be,
they watched the hazy sun, sinking in the sea.
We can leave it all behind, and sail to Lahaina,
just like the missionaries did, so many years ago.
They even brought a neon sign, “Jesus is coming”,
brought the white man's burden down, brought the white man's reign.
Who will provide the grand design, what is yours and what is mine,
'cuz there is no more new frontier, we have got to make it here.
We satisfy our endless needs, and justify our bloody deeds,
in the name of destiny, and in the name of God.
And you can see them there, on Sunday morning,
they stand up and sing about, what it's like up there.
They called it paradise, I don't know why
Call someplace paradise, kiss it goodbye.

For love is blind and your far to kind, don't ever let it show.
I wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger, 
I wish that I knew what I know now, when I was stronger.
The Can Can's such a pretty show, they'll steal your heart away,
But backstage's back on earth again, the dressing rooms are gray,
They'll come on strong and it ain't to long, before they make you feel a man,
But love is blind and you soon will find, your just a boy again.
I wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger,
I wish that I knew what I know now, when I was stronger.
When you want her lips, you get her cheek, makes you wonder where you are,
If you want some more, and she's fast asleep, leaves you twinklin' with the stars,
Poor young grandson, there's nothing I can say,
You'll have to learn just like me, and that's the hardest way.

 And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burnin’ bright

 As she was walkin’ on by the arcade
As the light bust through a beat-up shade where he was wakin’ up,
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate

 He didn’t see her anywhere
 He told himself he didn’t care, pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
 Brought on by his simple twist of    fate
 He hears the ticking of the clocks
 And walks along with a parrot that talks
 Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in
Maybe she’ll pick him out again, how long must he wait
One more time for a simple twist of   fate
 People tell me it’s a sin
 To know and feel too much within

The things I did not know at first I learned by doin' twice

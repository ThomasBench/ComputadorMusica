I wont forget,   thats a whole lot
I don't go out,   not now that you're in
Sometimes we shout,   but that's no problem
I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes an' tell that I'm not lyin'
Look at you,   you're a paegent
You're everything,   that I've imagined
When somethings wrong,   I feel uneasy
You show me,   tell me you're not teasing
I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes an' tell that I'm not lyin'
I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes an' tell that I'm not lyin'
There's no doubt,   that when I'm with you
When I'm without,   I stay in my room
Where do you go,   I get no answers
You're always out,   it gets on my nerves
I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes an' tell that I'm not lyin'
But I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes an' tell me you're not lyin'
I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes an' tell that I'm not lyin'

1,Dumb Things (ver 2),Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/paul-kelly-and-the-coloured-girls/dumb-things-chords-1672471,"  Welcome stranger    to the show
  I'm the one who should be ly-ing low
Saw the knives out,    turned my back
  Heard the train coming
stayed right on that track
In the middle,  in the middle
   In the middle of a dream
I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings
I've done all the dumb things
   Caught the fever,   heard the tune
   Thought I loved her, hung my heart on the moon
Started howling,    made no sense
  Thought my friends would rush to my defence
In the middle,  in the middle
   In the middle of a dream
I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings
I've done all the dumb things
   And I get all your   good advice
  Never stops me from going through these things twice
I see the knives out,  I turn my back
  I hear the train coming, I stay right on that track
In the middle, in the middle
   In the middle of a dream
I lost my shirt, I pawned my rings
I've done all the dumb things, 
I melted wax to fix my wings
I've done all the dumb things,   
Yeah I threw my hat into the ring
I've done all the dumb things,  
Well, I thought that I just had to sing
I've done all the dumb things

Felt like a million, felt like number one
The height of summer, I'd never felt that strong
Like a rock.
I was eighteen, didn't have a care
Workin' for peanuts, not a dime to spare
But I was lean and solid everywhere
Like a rock.
My hands were steady, my eyes were clear and bright
My walk had purpose, my steps were quick and light
And I held firm to what I felt was right
Like a rock.
Like a rock - I was strong as I could be
Like a rock - nothin' ever got to me
Like a rock - I was something to see
Like a rock.
And I stood arrow straight, unencumbered by the weight
Of all these hustlers and their schemes
I stood proud, I stood tall, high above it all
I still believed in my dreams.
Twenty years now, where'd they go
Twenty years - I don't know
I sit and I wonder sometimes
where they've gone
And sometimes late at night
Oh when I'm bathed in the firelight
The moon comes callin' a ghostly white
And I recall, I recall.
Like a rock - standin' arrow straight
Like a rock - chargin' from the gate
Like a rock - carryin' the weight
Like a rock.
Like a rock - the sun upon my skin
Like a rock - hard against the wind
Like a rock - I see myself again
Like a rock,

Now I work down at the carwash
Where all it ever does is rain

We had it once we ain't got it any more""
She packed her bags left me behind
She bought a ticket on the Central Line
Nights as I sleep, I hear that whistle whining
I feel her kiss in the misty rain
And I feel like I'm a rider on a downbound train
Last night I heard your voice
You were crying, crying, you were so alone
You said your love had never died
You were waiting for me at home
Put on my jacket, I ran through the woods
I ran till I thought my chest would explode
There in the clearing, beyond the highway
In the moonlight, our wedding house shone
I rushed through the yard, I burst through the front door
My head pounding hard, upstairs I climbed
The room was dark, our bed was empty
Then I heard that long whistle whine
And I dropped to my knees, hung my head and cried
Now I swing a  hammer on a road gang
Knocking down them cross ties, working in the rain
Now don't it feel like you're a rider on a downbound train

And follow your dreams down

Like soldiers in the winter's night with a vow to defend
No retreat baby no surrender
Well now young faces grow sad and old
And hearts of fire grow cold
We swore blood brothers against the wind
Now I'm ready to grow young again
And hear your sister's voice calling us home
Across the open yard
Well maybe we can cut someplace of our own
With these drums and these guitars
Well we made a promise we swore we'd always remember
No retreat baby no surrender
Blood brothers in the stormy night with a vow to defend
No retreat baby no surrender

Lay lay lay lay lay lay lay, lay lay lay lay lay 2x

You say it ain't ours anymore to win
I want to sleep beneath peaceful skies
In my lover's bed
With the wide open country in my eyes
And these romantic dreams in my head
Because we made a promise we swore we'd always remember
No retreat baby no surrender
Blood brothers in the stormy night with a vow to defend
No retreat baby no surrender
No retreat baby no surrender
Ooohhh, ooohhh, ohhhhh
Ooohhh, ooohhh, ohhhhh 2x

Just try to see in the dark

I make the shapes come much too close
hold my breath and wait until I shake...
But if I had your faith
then I could make it safe and clean
If only I was sure
that my head on the door was a dream

And secretaries turn off typewriters and put on their coats
Janitors padlock the gates for security guards to patrol
And bachelors phone up their friends for a drink While the married ones 
turn on a chat show
And theyll all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow
Gentlemen time please, you know we cant serve anymore
Now the traffic lights change to stop, when theres nothing to go
And by five oclock everythings dead
And every third car is a cab, and ignorant people sleep in their beds,
Like the doped white mice in the college lab
And Nothing ever happens, nothing happens at all.
The needle returns to the start of the song,
And we all sing along like before,
And well all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow.
Telephone exchanges click while theres nobody there,
The martians could land in the carpark and no one would care.
Close-circuit cameras in department stores shoot the same video everyday.
And the stars of these films neither die nor get killed,
Just survive constant action replay
And Nothing ever happens, nothing happens at all.
The needle returns to the start of the song,
And we all sing along like before,
And well all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow.
Bill hoardings advertise products that nobody needs
While angry from manchester writes to complain about all the repeats on t.v.
And computer terminals report some gains, on the values of copper and tin
While american businessmen snap up van goghs for the price of a hospital 
wing
And nothing ever happens, nothing happens at all
The needle returns to the start of the song,
And we all sing along like before,
And nothing ever happens, nothing happens at all,
Theyll burn down the synagogues at six oclock
And well all go along like before,
And well all be lonely tonight and lonely tomorrow.

In your little corner of the world?
You could roll around the globe
And never find a warmer soul to know
Oh I saw you by the wall
Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
With eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart a captive in the snow
Oh Nikita you will never know
Anything about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Oh,      Nikita I need you so
Oh, Nikita is the other side
Of any given line in time
Counting ten tin soldiers in a row?
Oh    no, Nikita you'll never know
   Do you ever dream of me?
Do you ever see the letters that I write?
When you look up through the wire
Nikita do you count the stars at night?
And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend
Oh Nikita you will never know
Anything about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Oh,      Nikita I need you so
Oh, Nikita is the other side

It kept his motor running, But it never kept him clean
They say he loved adventure.

And they're closing all the factories down
Out in Bethlehem they're killing time
Filling out forms
Standing in line.
Well our fathers fought the Second World War
Spent their weekends on the Jersey Shore
Met our mothers at the USO
Asked them to dance
Danced with them slow
And we're living here in Allentown.
But the restlessness was handed down
And it's getting very hard to staaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
Well we're waiting here in Allentown
For the Pennsylvania we never found
For the promises our teachers gave
If we worked hard
If we behaved.
So the graduations hang on the wall
But they never really helped us at all
No they never taught us what was real
Iron or coke,
Chromium steel.
And we're waiting here in Allentown.
But they've taken all the coal from the ground
And the union people crawled awaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
Every child had a pretty good shot
To get at least as far as their old man got.
If something happened on the way to that place
They threw an American flag in our face, 
Well I'm living here in Allentown
And it's hard to keep a good man down.
But I won't be getting up todaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy

        Got on a lucky one, came in eighteen to one
I've got a feeling this year's for me and you
So Happy Christmas, I love you baby
I can see a better time when all our dreams come true
They've got cars
Big as bars
They've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you
It's no place for the old
When you first took my hand
On a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me
Broadway was waiting for me
You were handsome
Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on the corner
Then danced through the night
The boys of the NYPD choir
Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing
Out for Christmas day
You're a bum
You're a punk
You're an old slut on junk
Living there almost dead on a drip
In that bed
You scum bag
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse
I pray God
It's our last
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells are ringing
Out for Christmas Day
I could have been someone
Well, so could anyone
You took my dreams
From me when I first found you
I kept them with me babe
I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone
I've built my dreams around you
The boys of the NYPD choir
Still singing 'Galway Bay'

Did the night just take up your time, 'cause it means more to me

Regret what I've done, regret you? I couldn't go on

 I'll tell you this

Has punched a hole in the night-time, yes.
 I climb through the window and down to the street,
I'm shining like a new dime.
 The downtown trains are full,
 With all of those Brooklyn girls.
 They try so hard to break out of their little worlds.
 Well, you wave your hand and they scatter like crows,
They have nothing that will ever capture your heart.
 They're just thorns, without the rose;
Be careful of them in the dark.
 Oh, if I was the one, you chose to be your only one.
Oh baby, can't you hear me now? Can't you hear me now?
 Will I see you to-night,
 On a downtown train?
 Every night it's just the same;     you leave me lonely, now.
 I know your window and I know it's late,
I know your stairs and your doorway.
 I walk down your street and past your gate,
I stand by the light at the four-way.
 You watch them as they fall,
Oh baby, they all have heart-attacks.
They stay at the carnival but they'll never win you back.
 Will I see you to-night,
 On a downtown train?
Where every night, every night, it's just the same,     oh baby...
 Will I see you to-night,
 On a downtown train?
 All of my dreams, they fall like rain, oh baby, on a downtown train.
 Will I see you to-night,
 On a downtown train?
Where every night, every night, it's just the same,     oh baby...
 Will I see you to-night,
 On a downtown train?
 All of my dreams, they fall like rain, oh baby, on a downtown train.
   All on a downtown train, all on a downtown train.
 All on a downtown train, a downtown train.

But I wish that I had started long before I did
And there's so much time to make up everywhere you turn
Time we have wasted on the way
So much water moving underneath the bridge
Let the water come and carry us away
Oh, when you were young, did you question all the answers
Did you envy all the dancers who had all the nerve
Look around you now, you must go for what you wanted
Look at all my friends who did and got what they deserved
And there's so much time to make up everywhere you turn
Time we have wasted on the way
So much water moving underneath the bridge

      And his heart was known to none
      He left his home and went his lone and solitary way
      And he gave to me a gift I know I never can repay
      A quiet man of music denied a simpler fate
      He tried to be a soldier once, but his music wouldn't wait
      He earned his love through discipline, a thundering velvet hand
      His gentle means of sculpting souls took me years to understand

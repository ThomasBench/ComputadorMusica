I know your minds made up, you're gonna cause more misery.

And you've got time to rectify all the things that you should.

Got   my-self   arrested,        wound  me  up  in  jail
Richmond 'bout to blow up,      communication       fails
If  you see  the  answer,         now's the time to say
What   I   want,  all I want is to get you  down  & pray

Saw   the    people   standin',     a thousand  years in  chains
Somebody  said  it's  different now;  look, it's just the same
Pharaohs  spin   the  message,       'round  & 'round the truth
They could've saved a million people, how  can  I   tell  you?

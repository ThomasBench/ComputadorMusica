0,Make You Feel My Love (ver 4),Bob Dylan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bob-dylan/make-you-feel-my-love-chords-1189445,"When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love
The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
                                  (Fade)

1,I Saw The Light,Todd Rundgren,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/todd-rundgren/i-saw-the-light-chords-538783," It was late last night
 I was feeling something wasn't right
 There was not another soul in sight
 Only you, only you
 So we walked along,
 though I knew that there was something wrong
 And the feeling hit me oh so strong about you
 Then you gazed up at me and the answer was plain to see
 'Cause I saw the light 
 In your eyes 
 in your eyes
 Though we had our fling
 I just ne__ver would suspect a thing
 'Til that little bell began to ring in my head, in my head
 But I tried to run, 
 though I knew it wouldn't help me none
 'Cause I couldn't ever love no one, or so I said
 But my feelings for you were just something I never knew
 'Til I saw the light 
 In your eyes 
 In your eyes
 But I love you best
 It's not something that I say in jest
 'Cause you're different girl from all the rest, in my eyes
 And I ran out before but I won't do it anymore
 Can't you see the light 
In my eyes           (x4)

Are you still so afraid?
Where's the fire, what's the hurry about?
You better cool it off before you burn it out
You got so much to do and only
So many hours in a day
But you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want
Or you can just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through, Oh oh
When will you realise...Vienna waits for you
Slow down you're doing fine
You can't be everything you want to be before your time
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight, tonight
Too bad but it's the life you lead
You're so ahead of yourself that you forgot what you need
Though you can see when you're wrong
You know you can't always see when you're right, you're right
You got your passion you got your pride
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied?
Dream on but don't imagine they'll all come true, Oh oh
When will you realise...Vienna waits for you
Slow down you crazy child
Take the phone off the hook and disappear for a while
It's alright you can afford to lose a day or two, Oh oh
When will you realise...Vienna waits for you
And you know that when the truth is told

And if I claim to be a wise man
It surely means that I don't know
On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about, I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say
Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
   Carry on
You will always remember
   Carry on
Nothing equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
Surely Heaven waits for you
Carry on my wayward son
There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest
Don't you cry {vocal echo: Don't you cry} no more

Got to keep the loonies on the path.

And every day the paper boy brings more.

And if there is no room upon the hill
  And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.

  The lunatic is in my head
  You raise the blade, you make the change
  You re-arrange me 'till I'm sane.
  You lock the door
And throw away the key
There's someone in my head but it's not me.
  And if the cloud bursts, thunder in your ear
  You shout and no one seems to hear.
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.

Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim; I had to stop for the night.
There she stood in the doorway; I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself, ""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor I thought I heard them say...
Welcome to the Hotel California...
Such a lovely place, (such a lovely place) such a lovely face...
Plenty of room at the Hotel California...
Any time of year, (any time of year) you can find it here...
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes Bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain, ""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine""
And still those voices are calling from far away,
Wake you up in the middle of the night just to hear them say...
Welcome to the Hotel California...
Such a lovely place, (such a lovely place) such a lovely face...
They livin' it up at the Hotel California...
What a nice surprise, (what a nice surprise) bring your alibis...
Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice
And she said ""We are all just prisoners here, of our own device""

For love is blind and you're far too kind   Don't ever let it show
I wish that I knew what I know now   When I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now   When I was stronger.
The Can Can's such a pretty show   They'll steal your heart away
But backstage, back on earth again   The dressing rooms are grey
They come on strong and it ain't too long   Before they make you feel a man
But love is blind and you soon will find   You're just a boy again

I wish that I knew what I know now   When I was stronger.

If you want some more and she's fast asleep   Leaves you twinkling with the stars.

You'll have to learn, just like me  And that's the hardest way

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water,     fire in the sky
Smoke on the water...
They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water,     fire in the sky
Smoke on the water...
We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights and a few old beds
We make a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know, I know we'll never forget

His horse and his cattle are his only companions
He works in the saddle and he sleeps in the canyons
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire
Thinkin' about women and glasses of beer
Closing his eyes as the dogies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear
Goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rock-a-bye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams
And rock-a-bye sweet baby James
Now the first of December was covered with snow
And so was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston
Lord, the Berkshires seemed dreamlike on account of that frosting
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go
There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway
A song that they sing when they take to the sea
A song that they sing of their home in the sky
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep
But singing works just fine for me
Goodnight you moonlight ladies
Rock-a-bye sweet baby James
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose
Won't you let me go down in my dreams

It's late September and I really should be back at school.
I know I keep you amused, but I feel I'm being used.
Oh, Maggie, I couldn't have tried any more.
You lured me away from home, just to save you from being alone.
You stole my heart and that's what really hurts.
The morning sun, when it's in your face really shows your age.
But that don't worry me none; in my eyes you're everything.
I laughed at all of your jokes, my love you didn't need to coax,
Oh, Maggie I couldn't have tried any more.
You lured me away from home, just to save you from being alone.
You stole my soul that's a pain I can do without.
All I need was a friend to lend a guiding hand.  
But you turned into a lover and Mother what a lover your wore me out.
All you did was wreck my bed, and in the morning kick me in the head,
Oh, Maggie I couldn't have tried any more.
You lured me away from home, just to save you from being alone.
You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried.
I suppose I could collect my books and get back to school.
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool.
Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helping hand,
Oh, Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face.
You made a first class fool out of me, 
but I'm as blind as a fool can be.
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway.

When blackness was a virtue   The road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness   A creature void of form
Come in she said I'll give ya   Shelter from the storm
And if I pass this way again   You can rest assured
I'll always do my best for her   On that I give my word
In a world of steel-eyed death and men  Who are fighting to be warm
Come in she said I'll give ya   Shelter from the storm
Not a word was spoke between us   There was little risk involved
Everything up to that point   Had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place    Where it's always safe and warm
Come in she said I'll give ya   Shelter from the storm
I was burned out from exhaustion  Buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes   And blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile    Ravaged in the corn
Come in she said I'll give ya   Shelter from the storm
Suddenly I turned around   And she was standing there
With silver bracelets on her wrists  And flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully  And took my crown of thorns
Come in she said I'll give ya   Shelter from the storm
Now there's a wall between us  somethin' there's been lost
I took too much for granted got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began on a long forgotten morn
Come in she said  I'll give you shelter from the storm
Well the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much it's doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker he blows a futile horn
Come in she said  I'll give you shelter from the storm
I've heard newborn babies wailin' like a mournin' dove
And old men with broken teeth stranded without love
Do I understand your question then is it hopeless and forlorn
Come in she said  I'll give you shelter from the storm
In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation and they gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn
Come in she said  I'll give you shelter from the storm
Well I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor's edge someday I'll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born

As the limousine pulls out, of Alice's drive
Oh, I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go.
I guess she's got her reasons, but I just don't wanna know.
Cause for twenty-four years I've been living next door to Alice.
Twenty-four years just waiting for a chance,
to tell her how I feel, and maybe get a second glance,
now I've got to get used to not living next door to Alice.
Then Sally called back and asked how I felt,
And she said: ""I know how to help - get over Alice"".
She said: ""Now Alice is gone, but I'm still here,
you know I've been waiting for twenty-four years...""
Oh, I don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go.
I guess she's got her reasons, but I just don't wanna know.
Cause for twenty-four years I've been living next door to Alice.
Twenty-four years just waiting for a chance,
to tell her how I feel, and maybe get a second glance,
now I've got to get used to not living next door to Alice.
No, I'll never get used to not living next door to Alice...

I knew he musta been about seventeen
The beat was going strong
Playin' my favorite song
Till he was with me, yeah me, singin'
I love rock n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock n' roll
So come an' take your time an' dance with me
He smiled so I got up an' asked for his name
That don't matter, he said, 'Cause it's all the same
Said can I take you home
where we can be alone
He was with me, yeah me, singin'
I love rock n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock n' roll
So come an' take your time an' dance with me
Said can I take you home where we can be alone

Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
And when the broken hearted people, living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light that shines on me
Shine on till tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

49,Simple Twist Of Fate,Bob Dylan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bob-dylan/simple-twist-of-fate-chords-806584,"   They sat together in the park
   As the evening sky grew dark
   She looked at him and he felt a spark
Tingle to his bones
   'Twas then he felt alone
And wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate
   They walked along by the old canal
   A little confused, I remember well
   And stopped into a strange hotel
With a neon burning bright
He felt the heat of the night
Hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate
   A saxophone someplace far off played
   As she was walking on by the arcade
   As the light bust through a beat-up shade
Where he was waking up
She dropped a coin into the cup
Of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about his simple twist of fate
(*no lyrics - harmonica solo*)
(*no lyrics - harmonica solo*)
   He woke up, the room was bare
   He didn't see her anywhere
   He told himself he didn't care
Pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside
To which he just could not relate
   Brought on by a simple twist of fate
   He hears the ticking of the clocks
   And walks along with a parrot that talks
   Hunts her down by the waterfront docks
Where the sailors all come in
Maybe she'll pick him out again
How long must he wait
One more time for a simple twist of fate
   People tell me its a sin
   To know and feel too much within
   I still believe she was my twin
But I lost the ring
She was born in spring
But I was born too late
Blame it on a simple twist of fate
(*no lyrics - harmonica solo*)

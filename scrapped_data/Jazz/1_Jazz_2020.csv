   I love my baby
  Wheels up and I'm on my way
  Been three weeks since I've seen my baby
Send a text as we're touching down
  But she's already circlin' round on the ground
Waiting
She's waiting just for me
  I won't forget it, I won't forget it (get it get it)
  You won't regret it, I won't forget this, hey!
  I love my baby, she's the best
  What gets me through the longest flight (From Cape Town through Dubai)
  My baby baby, she's the best
  Can't wait to hold my honey pie (I can't wait to kiss and hug her)
  Won't be long now, I'm on my way (I'll be)
  All over you, like I'm TSA (TSA)
  Brought you something back from a distant land
  She brought fajitas from a taco stand (Understand)
She's waiting
She's waiting just for me
  I won't forget it, I won't forget it (get it get it)
  You won't regret it, I won't forget this baby, hey!
  I love my baby, she's the best
  What gets me through the longest flight (From Cape Town through Dubai)
  My baby baby, she's the best
  I'm gonna make it up tonight (I can't wait to kiss and hug her)
Baby, got my bags
Headed out to the street
Now you saved my life,   it means everything
  I love my baby, she's the best
  She picks me up at LAX

Song birds sing; Winter turns to Spring.
Every winding street in Mayfair falls beneath the spell.
I know such enchantment could be for it happened one evening to me.
That certain night, The night we met, There was magic abroad in the air.
There were an  -  gels  di  -  ning at the Ritz  
And a nightingale sang in Berke - ley    Square
I may be right, I may be wrong, But I'm perfectly willing to swear
That when  you  turned and smiled at me, A   nightingale sang in Berke - ley   Square.
The moon that lingered over London town Poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown
How could he know we two were so in love The whole darn world seemed upside down.
The streets of town were paved with stars It was such a romantic affair
And as    we   kissed and said ""good-night"" A   nightingale sang in Berke - ley   Square
When dawn came stealing up all gold and blue, To interrupt our rendezvous.
I still remember how you smiled and said, ""Was that a dream or was it true?""
Our homeward step was just as light As the dancing of Fre-ed Astaire

If you love me,   let me know
Once the moon should take her bow

And sadness wonders what we're gonna do

Then sadness comes to sing a song for you

The postman comes and says there's still no news
Deep in the city, oh yeah
The buildings wonder if they'll ever be built
Oh, what an interesting day
Looks like there's nobody in my way
But the road's gonna end
Looks like nobody wins today
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun

Here comes the sun
Here come the blazing amazing miracle sun
And it's raging on and still, we'll blaze along

It's a hard blow to take with all of its might
And it tries to be sorry, it tries to be sweet
Then it runs out the door as if on two feet
And I stand there and wonder when will I be free
Then I realized I held it, it never held me
It had to hurt me to finally be gone
'Cus I made the mistake of dragging it on

This is just the thing;
That oh, I've been dreaming of.
The promises you know, promise you know.
In love, we've come so far.
Look to the stars, hold on to me.
Take my wings, hold on tight,
cling to my love, hold on to me.
A luv, falling from grace,
can rise from the ashes
and fall into place.
Love is just like a phoenix.
It can fly, it can glow.
And it's based upon the dreams,
that we've both been dreaming of.
Oh, the promise you know, promise you know.
Love is just like a phoenix.
Let it sky, let it grow.
This is just the sort of thing;
That we've both been hoping for.
The promises you know, promise you know.
So let's rise, rise, rise.
Rise, rise, rise.
Rise, rise, rise.
Rise, rise, rise, oh,oh ah,ah, rise.
(Sax)
Love is just like a phoenix.
It can fly, it can grow.
And is based upon the dreams,
that we've both been dreaming of.
And oh, the promises you know, promise you know.
Love is just like a phoenix.
Let it sky, let it grow.
This is just what we both been dreaming of.
Of the promises you know, promise you know.
Rise, rise, rise
Rise, rise, rise
Rise, rise, rise
Rise, rise, rise..............

45,To Live,Norah Jones,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/norah-jones/to-live-chords-3202070,"Ooh
Ooh
To live in this moment
And finally be free
No chains holding me
If love is the answer
In front of my face
Then I'll live in this moment
And find my true place
These cracks in my heart
Can't be filled with cement
All the time that I've spent
I want a life in color
To breathe outside the lines
To live in this moment
Find peace in my mind
Ooh
Ooh
Who said all those things
To make you go and hide?
That you can't come outside
Please, throw down the darkness
As best as you can
And live in this moment
I'll reach out my hand
To live in this moment
And finally be free
Is what I was after
No chains holding me
If love is the answer
In front of my face
I'll live in this moment
And find my true place
I'll live in this moment
And find my true place
I'll live in this moment
And find my true place
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

'Cause I'm looking at pictures of you
While I listen to snow
Being pushed off of the roof
I can't stand it
When I forget the things that I've got
And I'm wondering why
They were not in my life, no sign
I was mistaken
When I thought we could have it all
We can see what we wanna see
Before we have to fall
I'm just smiling
At the thought of a day long ago
When you asked me to stay and I left
At the fork in the road
We were dancing
In the place where your heart was in love
And the pieces were in the right place
Sent from Heaven above

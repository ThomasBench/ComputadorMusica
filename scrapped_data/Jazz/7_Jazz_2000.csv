do you still hum the old
melodies?
do you wish people 
listened
over here with me?

i will talk to you
though you're faraway
and we'll sing
through the years.

Piecing together the fragments of a frame
Why my motor skills are out of phase

One of those bells that now and then rings

Was too hot not to cool down

Just creep on in
Creep on in

Won't stop until it's done

Hopelessly out of control
There's deceivers and believers and old in-betweeners
That seem to have no place to go
Well it's the same old song, it's right and it's wrong
And livin' is just something that I do
And with no place to hide, I looked in your eyes
And I found myself in you
I looked to the stars, tried all of the bars
And I've nearly gone up in smoke 
Now my hand's on the wheel of somethin' that's real
And I feel like I'm goin' home
And in the shade of an oak, down by the river
Sat an old man and a boy
Settin' sails, spinnin tales, and fishin' for whales
With a lady that they both enjoy
Well it's the same damn tune, it's the man and the moon
It's the way that I feel about you
And with no place to hide, I looked in your eyes
And I found myself in you
I looked to the stars, tried all of the bars
And I've nearly gone up in smoke 
Now my hand's on the wheel of somethin' that's real
And I feel like I'm goin' home

Here I am looking for signs of leaving

And I'll be thinkin' about you
I'll be thinkin' about you
When you sail across the ocean waters
And you reach the other side safely
Could you smile a little smile for me?

So lay me down with a sad song,

Gone too long.

Come find me somewhere between my dreams,
With the sun on my face.

of tenderness
And so much love
you can get no rest
If you're willing to waste a little time
I don't wanna all of it
All I need is a little bit
You got a lot of
money saved
No use taking it
all to your grave
Ain't worth nothing If you ain't feelin' fine
I don't wanna all of it
All I need is a little bit
You know daddy gave you everything on a silver platter
But the one thing he never gave you
Was the one thing that really matters
So if you feel 
unsatisfied
Something missing 
deep down inside
You had so many lovers But you never really tried
I don't wanna all of it
All I need is a little bit
Telling you not getting dark  It's getting late
Now ain't we all need someone To sit down and set us free
You got gold to give 
and time to pray
You think living right 
is living your way
But there's heaven down here, baby  We can find it if we try
I don't wanna all of it
All I need is a little bit
I don't wanna all of it
All I need is a little bit

If you smile through your fear and sorrow,
Smile, and maybe tomorrow
You'll see the sun come shining through for you
Light up your face with gladness,
Hide ev'ry trace of sadness,
Although a tear may be e-ver so near,
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worth while
If you'll just smile
If you'll just smile

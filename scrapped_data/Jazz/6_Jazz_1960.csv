How I cried last night
For I knew warning you've given me last night
Now it's over yes its over
And all my tears are all too late
I won't sleep tonight
I will weep tonight
But the year fill with tears would not put this right
For I have lost you, I lost you
Now I'm only little miss lonely
A tear is such a very lonely thing
But crying is the only thing that I can find to do since I lost you
I'm wiser now, so much wiser now
But my wisdom is the wisdom of a fool somehow
For I love you, I still love you
But I'm only little miss lonely
A tear is such a very lonely thing
But crying is the only thing that I can find to do since I lost you
I'm wiser now, so much wiser now
But my wisdom is the wisdom of a fool somehow
For I love you, I still love you
But I'm only little miss lonely
For I love you, I still love you
But I'm only little miss lonely

Skjortan är ren och blicken blank
Blicken är blank av kärlekskval
Och osammanhängande är hans tal

Skönaste damen i vår stad
Helt utan konkurrens jag svär
""Jävlar i det"" sa polaren Per
Polaren Per är full av glöd
Blicken är blank och kinden röd
Kinden är röd och Per förstörd
Men Ann-Katarin är oberörd
Ann-Katarin Rosenblad
Tuffaste damen i vår stad
Hårdare än granit jag svär
""Jävlar i det"" sa polaren Per
Hon bjöd mig hem till sig en kväll
Vi satt i hennes dyschatell
Och drack en massa alkohol
Fantastiskt vad den damen tål
Ann-Katarin Rosenblad
Hon sveper en åtta drinkar i rad
Utan att blinka, jo jag svär
""Jävlar i det"" sa polaren Per
Jag hade med mig min gitarr
Spelte och sjöng med känsla och darr
Men när jag bad om en kyss till tack
Så fick jag en smäll så läppen sprack
Ann-Katarin Rosenblad
Temperament till den milda grad
Muskler av stål både här och där
""Jävlar i det"" sa polaren Per
Men kärlekens makt är stor som ni vet
Först var hon kall men sen var hon het
Först sa hon nej, och sen sa hon ja
Därefter blev allt som det skulle va
Ann-Katarin Rosenblad
Först var hon sur och sedan glad
Därefter fylldes hon av begär
""Jävlar i det"" sa polaren Per
Men kärleken var av kortvarig art
Ut ur mitt liv försvann hon med fart
Då hade jag knappt ett öre kvar
Och nu är hon inte anträffbar

Dyraste damen i vår stad
Kostade mer än det smakade där

The who, the how, the why  they dish the dirt, it never ends.
The weaker sex, the ""speaker"" sex we mortal males behold
But though we joke, we wouldn't trade you for a ton of gold
So baby stay and gab away, but hear me say that after
Girl talk, talk  to  me
But that's a dame, they're all the same it's just a game they call it
Girl talk, girl talk
So baby stay, and gab away, but hear me say
That after girl talk, talk  to  me

Raised in every bar across the Argentine

To the lone  ly summer lov   ers

How old am I?,
I'm old enough   to know
The difference between infatuation
And a love that has a chance to grow
How old am I?,
I'm not too old to hear
The sweet ring of truth and understanding
When the words ""I love you"" reach my ear
Don't mind these lines beneath my eyes,
  they're well - earned souvenirs
Of a thousand nights of laughter
and occasional tears
And I hope you won't be jealous
of the silver in my hair
It took many lover's quarrels to put it
there
How old am I?,
you kiss me ..and I'm young
Love's a road never traveled, life's a song..
I've never sung
If I make you happy today,
I'm the perfect age
As for tomorrow

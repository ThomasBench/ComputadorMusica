0,Just One Of Those Things,Cole Porter,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/cole-porter/just-one-of-those-things-chords-1485381,"As Dorothy Parker once said
To her boyfriend, ""Fare thee well,""
As Columbus announced when he knew he was bounced,
""It was swell, Isabel, swell,""
As Abe-lard said to Elo---ise,
""Don't forget to drop a line to me, please,""
As Juliet cried, in her Romeo's ear,
""Romeo, why not face the fact, my dear?""
It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings
Just one of those things
It was just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon  on gossamer wings
Just one of those things
If we'd thought a bit, of the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot, not to cool down
So goodbye, dear, and Amen
Here's hoping we meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just  one of those things

1,Thats All There Is To This Song,Willie Nelson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/willie-nelson/thats-all-there-is-to-this-song-chords-4122070," The night that we met I heard music
 The words started coming, so I wrote her a song
 She loved every line
 That flowed from my mouth
And I sang it to her all night long
It was easy to write about her blue eyes
And her sweet smile and her body and her smile oh, touching me
I made her mine with just a few lines
And a three quarter time melody
That's all there is to this song
 The dream that she was has moved on
All the words to the verses are gone
 That's all there is to this song
 That's all there is to this song
 The dream that she was has moved on
All the words to the verses are gone
 And that's all there is to this song

In London town,
Had me low, it
Had me down,
    I viewed the morning, with alarm,
    The British museum,     had lost its charm.
How long I wondered,
    Could this thing last,
But the age of miracles,
It hadn't past,
   Suddenly, I saw you there,  and in
Foggy London town the sun was shin-ing,  eve - ry -where.

I'll tell you what's playing at the Roxy.
It's a picture about a Minnesota man so in love with a Mississippi girl
that he sacrifices everything and moves all the way to Biloxi.
That's what's playing at the Roxy.
What's in the daily news?
I'll tell what's in the daily news.
Story about a guy who bought his wife a small ruby
with what otherwise would have been his union dues.
That's what's in the daily news.
What's happening all over?
I'll tell you what's happening all over.
Guys sitting home by a television set who used to be
something of a rover.
That's what's happening all over.
Love is the thing that has licked 'em?
And it looks like I am just another victim.
When you see a guy reach for stars in the sky,
You can bet that he's doing it for some doll
When you spot a John waiting out in the rain,
Chances are he's insane, as only a John can be for a Jane.
When you meet a gent paying all kinds of rent
For a flat that could flatten the Taj Mahal,
Call it sad, call it funny, but it's better than even money,
That's the guy's only doing it for some doll.
When you see a Joe saving half of his dough,
You can bet they'll be minting it for some doll,
When a bum buys wine like a bum can't afford,
It's a cinch that the bum is under the thumb of some little broad
When you meet a mug lately out of the jug,
And he's still lifting platinum folderol
Call it hell, call it heaven, it's a probable twelve to seven
That's a guy's only doing it for some doll.
Some doll.some doll.
The guy's only doing it for some doll.
Call it hell, call it heaven, it's a probable twelve to seven
That's a guy's only doing it for some doll.
Some doll.some doll.
The guy's only doing it for some doll.

Counting all the stars

How the breeze ruffled through her hair
How we always laughed as though tomorrow wasn't there

Where did it go?

Everything was ours
How happy we were then

15,Winter Wonderland,Ella Fitzgerald,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ella-fitzgerald/winter-wonderland-chords-3962377,"Over the ground lies a mantle of white
A heaven of diamonds shine down through the night
Two hearts are thrillin’ in spite of the chill in the
weather
Love knows no season love knows no clime
Romance can blossom any old time
Here in the open we're walking and hoping
together
Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,
In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight.
Walking in a winter wonderland.
Gone away is the bluebird,
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song, As we go along,
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say ""Are you married?"" We'll say ""No man"",
But you can do the job when you're in town.
Later on, we'll conspire,
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made,
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman,
Then pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mr Snowman
Until the other children knock him down.
When it snows, ain't it thrilling,
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way,
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland
Walking in a winter wonderland

And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.    (Where)

44,What A Wonderful World (ver 18),Louis Armstrong,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/louis-armstrong/what-a-wonderful-world-chords-2604114,"I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom, for me and you,
And I think to myself, What a  wonderful world.
I see skies of blue and clouds of white,
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night,
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people goin' by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, ""How do you do?""
They're really saying,  ""I   love    you.""
I Hear Babies cry, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
Yes I think to myself, what a wonderful world.

45,Change Partners,Frank Sinatra,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/frank-sinatra/change-partners-chords-1854389,"Melody
 Must you dance every dance
with the same fortunate man?
You have danced with him since the music began,
won't you change  partners and  dance with me?
 Must you dance quite so close,
with your lips touching his face?
Can't you see I'm longing to be in his place?
Won't you change partners and dance with me?
Ask him to sit this one out and while you're lone,
I'll tell the waiter to tell him he's wanted on the telephone
You've been locked in his arms
ever since
heaven knows when...
Won't you change partners and then
you may never want to change partners again

But the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before.
All at  once am I, several stories high,
Knowing I'm, on the street, where you live.
Are there lilac trees, in the heart of  town,
Can you hear a lark in any other part of town.
Does en...chantment pour, out of every door,
No, it's just, on the street, where you live.
And, oh, the towering feeling, just to know somehow you are near,
The over..powering feeling, that any second you may suddenly appear.
Peo..ple stop and stare, they don't bother me.
For there's nowhere else on earth that I   would rather be.
Let the time go by, I won't care if I,
Can be  here on the street where you live.    
Peo..ple stop and stare, they don't bother me,
For there's nowhere else on earth that I   would rather be.

Can be  here, on the street, where you live...

Will find it hard to sleep to.... night

He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas........... to.. you

The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night,

Are also on the faces of people goin' by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, ""How do you do?""
They're really saying,  ""I   love    you.""
I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know,
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
Yes I think to myself,      what a wonderful world.

 Jimmy was your sweetie pie, your precious one.
And I knew you used to love the very ground he walked upon.
One day, Jim's papa told him things were looking down,
And they packed up everything they owned and left this little old town.
Each tear I dried for you; the closer our live's grew,
I fell in love, it's true; and you say you love me, too.

I don't want to be a loser, if you have to make a choice.
Like a puppet to a string, to you, girl, I'm at-tached.
And I know I'd be in trouble if he came and took you back.

Lingering sunsets
Stay a little longer

At bad men, shoot at me
Take me to that strange
Enchanted land grown-ups
Seldom understand
Wandering rainbows
Leave a bit of color
For my heart   to  own
Stars in the sky
Make my wish come true
Before the night has flown
And let the music play
As long as there's a song to sing
Then I will stay younger than Spring

I may be right, I may be wrong,

That when you turned and smiled at me,      
A nightingale sang in Berkeley  Square.
The moon that lingered over London town, 
Poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown,
How could he know we two were so in  love, 
The whole darn world seemed upside down.
The streets of town were paved with stars, 
It was such a romantic affair,
And as we kissed and said goodnight,    
A nightingale sang in Berkeley  Square.
When dawn came steaming up all gold and blue, 
To interupt our rendezvous
I still remember how you smiled and said, 
Was that a dream or was it true?
Our homeward step was just as light, 
As the tap dancing feet of Astaire,
And like an echo, far away,

Domani,      forget domani
Let's live for now and an - y - how who needs domani?
The moonlight, let's share the moonlight
Perhaps together we will never be again
 Ah, che luna,      oh, che mare
With such a moon and such a sea and you and me
I get so dizzy when you're standing near
It's not the music that you hear
My heart is beating like a jungle drum
Let's take the minutes as they speed away
And hope it's true what people say
""When you're in love, tomorrow never comes""
Let's forget about tomorrow,   let's forget about tomorrow
Let's forget about tomorrow for tomorrow never comes.
Let's forget about tomorrow,   let's forget about tomorrow
Let's forget about tomorrow for tomorrow never comes.

42,My Way (ver 8),Frank Sinatra,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/frank-sinatra/my-way-chords-1970997,"And now, the end is near, and so I  face, the fin-al  curtain.
My friend, I'll  say it clear; I'll state my case, of which, I'm certain.
I've lived, a live that's full, I’ve  travelled  each, and every highway;
And more, much more than this, I did it,  my …… way.
Regrets, I've had a  few, but then a - gain, too few to mention.
I  did, what I had to do, and saw it through, without, exemption.
I planned, each chattered course, each careful  step, along the byway;
And more, much more than this, I did it,   my …… way.
Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew, when I  bit off, more, than I could chew.
But thru it all, when there was doubt,  I ate it up, and spit it  out;
I  faced it all, and I  stood tall, and did it,    my ……. way.
I’ve loved, I’ve laughed and cried, I’ve had my fill, my share of losing.
And now, as  tears subside, I find it all, so, am - u – sing.
To think, I did all that, and may I   say, not in a shy way;
Oh  no, oh no not me, I did it,      my ……. way.
For what is a man, what has he got, if  not him-self, then he  has  naught,
To say the things, he  truly feels, and not the words, of one who kneels,
The record shows, I  took the blows and did it,   my … way.

I'm as restless as a willow in a wind storm
I'm as jumpy as puppet on a string
I'd say that I had   spring fever
But I know it isn't  spring
I am starry eyed and vaguely discontented
Like a nightingale without a song to sing
O  why should I have  spring fever
When it isn't even spring
I keep wishing I were somewhere else
Walking down a strange new street
And hearing words that I've never heard
From a girl I've yet to meet
I'm as busy as spider spinning day dreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I  haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud
Or a robin on the wing
But I feel so gay in a melancholy way
That it might as well be   spring
It  might as   well be Spring
I'm as busy as spider spinning day dreams
I'm as giddy as a baby on a swing
I  haven't seen a crocus or a rosebud
Or a robin on the wing

It might as   well be Spring

Brush off the clouds and cheer up, put on a happy face.
Take off that gloomy mask of tragedy     it's not your style
You'll look so good that you'll be glad, you decided, to smile
Pick out a pleasant outlook, stick out that noble chin;
Wipe off that full of doubt look, slap on a happy grin.

Gray skies are gonna clear up, put on a happy face;
Brush off the clouds and cheer up, put on a happy face.

Think about banana splits and licorice, and you’ll feel fine.

In red, pink and white
Can't held but believe
That nothing evil can assail ya
So naïve

Of the moss covered trees
Whose tops met yo make on high ceiling
In the church-like pomp
Of the cypress swamp

And find that blossom fair
I always dream of
'Cause with you who could be a failure?

Put her hand in mine      and said she loved me so;

Once upon a hill     we sat beneath a willow tree
Counting all the stars    and waiting for the dawn —
But that was once upon a time   —   now the tree is gone.
How  the breeze    ruffled through her hair;
How we always laughed as though tomorrow wasn't there.
We were young and didn't have a care  —  
Where     did it go?
Once upon a time     the world was sweeter than we knew,
Ev'rything was ours  —  how happy we were then!
But somehow once upon a time
Never comes a - gain.

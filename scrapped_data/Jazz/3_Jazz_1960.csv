0,Misty (ver 3),Ella Fitzgerald,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ella-fitzgerald/misty-chords-2935499,"Look at me, I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree;
And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, just holding your hand
Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty, the moment you're near
Can't you see that you're leading me on?
And it's just what I want you to do
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost
That's why I'm following you
On                 my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love
And too much
In love

1,Fly Me To The Moon,Tony Bennett,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tony-bennett/fly-me-to-the-moon-chords-2772538,"Poets often use many words           to say a simple thing
It takes thought and time and rhyme     to make a poem sing
With music and words I've been playing
For you I have written a song
To be sure that you'll know what I'm saying
I'll translate as I go along
Fly me to the moon, and let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars
In other words,    hold my hand.
In other words,    baby kiss me.
Fill my heart with song, and let me sing forever more
You're all that I long for, all I worship and do adore.
In other words,     please be true!
In other words,    I love you!

When day is done and the sun starts to set in Granada
I envy the blush of the snow-clad Sierra Nevada

A summer place
Where it may rain or storm,
Yet, I'm safe and warm
For within
That summer place
Your arms reach out to me
And my heart is free from all care
For it knows
There are no gloomy skies,
When seen through the eyes,
Of those who are blessed, with love
And the sweet, secret of
A summer place
Is that it's anywhere,
When two people share,
All their hopes
All their dreams
All their love.

Ah, por que tudo é tão triste?
Ah, a beleza que existe
A beleza que não é só minha
Que também passa sozinha
Ah, se ela soubesse
Que quando ela passa
O mundo sorrindo se enche de graça
E fica mais lindo por causa do amor

Makes me stop before I begin

0,Muddy Water,Madeleine Peyroux,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/madeleine-peyroux/muddy-water-chords-3326909,"Dixie moonlight, Swanee shore
Headed homebound just once more
To my Mississippi delta home
Southland got that grand garden spot
Although you believe or not
I hear those trees a-whispering
""Come on back to me""
Muddy water 'round my feet
Muddy water in the street
No God don't shelter
Down on the delta
Muddy water in my shoes
Reeling and rocking to them lowdown blues
They live in ease and comfort down there
I do declare
Been away a year today
To wander and roam
I don't care it's muddy there
But this is my home
Got my toes turned Dixie way
'Round the delta let me lay
My heart cries out for muddy water

1,Was I Drunk,Madeleine Peyroux,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/madeleine-peyroux/was-i-drunk-chords-1218989,"Sweet young thing of sixteen
Thought I'd step out one night
I longed to get the thrill in life i've missed
I met a youth 
A little bit uncouth
Although he seemed alright
I knew him by the moment when we kissed
Then I got home, next day with a swollen head
My girlfriend asked if i'd had fun I said,
""was I drunk? was he handsome?
Did momma give me hell?
Did I get a thrill? Am I full of quiver?
Was he rough? Did I care?
Am I glad I fell?
Every time I think of him, do I shiver?
Was he hot? And was I?
And would he stand for maybe?
He would not? Did I lie?
Does he still think i'm a baby?
If I was, am I still?
Do I care? No, Don't be silly
Was I drunk? Was he handsome?
And did momma give me hell?

   Bringing old memories that I had locked away

   Are put back together again

Love makes us cry
We're up and we're down
We don't understand why
But we take it
We're just trying to make it
Sometimes we lose touch
With our feelings inside
Put up our walls
When we injure our pride
And we break up
Only to make up
Easy
Love has never been easy
And I've been searching
'Til I finally found what I was looking for
And it takes what it takes
We all make mistakes
There are so many Mountains to climb
But I know that our love will survive
Baby this time
We heal from the pain
We learn from the past
The future is ours
Now we found it at last
We both know it - babe
Can't help but show it

Love has never been easy, Baby
And I've been searching
'Til I finally found what I was looking for
And it takes what it takes

There are so many Mountains to climb
But I know that our love will survive

There were so many times
When the road got rough
I thought that we'd both had enough
But we kept it alive
Somehow the love wouldn't diiiiiiie - Love wouldn't die

There are so many Mountains to climb

Half  a  love never appealed to me.
If your heart never could yield to me,
Then I'd rather have nothing  at  all.
All    or nothing at all --
If it's love,  there is no in-between.
Why begin, then cry for something that might have been?
No, I'd rather have nothing at all.
But please, don't bring your lips 
So close to my cheek;
Don't smile or I'll be lost beyond recall.
The kiss in your eyes, 
The touch of your hand makes me weak,
And my heart may grow dizzy and fall.
And if I fell    under the spell of your call,
I would be caught in the un - der - tow;
So, you see, I've got to say no.
No,    all           or nothing at all.

Oh his eyes were tender, Oh his arms were warm
and he could smile away the thunder, kiss away the rain
and even though he’s gone a way  you wont hear me complaint
There was a man in Portland, before the winter chill
Oh we used to go courting along the october hills

There's room for all of the loved & lost
Now there aint no room for the hopeless sinner
Whos hard on man-kind just to save his own
Have pi-ty  on  those whose chances are thinner
'Cause there's no hiding place
from the Kingdom's Throne, ohhh...
Peo-ple  get  rea-dy there's a train a-comin'
U dont need no baggage U just get_on  board
All U need is faith to hear diesels a-hummin'
U don't need no ticket U just thank The LORD,
I'm getting ready
I........'m ready....
Lord, Im getting ready
I'm ready

We all gather at the harlem strut
And what we do is tut tut tut
Ol' hannah brown, from way cross town
Keeps drinking her liquor and she brings them down
Just at the break of day
You could hear old hannah say
I wanna pigfoot and a bottle of beer
Send me daddy, cos I don't care
I feel just like I wanna clown
Give the piano player a drink
Cause he brought me down
He's got the rhythm when he stomps his feet
He just send me right off to sleep

In silence on my lonely room

0,Just The Two Of Us,Grover Washington Jr.,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/grover-washington-jr-/just-the-two-of-us-chords-663141,"I see the crystal raindrops fall,
 and the beauty of it all
 Is when the sun comes shining through
To make those rainbows in my mind,
When I think of you sometime,
And I want to spend some time with you.
Just the two of us,    we can make it if we try,
Just the two of us,    just the two of us.
Just the two of us,  building castles in the sky,
Just the two of us,   you and I.
We look for love, no time for tears,
wasted water's all that is,
And it don't make no flowers grow.
Good things might come to those who wait,
But not for those who wait too late
We've got to go for all we know.
Just the two of us,    we can make it if we try,
Just the two of us,    just the two of us.
Just the two of us,  building castles in the sky,
Just the two of us,   you and I.
I hear the crystal raindrops fall on the window down the hall
And it becomes the morning dew.
And Darling, when the morning comes And I see the morning sun,
I want to be the one with you.
Just the two of us,    we can make it if we try,
Just the two of us,    just the two of us.
Just the two of us,  building big castles way on high,
Just the two of us,   you and I.

You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry, be happy.
In every life we have some trouble
But when you worry you make it double
Don't worry, be happy.
Don't worry, be happy now.
Don't worry, be happy. Don't worry, be happy.
Don't worry, be happy. Don't worry, be happy.
Ain't got no place to lay your head
Somebody came and took your bed
Don't worry, be happy.
The landlord say your rent is late
He may have to litigate
Don't worry, be happy.
Look at me -- I'm happy.
Don't worry, be happy.
Here I give you my phone number. When you worry, call me,
Don't worry, be happy.
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style
Ain't got no gal to make you smile
Don't worry, be happy.
'Cause when you worry your face will frown
And that will bring everybody down
Don't worry, be happy.
Don't worry, be happy now.
Don't worry, be happy. Don't worry, be happy.
Don't worry, be happy. Don't worry, be happy.
Don't worry, don't worry, don't do it.
Be happy. Put a smile on your face.
Don't bring everybody down.
Don't worry. It will soon pass, whatever it is.
Don't worry, be happy.                                
   I'm not worried, I'm happy...

The days would all be empty

And we've often rewound the clock
Since the Puritans got a shock
When they landed on Plymouth Rock.
If today, any shock they should try to stem
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock,
Plymouth Rock would land on them.
In olden days, a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking.
But now, God knows,
Anything goes.
Good authors too who once knew better words
Now only use four-letter words
writing prose.
Anything goes.
If driving fast cars you like, if low bars you like,
If old hymns you like, if bare limbs you like,
If Mae West you like, or me undressed you like,
Why, nobody will oppose.
When ev'ry night the set that's smart is in-
truding in nudist parties
in studios.
Anything goes.
When Missus Ned McLean (God bless her)
Can get Russian reds to ""yes"" her,
Then I suppose
Anything goes.
When Rockefeller still can hoard en-
Ough money to let Max Gordon
Produce his shows,
Anything goes.
The world has gone mad today, and good's bad today,
And black's white today, and day's night today,
And that gent today, you gave a cent today
Once had several chateaux.
When folks who still can ride in Jitneys
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys
Lack baby clo'es,
Anything goes.
When Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction
Instruct Anna Sten in diction,
Then Anna shows
Anything goes.
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up
Now does a handspring landing up-
On her toes,
Anything goes.
Just think of those shocks you've got, and those knocks you've got
And those blues you've got, from those news you've got
And those pains you've got, (If any brains you've got)
From those little radios.
So Missus R, with all her trimmin's,
Can broadcast a bed from Simmons
'Cause Franklin knows
Anything goes.

Gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree
I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see
And be what I want to be
When I think more than I want to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more that I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you
   Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
Listen to me, I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she coming to me nearly here?
Lilac wine is sweet and heady where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love?
Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
Isn't that she, or am I just going crazy, dear?
Lilac wine, I feel unready for my love
Feel unready for my love

e sono solo quassù in città,
Sento fischiare sopra I tetti
Un aereoplano che se ne va

Mi accorgo
Di non avere più risorse
Senza di te,

Io quasi quasi prendo il treno
E vengo, vengo da te,

Sembra quandero all'oratorio
Con tanto sole, tanti anni fa
Quelle domeniche da solo
In un cortile a passeggiar
Ora mi annoio più di allora
Neanche un prete per chiacchierar

Tra l'oleandro e il baobab,
Come facevo da bambino,
Ma qui c'è gente, non si può più
Stanno innaffiando le tue rose,
Non c'è il leone, chissà dov'è

Instead of getting 'em off my chest, 
To let 'em rest unexpressed, 
I hate parading my   serenading 
As I'll probably miss a bar, 
But if this ditty is not so pretty 
At least it'll tell you how great you are. 
  You're the top!  You're the Coliseum.
  You're the top!  You're the Louvre Museum. 
  You're a melody from a symphony by Strauss 
You're a Bendel bonnet, a Shakespeare sonnet, you're Mickey Mouse.

  You're the smile  on the Mona Lisa

They'll take us where we want to go

Is a hundred-proof

Hangs in this L.A. sky
The blankets they give the Indians
Only make them die

Forgotten for so long
And let the music flow
Like light into the rainbow
We know the dance, we have
We still have the chance
To break these chains and flow

Is the child of pain
And lost in La Califusa
When most of my hope was gone
Antonio's samba led me
To the Amazon

And let the music flow
Like light into the rainbow

   il musicista si diverte e si estenua
   E mi avrai verde milonga che sei stata scritta per me,
   per la mia senbilità, per le mie scarpe lucidate
   Per il mio tempo, per il mio gusto
   per tutta la mia stanchezza e la mia mia guittezza.
  Mi avrai verde milonga inquieta
  che mi strappi un sorriso di tregua ad ogni accordo,
  mentre, mentre fai dannare le mie dita
  Io sono qui, sono venuto a suonare
  sono venuto ad amare e di nascosto a danzare
  E ammesso che la milonga
  fosse una canzone, ebbene io
  io l'ho svegliata e l'ho guidata a un ritmo più lento
  Così la milonga rivelava di sè
  molto più, molto più di quanto apparisse
  La sua origine d'Africa, la sua eleganza di zebra,
  il suo essere di frontiera, una verde frontiera
  Una verde frontiera tra il suonare e l'amare,
   verde spettacolo in corsa da inseguire
   Da inseguire sempre, da inseguire ancora,
   fino ai laghi bianchi del silenzio
   Finchè Ataualpa o qualche altro Dio
   non ti dica: descansate niño, che continuo io
Ah... Io sono qui, sono venuto a suonare,
sono venuto a danzare e di nascosto ad amare

The things I gave away
And when I'm in a certain mood
I search the house and look
One night I found these magic words
In a magic book
Throw it away
Throw it away
Give your love, live your life
Each and every day
And keep your hand wide open
Let the sun shine through
'Cause you can never lose a thing
If it belongs to you
There's a hand to rock the cradle
And a hand to help us stand
With a gentle kind of motion
As it moves across the land
And the hand's unclenched and open
Gifts of life and love it brings
So keep your hand wide open
If you're needing anything
Throw it away
Throw it away
Give your love, live your life
Each and every day
And keep your hand wide open
Let the sun shine through
'Cause you can never lose a thing
If it belongs to you
Throw it away
Throw it away
Give your love, live your life
Each and every day
And keep your hand wide open
Let the sun shine through

His ol' man's in a bottle
He done quit his 9 to 5 he drink full time
So now he's livin' in the bottle
See that black boy over there, runnin' scared
His ol' man got a problem and it's a bad one
Pawned off damn near everything, his ol'
Woman's weddin' ring for a bottle
And don't you think it's a crime
When time after time, people in the bottle
See that sista, sho wuz fine before she
Started drinkin' wine
From the bottle
Said her ol' man committed a crime
And he's doin' time
So now she's in the bottle
She's out there on the avenue, all by herself
Sho' needs help from the bottle
Preacherman tried to help her out
She cussed him out and hit him in the head with a bottle
And don't you think it's a crime
When time after time, people in the bottle
See that gent in the wrinkled suit
To the bottle
He wuz a doctor helpin' young girls along
If they wuzn't too far gone to have problems
But defenders of the dollar eagle
Said ""What you doin', Doc, it ain't legal,""
And now he's in the bottle
Now we watch him everyday tryin' to
Chase the pigeons away
From the bottle
And don't you think it's a crime
When time after time, people in the bottle

The bright blessed days, the dark sacred nights,
And I think to myself,  what a wonderful world
The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky,
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
They’re really saying I  love you.
I hear babies crying, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know,
And I think to myself,  what a wonderful world

Only one thing stops you dear:
You're too good; Way too good!
If you want a future, darlin',
Why don't you get a past?
'Cause that fatal moment's comin' at last...
We're all alone, no chaperone
Can get our number
The world's in slumber--let's misbehave
  There's something wild about you child
That's so contagious
  Let's be outrageous--let's misbehave
When Adam won Eve's hand
He wouldn't stand for teasin'.
  He didn't care about those apples out of season.
to little lovebirds
  We're not above birds--let's misbehave
My poor heart aches on
Why keep the breaks on? Let's misbehave
  I feel quite sure un peu d'amour
Would be attractive
  While we're still active, let's misbehave!
You know my heart is true
And you say you for me care
  Somebody's sure to tell, but what the heck do we care?
And even camels
  We're merely mammals--let's misbehave
If you'd be just so sweet
And only meet your fate, dear,

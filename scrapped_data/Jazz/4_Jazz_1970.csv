0,Élégie À Un Rat De Cave,Georges Brassens,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/1727637,"Personne n'aurait cru ce cave
Prophétisant que par malheur
Mon pauvre petit rat de cave
Tu débarquerais avant l'heure
Tu n'étais pas du genre qui vire
De bord et tous on le savait
Du genre à quitter le navire
Et tu es la première qui l'aies fait
Maintenant ma mie qu'on te séquestre, au sein des cieux
Que je me déguise en chanteur d'orchestre, pour tes beaux yeux
En partant ma mie je te l'assure, tu as fichu le noir au fond de nous
Quoiqu'on n'ait pas mis de crêpe sur nos putains de binious
On ne m'a jamais vu, faut que tu le notes, c'est une primeur
Faire un boeuf avec des croque-notes, c'est en ton honneur
Sache aussi qu'en écoutant Bechet, folle gamberge, on voit la nuit tombée
Ton fantôme qui sautille en cachette, rue du Vieux Colombier
Ton fantôme qui sautille en cachette, rue du Vieux Colombier
Sans aucun ""Au revoir mes frères""
Mais on ne t'en veut pas pour autant
Mine de rien tu es allée faire
Ton trou dans les neiges d'antan
Désormais, c'est pas des salades
Parmi Flora, Jeanne, Thaïs
J'inclus ton nom à la ballade
Des belles dames du temps jadis
Maintenant ma mie qu'ta place est faite chez les gentils
Que tu as retrouvé pour l'éternelle fête, Papa Zutty
Chauffe la place à tous les vieux potaches: machin, chose, et Luther et Longnon
Et ce gras du bide de Moustache, tes fidèles compagnons
S'il est brave, pourquoi que Dieu le père, là-haut ferait
Quelque différence entre Saint-Pierre et Saint-Germain-des-Prés
De tout coeur on espère que dans ce paradis miséricordieux
Brillant pour toi des lendemains qui dansent, où y a pas de bon Dieu
Brillant pour toi des lendemains qui dansent, où y a pas de bon Dieu

Lived a cat named Big Bad Bill,
I want to tell ya,
That cat was tough, and he certainly could strut his stuff
He had the town all scared to death,
When he walked by people held their breath,
He was a fighting man, sure enough,
And then Bill got himself a wife,
Now he leads a different life
Big Bad Bill is sweet William now,
Married life done changed him somehow,
He's the man the town used to fear,
Now they all call him sweet pappa Willie dear,
Stronger than Samson I declare,
Til' a brown skinned woman done bobbed his hair
Big Bad Bill don't fight any more
He's doing the dishes and he mops up the floor
Well he used to spend his night out
Looking for a fight,
Now he gotta see his woman every night,

Sometimes I wonder.  Why I spend the lonely nights,
Dreaming of a song.
   The melody haunts my memory,
  And I am once again with you.
When our love was new,
And each kiss an inspiration.
But that was long ago
 Is in star dust of song.
Beside the garden wall
When stars are bright,
 The nightingale tells his fairy tales,
Of paradise where roses grew.
And though I dream in vain,
In my heart, there always will remain
My stardust melody,
 The memory of loves refrain.

You sure do make it like a sunny day
Sunflower fair warning
I'm gonna love you if you come my way
Now if there's a chance that romance can find you
It better not find you looking the other way
Now isn't it time you finally take it
Make it so real it steals your breath away
Hey hey hey
Sunflower, well good morning
You sure do make it like a sunny time
Sun morning, good morning
And someday, child. I'm gonna make you mine

I don't want to hear another word you have to say
I've been waiting for so long,
I just found out there's something wrong,
Nothing will get better if I stay
There's no need to explain anymore
I tried my best to love you,
Now I'm walkin' out the door
You used me, you've deceived me,
And you never seem to need me
But I'll bet, you won't forget me when I go

Seems I've been lost in a dream,
Pretending that you care
And now I've opened up my eyes,
And found it's all been just a great big fairytale
I've been lovin' you so long,
Don't think I'll even know how to forget you
But now the way that things have been,
I think I'm better off alone,
Than to be with you
You don't love me it's plain to see
There's no need to explain anymore
I tried my best to love you,

You used me, you've deceived me,

Pretending you were mine
Someday you'll open up your eyes
And realize that a good woman's hard to find

Remember what makes you happy                (Woh-oh, woh-oh)
Never give up on a good thing
  If love is what you got,     you've got a     lot
  Money's tight, he's workin' every night, it ain't
Easy to keep the flame a-live
  And when he finally comes home to ya
  He's just too tired to do the things you want to
  You can't help but wonder to yourself
  How would it be… with someone else
  Just keep in mind, every storm ends in time
Love is forever, stay together
(Stay together) When you got something real
(Love forever) That you may never feel    a-gain
Never give up on a good thing
Remember what makes you happy            (Woh-oh, woh-oh)
Never give up on a good thing
  If love is what you got,     you've got a     lot
  Now you're the man, you've got to understand, she don't
Me-ean to make a scene
  Like you, she feels all the weight you're under
  And when she breaks, is it any wonder?
  I know sometimes it crosses your mind
  To get on out and stay hard to find
  Before you try you'd better look in her eye
Love is forever, stay together
(Stay together) You’ve got something real
(Love forever) That you may never feel      a-gain…
(You've got a lot)
(Stay together)
(Love forever)  You’ve got something real
That you may never feel     a-gain…
Never give up on a good thing
Remember what makes you happy             (Oh, woh-oh) 
Never give up on a good thing
  If love is what you got,    you've got a    lot
Don't – give up your good thing
Don't give it up – oh,   no.   Oh-oh woh-oh.
Don't – give up your good thing
Be  strong. Oh don’t, don’t live it up, don’t give it up.
Never give up on a good thing
Remember what makes you happy
(Oh, woh-oh) Never give up on a good thing
  If love is what you got,     you've got a    lot

 I'm tryin' to show how much I love you
Still believin' in romance
 You're taking way too many chances
With    my     love
I   remember when you used to be
The talk of the town, all you'd get is lonely

 Don't you turn me down
 I can show you how
 Turn your love  around
 Without the woman I can make it
But I need the girl to stay
 Oh don't you let the lady take it
All     the    way
When the woman needs a taste of yesterday
And he stays at home, all they get is lonely
 Turn your love around
 Don't you turn me down
 I can show you how
 Turn your love   a (turn your love around)
 Oh girl you know me, I'm alone until you show me, that you're
Still in love with me, we're gonna
Make it, we're gonna
Take it, back where we belong

 Don't you turn me down
 I can show you how
 Turn your love   a (turn your love around)

 Don't you turn me down, every woman needs a man

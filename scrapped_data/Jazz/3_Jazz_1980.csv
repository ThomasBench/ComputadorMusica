Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee.
You get some shoes, a little rice
The groom's so nervous, he answers twice
It's really thrillin' that he's so willin'
For makin' whoopie.
Picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture that same love nest
And see what a year will bring
He's doin' dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious, he even sews
Just don't forget, folks,
That's what you get, folks,
For makin' whoopie.

That when your love wears golden earrings, she belongs to you.
An old love story that's known to very few,
but if your love wears golden earrings, love will come to you.
By the burning fire they will glow with every coal.
You will hear desire wisper low inside your soul.
So be my gypsy, make love to me tonight,
and let this pair of golden earrings cast their spell tonight

And the days of If are gone, 'cause he's showing us how

Brave new answers screaming the truth, And the techno wins the crown

Generating square waves, While computing new games
Finally gets the chip off his back,      A smile is on his face
E-rasing every trace, Of doubt that plagues the rest of the pack
And his brain stores memories, No alterna-tives could come in
He's the living remedy, Times are better than they were then

Now as I wander my thoughts ever stray
South of the border - down Mexico way
She was a picture - in old Spanish lace
And for a tender while I kissed the smile upon her face
For it was Fiesta, we were so gay
South of the border - down Mexico way
And she smiled and she whispered, ""Mañana""
Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied as I whispered, ""Mañana""
For our tomorrow never came
South of the border - I rode back one day
There in a veil of white by candlelight she knelt to pray
And the mission bells told me that I mustn't stay

Than he ran into a problem, he heard the voice inside him say
Do you believe that what you have is what you need
You can't blame Louis,     Oh, Louis
He found a girl, his heart's desire, she was the first, she quenched the thirst
His social whirl, did not inspire, her life divine, soon lost its shine
Now he's counting every hour, wondering where she spent the night
She doesn't show, it seems he'll never know
You can't blame Louis,     Oh, Louis
You can't blame Louis,     Oh, Louis
Take a day and trace a thought to where it all began, remembering how you felt at every turn
Even thought reality was not part of the plan, by reaching out you lit the spark forever
Louis thought he'd find the answer, in a world that has no soul
He moved on, to learn another song

So far away
Out of sight, out of mind
Love has gone, but I will shine

I will take what love I find

Took my life in these two hands
And I know I won't turn around
Though I often see your face
When I'm in a crowded place
It doesn't get me down
I met a girl with smiling eyes
Full of love and worldly wise
She told me she knows what to do
To help me put the memories of you

It's sad to see true lovers part, 'cause sometimes lovers feel a change of heart
Out of sight and out of mind
Well the stranger's words came true, and the prophecy went through, I knew it would change my world

I asked you what was going on, you said that I'd been gone too long

And they try to solve their problems burning up the na-tion

You can try to hide behind a mask of contemplation
Say you want to live your life in private isolation
From the east you can't ignore the storm of disillusion
And so it falls on all our shoulders to find a new solution
          You've got to make a start of it,            you've got to feel a part of it

A young boy tries to concentrate, his mind would rather fly beyond the classroom cage
He can take the teacher's voice, turn it into music from a-nother place
All the other kids don't have that choice, hanging on to every word the teacher says
Day and night - we will be touched, Standing in the light - don't sha-dow the genius
So out of school he walks alone, soon his thoughts are flowing like a golden stream
An empty house he calls his own, this place becomes a temple to a silent dream
Sometimes he will clap and sing, then deep in medi-tation he will learn to be
And only birds upon the wing, with upward fasci-nation claim to be so free
Day and night - we will be touched, Standing in the light - don't sha-dow the genius
     Your smile,    your freedom,    comes to you from within
     Still a child     with a reason,     you're af-raid but it's time to begin
     Blow the wind of  change, though the words are strange -    to hear
     Say what's on your mind, now is not the time - for fear
A summer's day in eight-one, sunlight through a window falls a-cross the page
A young man's fight has just begun, and rising up in-side him is a burning rage
They called his dream a fantasy, a song that every child has sung since time began
But just as long as he believes, standing in the light he'll make them understand                       (Fade)

Standing at the master's side, Then with patience he confides
Secret knowledge, sacred ways, Pearls of wisdom from the dragon days
I could never lie, For honour I would die, Following the Chin-ese way
So many years ago, Heroes ruled the world, They were the only ones in a cruel world
I could never lie, For honour I would die, Following the Chin-ese way
From  the mountains to Pe-king,           Where    the paper lan-terns gently swing
The Chi-nese way, Who knows what they know, The Chinese legend grows
The Chi-nese way, Who knows what they know, The Chinese legend grows
The Chi-nese way, Who knows what they know, The Chinese legend grows
The Chi-nese way, Who knows what they know, The Chinese legend grows   (Fade out)

48,Your Secrets Safe With Me,Michael Franks,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/michael-franks/your-secrets-safe-with-me-chords-971598,"Lost your toy lover boy
In the mirror take a look
You're much older now
You used to be twenty three
Suddenly the summer ends
And you don't know how
It was in this fun hit and run
Sweet talk was your middle name
Always on the prowl
Just one dance no romance
Livin' like an alley cat
And you sure could howl
Your secret's safe with me
You're tired and lonely
The only cure will be love
Your secret's safe with me
Ain't no contender    
You’ve got no fist in your glove 
Your secret's safe with me
You're searching for someone
Who's got no lies to con - ceal
Your secret's safe with me
Waiting for someone
Whose eyes will tell you it's real
Whose eyes will tell you it's real
Whose eyes will tell you it's...
Live and learn wait your turn
Don't you know the deepest love
Comes to those who wait
Why be smart hear your heart
Leading you to someone new
No, it's not too late
Your secret's safe with me (Your secret's safe with me)
Tired and lonely
The only cure will be love
Your secret's safe with me (Your secret's safe with me)
Ain't no contender
You’ve got no fist in your glove
Your secret's safe with me (Your secret's safe with me)
You're searching for someone
Who's got no lies to con - ceal
Your secret's safe with me (Your secret's safe with me)
Waiting for someone
Whose eyes will tell you it's real
(Will tell you it's real...)
Whose eyes will tell you it's real
(Eyes will tell you it's real...)
Whose eyes will tell you it's real
(Eyes will tell you it's real...)
Whose eyes will tell you it's real
(Eyes will tell you it's real...)
    Your secret's safe with me (Your secret's safe with me)
Tired and lonely
The only cure will be love
Your secret's safe with me (Your secret's safe with me)
Ain't no contender
You got no fist in your glove
Your secret's safe with me (Your secret's safe with me)
Searching for someone
Who's got no lies to con - ceal
Your secret's safe with me (Your secret's safe with me)
Waiting for someone
Whose eyes will tell you it's real
Your secret's safe with me (Your secret's safe with me)
Your secret's safe with me (Your secret's safe with me)
Your secret's safe with me (Your secret's safe with me)
Your secret's safe with me (Your secret's safe with me)
Your secret's safe with me (Your secret's safe with me)
Your secret's safe with me (Your secret's safe with me)

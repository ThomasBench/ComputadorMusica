  I would be thankful for a holiday with you
A holiday for two
Just you and I, a starry sky
And nothin' else to do
  My heart is beating for a holiday with you
A holiday, not blue
Would be what I needed now
'Cause happy days are few
Winter isn't easy when you're holding back the tears

  Would you be happy with a holiday in bed
With covers over head?
Your heart is lost, inside a frost
I'll give you mine instead
Winter isn't easy when you're holding back the tears
So give me yours, my dear

Would you like to sit under my tree?

Sometimes life is just that way

Sometimes life is just that way
If the sun comes up, the clouds drift away
Sometimes life is just that way, just that way
It's just that way
Woke up this morning, feeling fine
I know that it's over, but its gonna take some time
Letting go is the price you've gotta pay
Sometimes love is just that way

You'll stand there and you'll know
When comes the danger
Blows that come, you take
For sake of love
You'll stand there and you'll know
When comes the danger
The blows that come, you take
For sake of love
They would ever tell the truth o'oh o'oh
That say that love is complicated
They would ever tеll the truth  o'oh o'oh
That say in love you will have some shame
You'll stand there and you'll know
When comes the danger
The blows that come, you take
For sake of love
But still you climb aboard
This lilting ship
Hold on, or lose your grip
For sake of love

Nine, eight, seven, I'm feeling blue
Seven, six, five, I'm feeling you
four, thirty-two, I wonder
If the feeling's true
Nine, eight, seven, What shall I do?
I'm scared and confused
There's numbers in the music
 Can you feel it too?
I wonder if you feel the things I'm going through
I wonder if you feel for those things too
I wonder if you wonder what number we're counting to
Whatever number makes the whole thing true
Nine, eight, seven, how are you doing?
What is your name, and is it groovy?
Is it Mortimer, is it Susan?
Is that the correct conclusion?
Nine, ten, eleven, into the stars
Up on the stairway through the hall
And you're wondering who you are
 'Cause it's been so long
I wonder if you're wondering how it got this far
I suppose that you'vе been wondering what went wrong
 Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve, it's a counting song
Count down through the numbеrs, then it's done
Two and one, what have you done?
Three and four, please do it more
Five and ten, around the bend
Over and over and under and over and home again
I wonder if that's somewhere that you've ever been
If it's somewhere that you'd ever go again?
    I know that most homes are broken, so you don't come back
But your home was never like that
Nine, eight, seven, I'm feeling blue
Seven, six, five, that's still true
four, thirty-two, I'm nervous
And I don't know what to do (Hupf)
Nine, eight, nothing, where will you go?
When will you leave and how will you know?
Think of a new number and then count up to it real slow
Oh, yes, I feel the things that you've been going through
And I know that each thing you feel is so true
A hundred, I'm still wondering what number we're counting to
Whatever number makes the whole thing blue
 One, one, two
 One, one, three
 One, one, one
 One, one, meef - Meef?

13,Im Scared,Bill Wurtz,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bill-wurtz/im-scared-chords-4137925,"I'm scared!
I'm scared of the world out there
But it's cold in here
Here, there, I'm scared of everywhere
I'm scared!
I'm scared of the clothes I wear
They're too small and too large
And nothing goes my way
I'm scared of my own face
Oh, I'm fallin' (I'm fallin')
Down down, and down down
Keep talkin'
I'm on the ground and I'm walkin'
I'm on my way
It's a strong happy day
And happy times await
And tomorrow I can get scared another day
I'm scared
Of what's there, what's not there
What's goin' on here?
Help me understand, help me formulate a plan
Help me get down from where I've been
I'm fallin'
Down 'round 'round, down 'round 'round
Keep talkin'
I'm underground and I'm crawlin'
I've found my way
Into a new happy place
At a happy time of day
And I'm okay, but I'll get scared anyway
I'm not scared
I'm just a little bit concerned
Overwhelmed about something
-- - Let me explain it slowly, and clearly
Oh, 'cause it's nothing
-- - If I sound confused, that's 'cause it's true
I'm just a little bit going insane about most things
If I sound okay, that's 'cause I'm crazy
And I know you're crazy too
Doo-doo-lu-doo, doo-doo-lu-doo
I love you
No, I don't, yes, I do
Is that true?
Is love just an illusion?
Doo-lu-doo, doo-lu-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
What's the name of this tune?
It's a bad and good tune
And I would sing it to you
But I'm scared
I'm scared of
The things that I love
To be scared of
(Am I scared enough?)
I'm fallin' (Fallin')
Down down, and down down
Keep talkin'
I'm on the ground and I'm walkin'
I'm on my way
It's a strong happy day
And I'm happy times have changed
And tomorrow I'll be scared
And I'm scared away

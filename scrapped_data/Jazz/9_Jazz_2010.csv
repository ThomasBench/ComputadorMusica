She walk like New Orleans, she’s sexy and free
Something in the water's got a hold on me
She's destiny's daughter, I'm gaspin' for air
But you won't believe me, you just had to be there
Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho (Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho)
I'm addicted to the thrill
I can't, I can't let her go
Heaven help me, I'm so helpless
Think I'm losing my control
I'm so deep under her spell, oh well
I don't how she do what she do in the dark
I think she put a root, put a root on my heart
I can't leave her alone, yeah (Oh-whoa)
She read me like them bones, yeah (Oh-whoa)
She, she, she make me go crazy (Crazy)
She make me go crazy (Go crazy)
Oh, she speaks like sweet tea
Her hips sway like the wind through the tree leaves
Her kisses are like coffee-flavored whiskey
I wanna take 'em in 'til I'm tipsy
Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho (Hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-ho)
I'm addicted to the thrill
I can't, I can't let her go

She, she, she make me go crazy (Oh, go crazy)
She make me go crazy (Oh)
She brings me straight to my knees
Her touch is the sweetest indeed
She's making a fool outta me
Bayou Woman, you got me
Howling at the moon, if I don't see you soon
I be crawling to my room after her voodoo
I keep calling, trying to catch you
Getting stuck in her molasses
Or whatever she put in this magic
I don't how she do what she do in the dark
I think she put a root, put a root on my heart
Can't ever leave her alone, yeah (Oh-whoa)
She readin' me like them bones, yeah (Oh-whoa)

1,Half Of You,Peter Cincotti,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/peter-cincotti/half-of-you-chords-2964824,"I wish I knew the reason why
A feeling changes
Wish I knew the reason why
Some don't
Sometimes when I see you now
I start believing
Yours will change again but I know
They won't
So I try to just pretend I'm doing
fine, Without you
Even though I think you know
I'm not.
Truth is that I'm still in love with
Everything about you
But if it's gotta end, it's gotta end
But stop asking me to be your friend
I don't want Half of you
I don't want half of you
don't want a You and I divided by a wall
How can I make it through
with only Half of You
After knowing how it feels to have it all.
Well, I know that going and moving on
Ain't easy
For you or for me
but if you don't wanna get back what is gone,
then leave me
Just walk away, and don't turn around,
but stop looking for a middle ground
I don't want Half of you
I don't want Half of you
I don't want a piece of love I don't know what to call
How can I make it through
with only Half of You
After knowing how it feels to have it all
To have it all.
What's it worth when a world full of colours
splits into shades of grey?
where's the start of the friend and the end of the lover
nobody honest could say
So don't give me Half of You
I don't want Half of You
because the lines we share, I don't know where they fall
I wiah it wasn't true
but when it comes to you
Any less than Everything's too small
Knowing how it feels...
to have it all.

At girls he can't explain
Oh, here she comes
On ten white horses
Made of string and clay
The flowers in his fingers
Wilt away
His wise old lover said
That lies do not deceive
So when she sleeps
I'll leave her bed and
Hurry home instead
My soul is on a string
Tied to her chair
And why is it I pray
To Gods that always fail
To drag that girl back
Through my window
And undress my face
And smile at me
While I put on my chains
Ah Ah Aahhh...

watch what happens when the people catch winds
of water hitting the banks of the hard-dry land

Just trying to find out
Where my place is
I swear I just don't know
Which way that I should go
Sometimes I think
That I just can't stand it
Feels like a dropped in
From another planet
This world has so much madness
Disguised in eyes of sadness
Truth is lost upon the masses
People wear sunglasses
In the dark
Ice is running through their veins
But I ain't taking novocaine
For my heart
Why it gotta be like that?
Why it gotta be?
Why it gotta be like that?
I just can't help but question why
Somebody tell me...
Why it gotta be like that?
Why it gotta be?
Why it gotta be like that?
Some dreams will live and some will die
So many live in mental poverty
While they watch a bad reality
Their spirits going blind
A vacant state of mind
It's time the people opened up their eyes
This revolution will be televised
I've got to find a way
I'm praying every day
Truth is lost upon the masses
People wear sunglasses
In the dark

Until you've faced each dawn with sleep  less eyes,

And it's not what it seems
You're not gonna make it
And it's not meant to be""

But everyone told me I couldn't do it
And I feel real nice 'cause I got lots of money in my bank account
And I walk down the street
People throw things at me
Like breakfast and strength tests (Oh, this is cool)
How much can I bench press?  (Oh, I'm very strong)
Time to win some awards
I'm gonna do everything that you're not supposed to do
I'm gonna open to page 1 and then skip ahead to page 2
'Cause I'm hungry and scared, and I can't find the truth
So I'm leaving, oh, there's my balloon
Over the trees, under the bridge and over the town
I'm gonna tell you the things that I'm feeling out loud
And they changed all the rules, then I wrote them all again
That's how the game begins
Oh, that's how I get home again

Bésame y derrumba los antiguos monumentos
Bésame y desata el carnaval.
Mírame a los ojos y echa luz a las ojeras
Esta lejanía que nos tiene de rival
Dime en un abrazo que la vida fue una espera
Y que ya no tengo que esperar.
Llévame... Llévame en un beso

Bésame que sólo es más que una falsa moneda
Inmediatamente se despierta la ciudad
Bésame que somos los dos últimos que quedan
Escapando de la soledad.
Llévame a volar sobre los pájaros dormidos
Que andando la Copa sueñan con ingenuidad
Bésame y regálame las mieles del olvido
Bésame que quiero recordar.

Us to behave in way you'd
Only hear about,
On whispers,
On your radio.
Happiness allows,
Us to live our lives
Meaningless.
They say love is a boost,
An injection,
The sweetest perfume
But just as we ask,
We are loveless.
   And I'd say
Your eyes are here
But I've seen them
looking everywhere
But I know you're looking at shadows.
Happiness allows,
Movies in the clouds yay
Happiness allows
Us to be frankenstein yay
Happiness allows
Us to live our lives
meaningless.
And its true money
Can buy you love
But thats all just a fancy mixup
And I'd say it dullens the moment.
And if it fails to be amusing
Drift down,
Down to the end.
There is no time
That is darkness.

Only hear about,
On whispers,
On your radio.

0,La Muerte (ver 2),Monsieur Periné,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/1826931,"La nuit se couche tard 
Les fleurs sont encore pâles 
C'est ta présence qui
S ´éloigne 
Comme les petites voiles 
Des bateaux qui font naufrage 
Mes yeux se sont noyés
¡Aaay!
Qué dolor, que me duelen tus besos 
Tu ausencia 
¡Aaay! 
Qué me lleve la muerte con ella 
No quiero vivir 
Si no estás
Saliste un día normal 
Con prisa a trabajar 
Apenas te comiste un
Pan 
No quise preguntar 
Si estabas bien o mal 
O si querías des-cansar
¡Aaay! 
Quelle douleur qui me déchire le ventre 
No quiero
¡Aaay! 
Qué me lleve la muerte con ella 
No quiero vivir 
Si no estás
¡Aaay!
Qué dolor, que me duelen tus besos 
Tu ausencia 
¡Aaay! 
Qué me lleve la muerte con ella 
No quiero vivir 
Si no estás

Ett hopp om mer  en stund att fånga
en annan smak  det andas tungt
Natten är ljus  luften vibrerar
Ung  att vara ung
När hjärtat slår  och blodet dunkar
Fulländad och briljant
naken vid en brant
Att vilja allt och plötsligt våga
Kom med ut ikväll  kom med ut ikväll
  Du har ingenting att förlora
Kom med ut ikväll  kom med ut ikväll
 Du skriver din egen historia
Ung  att vara ung
att veta allt  och ändå inget
Vägarna ligger där  vem vet var dem bär
visst känns det skönt att fantisera
Kom med ut ikväll  kom med ut ikväll
  Du har ingenting att förlora
Kom med ut ikväll  kom ut  kom ut ikväll

Du skriver din egen historia

Paint your palette blue and grey
Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness of my soul
Shadows on the hill
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land
Now I understand what you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They did not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now
Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
And the colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand
Now I understand what you tried to say to me
How you suffered for your sanity
How you tried to set them free
They did not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now
For they could not love you
Still your love was true
How when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night
You took your life, as lovers often do
But I could have told you, Vincent
This world was never meant for one as beautiful as you
Starry, starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless head on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
Like the strangers that you've met
Oh the ragged men in the ragged clothes
And the silver thorn of bloody rose
Lies crushed and broken on the virgin snow

In this room of disconnect
All I need are mannequins and me
Fabric straight from arm to arm
Rescuing my heart from harm
All that I can see speaks of finesse
Radically my fashion dreams
Costumed men and models scream
Fame is nothing more than force duress
Let them comment of my cold behaviour
Beauty has a price that’s paid by greed
Where I am
I will stand alone
I don’t need the money
I do want for much
These two  hands
Never will they mourn
I’d rather you not love me
Before you want too much
Travelling I do forget
Every single last regret
Solitarily there is one quest
To my cause I will devote
All my passion, note for note
To create and fill this emptiness
Freedom that lies underneath
Let it fall and let them breathe
Bodies are not meant to be so bound
I’m the dancer of the dance
Let the socialites in her hands
Let them love me when I’m not around
When they speak their words of my demeanor
I will let them fuel, wipe their fire
Where I am
I will stand alone
I don’t need the money
I do want for much
These two  hands
Never will they mourn
I’d rather you not love me
Before you want too much
Fading as I live in isolation
Information spreads that I have left
Them let it be an education
Those who cherish me will not let them forget
Where I am
I will stand alone
I don’t need the money
I do want for much
These two  hands
Never will they mourn
I’d rather you not love me
Before you want too much

The cover I can’t do
Your heart refuses to tell you the truth
That's why
It’s why you do it

Surrenders every element of you
And you abuse it
So someone you love, you really love

Games, you never seem to tire
Of his games
The make-up starts to drip, this is insane
Another masquerade, where is the shame?
Please forget his name
Hands are ticking on the clock
Too tired for a walk
Your heart is desperately trying to find you
Why? It’s why you do it

What have we come to, when we reach our final days?

Once we were beautiful, once we were loved......
We can surrender,      and that is enough,

36,That Man,Caro Emerald,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/caro-emerald/that-man-chords-1044266,"             I'm in a little bit of trouble 
  And I'm in real   deep 
From the beginning to the end 
He was no more than a friend to me 
  The thought is makin' me hazy 
  I think I better sit  down 
Cause like the sweetest serenade 
Bet he knows he's got it made with me 
 Twisting round on a carousel 
This speeds' too much to stop 
One second I'm thinkin' I'm feeling the lust 
And then I feel a lot 
Ooh That man is like a flame 
And ooh that man plays me like a game 
My only sin is I can't win 
Ooh I wanna love that man 
Ooh that man is on my list 
And ooh that man I wanna kiss 
My only sin is I can't win 
Ooh I wanna love that man 
             Now it's like I'm on a mission 
 Headed every - where 
And if it takes a little long 
And it feels a little wrong who    cares? 
 My baby fits the description 
 And does it easi - ly 
A little Gable, some Astaire 
When he dances I can hardly    breathe 
 Someone call a doctor 
Need some help to rescue me 
One second I'm thinkin' I must be lost 
And he keeps on findin' me 
(Pip  pap    padap pa...)
      Ooh, I'm gonna find that man 
      You bet ya, I'm gonna find that man 
      Ooh, I'm gonna find that man 
      I'm gonna find that, I'm gonna find that man
     Ciao! Ciao!

“There's no sun-shine in  store”? 
All through the winter you hung a  -  round
Now I be-gin to feel homeward bound 
Blackbird   black-bird gotta be on     my    way
Where there's sunshine galore. 
Pack up all my care and woe, Here I go     singing low  
Bye bye black-bird 
Where somebody waits for me,  Sugar's sweet so is she
Bye  bye blackbird
No one here can love or under-stand me
Oh what hard luck stories they all hand me
Make my bed and light the light, I'll     a-rrive late tonight
Blackbird   bye bye.

I'm like a flower that's fa – ding here 
Where ev'ry hour is one long tear

Is making a blueberry pie
I can hear the clock inside
A-ticking and a-tocking
Everything is peacefully dandy
I can see your granny
'Cross the street still a rocking
Watching all the neighbors go by, oh
Memphis in June
With sweet oleander
Blowing perfume in the air
Up jumps a moon
To make that much grander
It's paradise, brother
Take my advice
Nothing's half as nice
As Memphis in June

0,Little Ole Wine Drinker Me,Dean Martin,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/dean-martin/little-ole-wine-drinker-me-chords-77163,"I'm praying for rain in California
So the grapes willl grow and they can make more wine
And I'm sitting in a honkey in Chicago
With a broken heart and a woman on my mind
I matched the man behind the bar for the jukebox
And the music takes me back to Tennessee
And they ask who's the fool in the corner crying
I say       a little old wine drinker me
I came here last week from down in Nashville
'Cos my baby left for Florida on a train
I thought I'd get a job and just forget her
But in Chicago a broken heart is still the same
I matched the man behind the bar for the jukebox
And the music takes me back to Tennessee
When they ask who's the fool in the corner crying
I say       a little old wine drinker me
I say       a little old wine drinker me

from the brim to the dregs

And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine
To live it again is past all endeavor
Except when that tune clutches my heart
And there we are swearing to love forever
And promising never, never to part
What moments divine, what rapture serene
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted
I know but too well what they mean
So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember
Let it sleep like a dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine

Till the stars that were there before remain above you
Till you whisper to me once more, ""Darling, I love you""

I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way
Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all, and I stood tall
And did it my way
I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
To think I did all that
And may I say, not in a shy way
Oh no, oh no, not me
I did it my way
For what is a man, what has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
Yes, it was my way

Somehow I made it through the heartache

I found my way out of the darkness

When the mountain was high, I still believed
When the valley was low, it didn't stop me, no no

Every  heart would have a new song to sing,
And we'd sing of the joy every morning would bring.
If I ruled the world, every man would be as free as a  bird,
Every  voice would be a voice to be heard
Take my word, we would treasure each day that occ-urred.
My world,  would be a beautyful place,
Where we would weave such wonderful dreams;
My world, would wear a smile on its face,
Like the man, in the moon has, when the moon be-ams. 
If  I   ruled the world, every man would say the world was his friend,
There'd be  hap-pi-ness that no man could end;
No, my friend, not if I, ruled  the world.
Every head would be held up high, there’d be sunshine in eve-ry-one's sky,
If the day ev-er  dawned when I, ru–uled,  the,  wo-or - or- rld.

Oh what a fantasy
Though the idol of my heart
Can't be ordered a la carte
I wonder if she will be
Always a fantasy
Will I ever find the girl on my mind,
The one who is my ideal?
Maybe she's a dream, and yet she might be
Just around the corner waiting for me.
Will I recognize the light in her eyes that no other eyes reveal,
Or will I pass her by and never even know
That she is my  i - deal?

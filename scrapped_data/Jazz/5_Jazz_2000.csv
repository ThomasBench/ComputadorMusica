0,Still (ver 2),Elvis Costello,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/elvis-costello/still-chords-1422021,"These few lines I'll devote
To a marvelous girl covered up in my coat
Pull it  up to your chin
I'll hold you until the day will begin
Still
Lying in the shadows this new flame will cast
Upon everything we've carried from the past
You were made of every love and each regret
Up until the day we met
There are no words that I'm afraid to hear
Unless they are “Goodbye, my dear”
Still
I was moving very fast
But in one place
Now you speak my name and set my pulse to race
Sometimes words may tumble out but can't eclipse
The feeling when you press your fingers to my lips
I want to kiss you in a rush
And whisper things to make you blush
You say “Darling hush 
Hush
“Still,     still”

Why you so upset?
When baby you weren't there
And I was think of you when I came
What do you expect
You left me here alone
I drank so much, Needed to touch
Don't overreact
I pretended he was you
Cause you wouldn't want me to be lonely
How can I put it so you'll understand
I didn't let him hold my hand

Yes he looked you

No he wasn't you

Its not cheating

He looked like you

Yankee's hat upon my head and your voice in my ear
As I talked about the future and all the things we'd do
I never thought your lovin' words would frighten me from you
I remember when I sold my car to board that train
You said you were sure that I would not come back again
And now you see with your own eyes and start to realize
I'm not the man I thought I was so try to sympathize
The way you think about your life
Is gonna change, change tonight
Don't even try out that frown
'Cuz your man is back in town
I'm sure you've been thinkin' 'bout just where the hell I've been?
Painted your own pictures of the trouble I got in
There were times I will admit my heart saw better days
But I'm the type that has to lose to find I had it made
No use talkin' too much about things we cannot change
I know you think it's crazy but I'm here to set things straight
I'm standing here to say that I'll give love a try
It's my complicated way to say I'll simplify
The way you think about your life
Is gonna change, change tonight
Don't even try out that frown
'Cuz your man is back in town
Baby, it's cool to take your time
I was a fool out of my mind
So let's jump off of this merry-go-round
'Cuz your man is back in town
I was drawn away, now I'm back to stay
I was wrong to think there was a better way
Now I see with my own eyes, 'bout time I realize
I hope in time you will forgive, I'll never leave your side
The way you think about your life
Is gonna change, change tonight
Don't even try out that frown
'Cuz your man is back in town
Baby, it's cool to take your time

It's dark, I cannot see
Why does this rain pour down on me
I'm gonna drown
In a sea
Of deep confusion
Somebody told me, I don't know who
Whenever you are sad and blue
And you're feelin' all alone and left behind
Just take a look inside you and you'll find
You gotta hold on, hold on through the night
Hang on, things will be all right
Even when it's dark
And not a bit of sparkling
Sing-song sunshine from above
Spreading rays of sunny love
Just hang on, hang on to the vine
Stay on, soon you'll be divine
If you start to cry, look up to the sky
Something's coming up ahead
To turn your tears to dew instead
And so I hold on to his advice
When change is hard and not so nice
If you listen to your heart the whole night through
Your sunny someday will come one day soon to you
Just hang on

Bursting with  all of the weight of a million rhymes

To wipe away the haze

And no one will pick up the phone,

Oh I can't lie I been keeping score,
And it's your turn to wring me out,

Of all the flowers you plucked if finally
you knew the reason.

Now the fall is here again 
You can't begin to give in, it's all over.

0,Humble Me,Norah Jones,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/norah-jones/humble-me-chords-960939,"Went out on a limb
Gone too far 
I broke down at the side of the road
Stranded at the outskirts and sun's creepin' up
Baby's in the backseat
Still fast asleep
Dreamin' of better days
I don't want to call you but you're all I have to turn to
What do you say
When it's all gone away ?
Baby I didn't mean to hurt you
Truth spoke in whispers will tear you apart
No matter how hard you resist it
It never rains when you want it to
You humble me Lord
You humble me Lord
I'm on my knees empty 
You humble me Lord
You humble me Lord
so please, please, please forgive me
Baby Teresa she's got your eyes 
I see you all the time
When she asks about her daddy
I never know what to say
Heard you kicked the bottle
And helped to build the church
You carry an honest wage 
Is it true you have somebody keeping you company ?
What do you say
When it's all gone away ?
Baby I didn't mean to hurt you
Truth spoke in whispers will tear you apart
No matter how hard you resist it
It never rains when you want it to
You humble me Lord
You humble me Lord
I'm on my knees empty 
You humble me Lord
You humble me Lord
so please, please, please forgive me

1,In The Morning,Norah Jones,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/norah-jones/in-the-morning-chords-2320943,"I can't stop myself from calling
Calling out your name
I can't stop myself from falling
Falling back again
In the morning
Baby, in the afternoon
Dark like the shady corners
Inside a violin
Hot like to burn my lips
I know I can't win
In the morning
Baby, in the afternoon
I tried to quit you but I'm too weak
Waking up without you
I can hardly speak at all
Girlfriend tried to help me
Get you off my mind
She tried a little tea and sympathy
To get me to unwind
In the morning
Baby, in the afternoon
Funny how my favorite shirt
Smells more like you than me
Bitter traces left behind
In stains that no one can see
In the morning
Baby, in the afternoon
You're gonna put me in an early grave
I know I'm your slave whenever you call
I can't stop myself from calling
Calling out your name
I can stop myself from falling
Falling back again
Falling back again....

  Who'll be loving you   by candlelight

  Don't wait too long

  Time can slip    away

  Before you find your way
  Take a chance, play your part
  Make romance, it might break your heart

 I watched the whole thing fall
 And I never saw the writing that was on the wall
 If I only knew
 Days were slipping past
 That the good things never last
 That you were crying 
 Summer turned to winter
 And the snow it turned to rain
 And the rain turned into tears upon your face

 And god I hope it's not too late                      
 It's not too late
 'Cause you are not alone
 I'm always there with you
 And we'll get lost together
 Till the light comes pouring through
 'Cause when you feel like you're done
 And the darkness has won
 Babe, you're not lost
 When your worlds crashing down
 And you can't bear the thought
 I said, babe, you're not lost
 Life can show no mercy
 It can tear your soul apart
 It can make you feel like you've gone crazy But you're not
Things have seem to changed
 There's one thing that's still the same
 In my heart you have remained
And we can fly   fly  fly   a-way...
 'Cause you are not alone
 I'm always there with you
 And we'll get lost together
 Till the light comes pouring through
 'Cause when you feel like you're done
 And the darkness has won

Rockin' your F me pumps

With your Gucci bag crew
Can't tell who he's lookin' to
Cuz you all look the same
Everyone knows your name
And that's your whole claim to fame
Never miss a night
Cuz your dream in life
Is to be a footballer's wife

If you got past one night
But that part never goes right
In the morning you're vexed
He's onto the next
And you didn't even get no text
Don't be too upset
If they call you a sket

Cuz you got there for free
But somehow you missed the plane
You did too much E
Met somebody
And spent the night getting caned
Without girls like you
There'd be no fun
We'd go to the club and not see anyone
Without girls like you
There's no nightlife

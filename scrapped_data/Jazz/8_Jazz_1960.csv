0,Telegram För Fullmånen (ver 2),Cornelis Vreeswijk,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/3828827,"Fullmånen, jag undrar, vad lyser den för?
Nån mening ska det väl vara
Den hänger i luften bara
Men inte för att den stör,
men inte gör den mig glad
sa Ann-Katrin Rosen blad
För tänker man efter så är det ett lik,
som lyser på oss om natten
Där finns varken luft eller vatten
Visst speglas den i vår vik,
men den ligger på lit de parade,
sa Ann-Katrin Rosenblad
Du håller min hand, sa Ann-Katarin
Berätta varför du gör det
Tror du att du får nånting för det?
Nej, karlar är ena svin
som svamlar om kärleksglöd
Men månen är kall och död

You know I'll soon discover
One day by and by
That you loved another
No matter what you say
I'm going to leave you right away
So now, baby, baby, don't you cry
You know you can't deny
I did my best to please you
But you were so unkind
But still I try to need you
True love that was sincere
You didn't really care
So now, baby, baby, don't you cry
And I remember, sweetheart, that it was you, and not I
Who said that we must part
And the time has come to say goodbye
So why do you cry, sweetheart
Hey, hey, baby, don't you cry
Because the end is nearing
You ought to be satisfied
You know I'm going to keep on caring
Why should you feel blue
I'll tell you, I'm going to be the one to lose

9,Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most,Ella Fitzgerald,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ella-fitzgerald/spring-can-really-hang-you-up-the-most-chords-3124508,"Once I was a sentimental thing,
Threw my heart away each spring,
Now a spring romance   hasn't got a chance
Promised my first dance to winter,
All I've got to show’s a splinter
for my little fling!
Spring this year has got me feeling
like a horse that never left the post,
I     lie in my room staring up at the ceiling,
Spring can really hang you up the most!
Morning’s kiss wakes trees and flowers,
And to them I'd like to drink a toast,
I     walk in the park just to kill lonely hours,
Spring can really hang you up the most!
All afternoon those birds twitter twit,
I know the tune, ""this is love, this is it!""
Heard it before and I know the score,
And I've decided that spring is a bore!
Love seemed sure a ‘round the new year,
Now it's April, love is just a ghost,
Spring arrived on time, only what became of you, dear?
Spring can really hang you up the most!
Spring can really hang you up the most!
Spring is here, there’s no      mistaking
Robins building nests from coast to coast;
My heart tries to sing so they won’t hear it breaking,
Spring can really hang you up the most!
College boys are writing sonnets,
In the tender passion they're engrossed,
But I'm on the shelf with last years Easter bonnets,
Spring can really hang you up the most!
Love came my way, I hope it would last,
We had our day, now that's all in the past!
Spring came along a season of sun,
Full of sweet   promise but something went wrong!
Doctors once prescribed a tonic,
""sulfur and molasses"" was the dose,
Didn't help a bit, my condition must be chronic,
Spring can really hang you up the most!
All alone, the party's over,
Old man winter was a gracious host,
But when you keep praying for snow to hide the clover
Spring can really hang you up the most!

The belfries of all Christendom
Had rung so long the unbroken song
Of peace on earth good will to men (Peace on Earth good will to men)
And in despair I bowed my head
There is no peace on earth I said
For hate is strong and mocks the song
Of peace on earth good will to men (Good will to men)
Then peel the bells more loud and deep
God is not dead nor does he sleep
The wrong shall fail the right prevail
With peace on earth good will to men
Good will to men

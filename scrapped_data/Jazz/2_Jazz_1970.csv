0,The Last Chance Texaco,Rickie Lee Jones,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/rickie-lee-jones/the-last-chance-texaco-chords-1403361,"-----
  A long stretch of headlights bends into I-9
  Tiptoe into truckstops
  And sleepy diesel eyes
  Volcanoes rumble in the taxi and glow in the dark
  Camels in the driver's seat
  A slow easy mark
     But you ran outta gas down the road a piece
     And then the battery went dead
     Now the cable won't reach      It's your
  Last chance to check under the hood  Your
  Last  chance  she  ain't sounding too good   It's your
  Your last chance to trust the man with the
  Star
  You've found the last chance
  Texaco                    The last chance
  Well, he tried to be Standard  He tries to be Mobil
  He tried living in a world     And in a shell
  There was this block-busted blonde
  He loved her - free parts and labor
  But she broke down and died
  And threw all the rods he gave her
But this one ain't fuel-injected
Her plug's disconnected
She gets scared and she stalls
She just needs a man, that's all
It's her last chance
Her timing's all wrong
Her last chance
She can't idle this long
Her last chance
Turn her over and go
Pullin' out of the last chance texaco
The last chance

Night the lonely interlude just came, then blew away
You know girl, everything was come what may until you fell in my life

I'll --- remember you too clearly
 But I'll survive another day
Conversations to share
When there's no one there
I'll imagine what you'd say
I'll see you in another life now, baby
I'll free you in my dreams
   But when I reach across the galaxy
   I will miss your company
Company  I'll be
looking for company   Look and listen
Through the years
Someday you may hear me
Still crying, Still crying,crying for company
Still crying, for company
So now you're going off to live your life
You say we'll meet each other now and then
But we'll never be the same
And I know I'll never have this chance again
No, not like you  No, not like you
So, I'll see you in another life                now baby
  I'll free you in my dreams
But when I reach across the galaxy
   I will miss your company
Company  I'll be

Someday you may hear me
Still crying, Still crying, crying for company
Still crying, for company

A wounded heart will heal
But never much too soon
Yes, every-thing must change

Somewhere over there
All confined to barracks
'Twas more than I could bear
I knew you were waiting in the street
I heard your feet
But could not meet
My Lili of the lamplight
My own Lili Marlene
Resting in our billet
Just behind the line
Even though we're parted
Your lips are close to mine
You wait where that lantern softly gleamed
Your sweet face seems
To haunt my dreams
My Lili of the lamplight
My own Lili Marlene
My Lili of the lamplight
My own Lili Marlene

My poor heart yearns for you both night and day
Since you're gone the stars don't seem to shine
You are always on my mind
I'm so unhappy for I want just you
But there'll come a time
You'll miss me and you'll be blue
There'll come a time
You'll want me no one else will do (sweet Mamma)

I gave all my love to you
I never dreamed that you could be untrue
You have ways of loving all your own
That's what made me leave my happy home

On his dreams like boats we knew
He would sail in time

My sisters all grew up and went away
  To Denver and Cheyenne
Marrying their grownup dreams
The lilacs and the man
I stayed behind the youngest still
And I danced alone
Hoping that my father's dreams
Would someday take me home
Take me home
And I live in Paris now
  My children dance and sing
Word’s of a miner's tongue
A language they've never seen
  I sail my memories of home
  Like boats across the Seine
And watch my father‘s eyes
Watch the setting sun
Set in my father's eyes — again

I'm on my way home
I Left 3 days ago
But no-ne seems to know i'm gone
Home is where the hatred is
Home is filled with pain
and it might not be such a bad idea
if i never went home again
Stand as far away from me as you can and ask me why
Hang on to your rosary beads, close your eyes to watch me die
You keep saying ""kick it, quit it"" but did you ever try?
To turn you sick soul out inside out
So that the world, So that the world can watch you die
Home is where I live inside
My white powder dreams
Home was once an empty vacuum,
thats filled now with my silent screams
Home is where the needle marks
Try to heal my broken heart
and it might not be such a bad idea
if i never went home again

It's a bore. Oh it's a bore. Oh it's a bore. Oh it's a bore.
Oh it's a blast the  radi o.

That she said. That she said. That she said.
So then he grabs his Chevro let
In one more at tempt to get a way
But the thoughts of all the crimes of passion lay
lay in his waaaaaaay.
He can shake the blues,
But you know he still can get con fused.
It seems like such a waste
'Cause he can't shake her.

He finds a joint that's jive
Guys are spinning girls like forty five's
All of the live bait sink for his lines they are so hi -i -iiiigh
He knows he is beat
As his heart puts on the heat
Ruuun from the street that don't even fit his feet
(Don't fit his feet. Now he can see. Now he can really see)
Tell him here's a tele phone

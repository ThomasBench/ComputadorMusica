The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold
Since you went away the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall

It takes a day to walk a mile
Time just stand still
And when the people you meet look at you they smile
They still believe in style
They serve you with their sambas 'til
You really know you're down in ol' Brazil
You can tell you're down in ol' Brazil
Down in Brazil
They've never heard of win or lose
If you can't feel
Then all those cafe ole girls in high heel shoes
Will really cure your blues
It seems they all just aim to please
Those women sway like wind in my ba nana trees
Then you know you're down in ol' Brazil
Down in Brazil
They know a million ways to play
You start to feel
And when you're happy
It's the same as when you pray
You'd think you get away
Then you know you never will
Now when you've been down in ol' Brazil
Now when you are down in ol' Brazil
      Down in old Brazil
      Down in old Brazil

Just another Technicolor romance on the screen

Os olhos verdinhos bastante puxados,
Cabelo castanho     e uma pinta do lado?

--- Just a silent room where tears won't dry
Life is sad when people hurt you
--- Sad when friends desert you
- Sad when dreams get lost --- beyond recall
But remembering --- that love stopped blossoming
And that's the saddest thing of all
Once we had it made, our days one grand parade
Of thrills and laughter --- only lovers know
- She was proud of me and we were young and free
One touch was all it took --- and off we go
Now above the rain ---- I hear a passing plane
--- And all my loneliness begins to show
Life is sad when people hurt you
--- Sad when friends desert you
- Sad when dreams get lost --- beyond recall
But remembering from spring to lonely spring
Well, that's the saddest thing of all

Soft as the dawn
Into    the light
This Child
Innocent Child
Soft as a fawn
This Child is born
One    small   heart
One pair of eyes
One work of art
Here in my         arms
Here he lies
Trusting and warm
Blessed  this    morn
A Child is born

46,Blues För Inga-Maj,Cornelis Vreeswijk,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/2498499,"Ingen motor har min båt.
Seglet är av rostfri plåt.
Grannarnna är inte koloka.
Femton ordningsvakter snoka,
vidta sina steg och mått,
mot moralens totala hm, hm,
sammanbrott.
Thjosan, fototombyte stamp.
Kom och gör ett övertramp.
Kasta loss i för och akter,
vi ger fan i alla vakter.
Strömen för oss vart den vill,
vad ska vi med deras hm, hm,
ordning till.
Ta en åra Inga-Maj.
Vi går till en bättre kaj.
Du får paddla jag får ösa,
vakterna blir arbetslösa,
ingenting att göra åt.
Låt dem gå på någons hm, hm 
annans båt.
Vattnet dansar skumt och våt,
ingen åra har min båt,
inget segel - inget roder,
men min systers enda broder,
löser lätt vart skjäproblem,
jag har eget hm,hm,
navigationssystem.
Inga-Maj kom med och lek.
Vi kan leka diskotek.
Här finns ingen vakt som stör oss,
ingen vet vart båten för oss.
Någon gång når man väl fram.
Eller hur, Gutår!
Gonatt, madam.

Our summer day withers away
Too soon, too soon.
Speak low       when you speak, love,
Our moment is swift, like  ships adrift,
We're swept apart too soon.
Speak low,   darling speak low,
Love is a spark lost in the dark,
Too soon, too soon,
I feel     wherever I go
That tomorrow is near, tomorrow is here
And always too soon.
Time is so old and love so brief,
Love is pure gold and time a thief.
We're late   darling, we're late,
The curtain descends, ev'rything ends
Too soon, too soon,
I wait darling, I wait
Will you speak low to me,
Speak love to me and soon.

48,Detroit City,Dean Martin,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/dean-martin/detroit-city-chords-3606596," I wanna go home
I wanna go home
Oh, how I wanna go home
Last night I went to sleep in Detroit city
And I dreamed about those cotton fields at home
I dreamed about my mother, dear old papa, sister and brother
I dreamed about that girl
  Who's been waiting for so long
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
Oh, how I want to go home
Home folks think I'm big in Detroit city
From the letters that I write they think I'm fine
But by day I make the cars
And by night I make the bars
If only they could read between the lines
You know, I rode a freight train north to Detroit city
After all these years I find I've just been wastin' my time
So I just think I'll take my foolish pride, put on a southbound train and ride
And go on back to the loved ones, the ones I left waitin' so far behind
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
Oh, how I want to go home
I wanna go home
I wanna go home
Oh, how I want to go home...
(Aaah...,aaah
(I wanna go home)
(Oh, how I want to go home)

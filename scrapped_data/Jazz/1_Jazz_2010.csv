You don't have to feel this emptiness
She said I love you till the day that I die
Maybe she's right
Cause I don't wanna feel like I'm not me
And to be honest I don't even know why
I let myself get down in the first place
Trying to keep my mind at bay
Sunflowers still grows at night
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
Make it down down, do-do-down
Make it do-down, du du du
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
You know you need to get yourself to sleep and dream
And dream of you and I
There's no need to keep an open eye
I promise I'm the one for you
Just let me hold you in these arms tonight
I'm lucky to be near you
You can see it in my face
Back when I fucked my shit up too many times
Why would I let myself get down in the first place
Trying to keep my mind at bay
Sunflowers still grows at night
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes

I love the way it grows
There's something in this sound that takes me far
It's like a special song
Can move my mood along
But I cannot say you'll hear through my guitar
She told me add a bassline
And everything will be alright
She told me that the groove is mine
It will take us through the night
And where I'll go
Can't explain I'll never know
But it's beautiful
You can't take this away from me
The way I hear the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
You can't take this away from me
The way I hear the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
I love the way it sings
All the joy that it brings
Remember skating down the road towards the park?
I can never say no
You with that summer glow
The music gives me sun when winter starts
She told me add a bassline
And everything will be alright
She told me that the groove is mine
It will take us through the night
And where I'll go
Can't explain I'll never know
But it's beautiful
You can't take this away from me
The way I hear the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
You can't take this away from me
The way I hear the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
You can't take this away from me
The way I hear the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
You can't take this away from me
The way I hear the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
Yo, I wear notes like coats
You can't take this away from me
The way I hear the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
You can't take this away from me
The way I hear the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me

This is a true love story song
A triumph, and a Glory song
With only one small caveat
This one hasn't happened yet
It's not the strongest narrative
But details aren't imperative
What matters is the way it ends
They've got sixteen mutual friends
Animal Spirits
Heartfelt lyrics
Put them together and
You can hear it
It's the song  everyone knows
Animal Spirits
Heartfelt lyrics
Put them together and
You can hear it
It's the way  the story goes
Now everyone seems unaware
That these two are a destined pair
But I checked out their astral chart
This one is a work of art
Now I know she reads astrology
And he can't stand astrology
But he's quick with an apology
When he wisecracks the zodiac
Animal Spirits
Heartfelt lyrics
Put them together and
You can hear it
It's the song  everyone knows
Animal Spirits
Heartfelt lyrics
Put them together and
You can hear it

Oh oh oh
And when the rising action rises
There is only one thing left, and that's the climax
Oh oh oh yeah
Twitter on your telly
Ramen in your belly

Put it in my pocket

Aries penny saver
Set a market order
Because I'm pretty sure I got this

Take a break at Yaddo
Economics
Put it in my pocket

Fairmount and Brainard
I can stay
You can stay, L.A

Birds are singing songs down from the trees
   Love is a beautiful thing
The breeze is blowing, rustling Autumn leaves
   But if those leaves are rustling underneath somebody else's feet
   If it's not me you see how could that be a thing of beauty?
I   find comfort in believing
Over time I'll come to see someday how love could be that way
   Love is a beautiful thing
Winter's rage has softened into spring
   Love is a beautiful thing
And on your hand I see that there's a ring
   And I would understand if I had put that ring upon your hand
   But it was not me, it seems
How could that be a thing of beauty?

 game to you?
All the time I felt you gave your heart I thought that I would 
do the same for you,
Tell the truth I think I should have seen it coming from a mile away,
When the words you say are,
""Baby I’m a fool who thinks it’s cool to fall in love""
If I gave a thought to fascination I would know it wasn’t 
right to care,
Logic doesn’t seem to mind that I am fascinated by the 
love affair,
Still my heart would benefit from a little tenderness from time to time, 
but never mind,
""Baby I’m a fool who thinks it’s cool to fall in love""
Baby I should hold on just a moment and be sure it’s not for vanity,
Look me in the eye and tell me love is never based upon insanity,
Hear the way my heart is beating every other moments fleeting,
Cause baby I’m a fool who thinks it’s cool to fall
""Baby I’m a fool who thinks it’s cool to fall
And I would never tell if you became a fool and fell in Love.

  And I'll admit that I miss you
  But only if you do

And I can't lie
It's hard seeing you with her
'cause I know she can't love you like I can

Don't wanna have to beg you to subscribe
Are you a man before your father dies?
""But what's a man these days?"" I hear you cry
And are we raising up our children right?
Is my career gonna reignite?
See all the virtue signalers tonight
I want that bandwagon to pass me by
Well, I've been scratching around in the dirt
Looking for meaning in the cold, cold earth
Cause only love is what survives of us
Cause I hold onto you
And you hold onto me
A tiny victory in the age of anxiety
Do those kids know that I was somebody?
And I've kept all my texts from Amy
Another stranger off the ferry
Don't wanna put my hands up in the air
And raise my phone up like I just don't care
Oh, did I waste my time on all that prayer?
No, I won't be your apparatchik
And be the kind who's blind to all its magic
With asylum seekers in your attic
So I hold onto you
And you hold onto me
A tiny victory in the age of anxiety
Today I do not feel like - being strong
And don't wanna admit to the world I'm wrong
I hope the band won't make me sing along
Cause I hold onto you
And you hold onto me
A tiny victory in the age of anxiety
A shining victory in the age of anxiety
   I hope the band won't make me sing along
   I hope the band won't make me sing along

Is your number the same as before?
Can't ignore, the time
May have changed your ways
Does my record still hang on your wall?
Such a sentimental way to groove
I hope it still touches you
Baby come back to me, come back to me
It kills me to see you leave
So I came home and made this beat
Baby come back to me, come back to me
Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie, movie
On every screen
What would you realize
What you meant to me, was a mystery
Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie, movie
On every screen
What would you realize
What you meant to me, was a mystery
Remember me, let's set the scene
You and me, what could've been
Still swimming in a lover's dream
Still playing on the movie screens
Remember me, let's set the scene
You and me, what could've been
Still swimming in a lover's dream
Remember me, let's set the scene
You and me, what could've been
Still swimming in a lover's dream
Remember me, let's set the scene
You and me, what could've been
Still swimming in a lover's dream

Back in double-oh-se        ven
Miss M was queen
She could roll like a pro         rolls
When she was seventeen
Wheteher straight or ha          mmered
She was the best in town
When she release the red        ball
All pins fall down
Can’t you hear the balls rum    ble
Can’t you hear the balls rum     ble 
Miss Mar lene--we’re still bowling
Every Saturday night
Saturday night
Your move to the lane        child
Played on my heartstrings
With you long skinny legs        child
And your hoop earrings
When the stakes were sky-        high
That’s when you’d always shine
The ball would ride a moon        beam
Down the inside lane
Can’t you hear the balls rum      ble
Can’t you hear the balls rum      ble
Miss Mar lene we’re bowling
Every Saturday night
Saturday night
And then one night
Something came apart
You were thrown back hurri canes
And we knew some
Had played with your heart
You ran into the dark      street
At University Place
The cab came up so fast        then
We saw your laughin’ face
Can’t you hear the balls rum     ble
Can’t you hear the balls rum    ble

league        night
I catch her scent again
Her hand guiding my        hand
We drop the seven-ten

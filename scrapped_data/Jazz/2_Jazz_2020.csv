To you, you, you and you
You’re running around (running around) looking at all the women, right?

1,Concorde,Gregory Porter,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/gregory-porter/concorde-chords-3262856,"  With a million stars in the galaxy
When I'm floating with them, it's hard for me to see
I'm holding onto this dear: ""Earth""
As it, spins around me
 With a million miles of odometry
And the moon like a goon, staring back at me
I'm holding onto this dear, ""Earth""
With love and gravity
60 thousand feet up in the air
I can't wait to come down, drop down
I've been that fool, I let my fuel run low
Let my people know, I'm all drop down
Slicing through the stra-tos-phere
Twice the speed of sound
My life is moving under me
Before I touch the grou-ound
30 thousand feet up in the air
I can't wait to get there, drop down
The only thing, I seem to see around
Is sand in which you stand, with-in my hand
Slicing through the stra-tos-phere
Twice the speed of sound
My life is moving under me
Before I touch the grou-ound, o'oh
Slicing through the stra-tos-phere
twice the speed of sound
You are my life, that's moving under me
Before I touch the grou-ound
Slicing through the stra-tos-phere
Twice the speed of sou-ound
My life is moving under me
Before I touch the grou-ou-oh-ound
And now, 10 thousand feet up in the air
I can't wait to get there
Drop do-own..   (outro in adagio)

And by some chance, I had brought my dice along
And there I stood, and I hollered ""Somebody fade me!""
But the passengers all knew right from wrong
For the people all said sit down
Sit down, you're roc kin' the boat
The people all said sit down
Sit down you're rockin' the boat
And the devil will drag you under
By the sharp lapel of your checkered coat
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down
Sit down you're rockin' the boat
I sailed away, on that little boat to heaven
And by some chance, found a bottle in my fist
And there I stood, nicely pas sin' out the whisky
But the passengers were bound to resist
For the people all said ""Beware
You’re on a heavenly trip.""
The people all said ""Be  ware
Beware, you'll scuttle the ship!""
And the devil will drag you under
By the fancy tie 'round your wicked throat
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down
Sit down, you're rockin' the boat
And as I laughed at those passengers to heaven
A great big wave came and knocked me overboard!
And as I sank, and I hollered ""Someone save me!""
That's the moment I woke up
Thank the Lord!
And I said to myself, sit down
Sit down, you're rockin' the boat
I said to myself sit down
Sit down, sit down you're rockin' this boat
And the devil will drag you under
With a soul so heavy you'd never float
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down
Sit down, stop rockin' the boat

You're from half the way from Dublin to Belfast
One night of chasing stars in Soho
was enough to make a present from our past
Smoking with a genius or a mad man
Shepherd's Bush has so much to answer for
You kissed me on a rainy street of London
We found a whole world in a corner of a door
Babe I gotta let you go
We both know it, we both know
Maybe I'm a complicated soul
'cause I can't say that I don’t want to see you again
Can't bring myself
To break it up today
How could I when it feels so God damn great
I've been alone in a crowded world of strangers and I've pushed everyone
Everyone but you away

Benevolent dude, I never refuse the
Truth when it hurts but it's good for you
Don't always look fly, just a regular guy
Dude with a hoodie and jeans and a beanie and a size thirteen
Sneak peek out the window
I'm a shy, young guy with a little bit of fame to my name
And the folks really like to come hear me sing
Got you down in the dirt with your messed up shirt
Like a leopard with the fangs, jumpin' up off the floor
Hoping and hoping and hoping for more
In the passenger seat, this journey I beast
And I never concede when I'm bringing the funk
I don't even know what you talkin' about
Every time I pick up the mic
And fam be reppin' and reppin', I'm like
I never been jailed, I never been popped
I never will have the message of Pac
May never have the voice that you rock
But I dare you to call me and tell me to stop
Didn't you hear the president sang?
Obama was singing, ""Amazing Grace""
There's so many things I'm delighted to say
Remember when the country was bae?
Flying a plane to Mars, with bars that rocket me to a new level

The more that you talk, the more that we bleed
You cut, you cut, you cut, you cut
And the deeper and deeper and deeper the stream
But this ultra light, not a regular beam
People is bursting up out of the seams
This is reality, not a dream
This is reality, and

 Just a minute before you touch the door
  What is it that you're trying to achieve?
  Do you think we can just talk about it some more?
The streets are filled with vipers
Who've lost all ray of hope
It ain't even safe no more
In the palace of the Pope
Don't fall apart on me tonight
I just don't think that I could handle it
Don't fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday's just a memory
Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be
And I need you, oh yeah
   Come over here from over there
  Sit down here. You can have my chair
  I can't see us goin' anywhere
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there
I wish I'd have been a doctor
Maybe I'd have saved some lives been lost
Maybe I'd have done some good in the world

Don't fall apart on me tonight

Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be

So, you might not know exactly how I feel
But if I could, I'd bring you to the mountaintop
And build you a house of stainless steel
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting
That's hanging in the Louvre
My throat start to tickle and my nose itches
But I know that I can't move
Don't fall apart on me tonight
I just don't think that I could handle it
Don't fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday's gone but the past lives on
Tomorrow's just one step beyond
And I need you, oh yeah
Who are these people walking toward you?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
With their humorless smiles so easy to see through
Can they tell you what's wrong from what's right?
Do you remember Napolean Street
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?
You were so fine, Clark Gable would've fell at your feet
And laid his life on the line
  Let's try to get beneath the surface waste
No more booby traps and bombs, No more decadence and charm
 No more affection that's misplaced,
 No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms
 What about that billionaire
With the drumsticks in his pants?
He looked so baffled, so bewildered
When he played and we didn't dance
Don't fall apart on me tonight
I just don't think that I could handle it
Don't fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday's just a memory
Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be
And I need you, oh yeah

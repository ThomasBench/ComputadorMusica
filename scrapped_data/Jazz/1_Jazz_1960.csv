And so I face, the final curtain.
My   friend, I'll say it clear,
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain.
I've lived, a life that's full,
I've traveled each, and every highway.
And more, much more than this,
I did it my way.
Regrets, I've had a few,
But then again, too few to mention.
I did, what I had to do,
And saw it through, without exemption.
I planned, each chartered course,
Each careful step, along the byway.
And more, much more than this,
I did it   my way.
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew,
When I bit off, more than I could chew.
But through it all, when there was doubt,
I ate it up, and spit it out.
I faced it all, and I stood tall,
And did it my way.
I've loved, I've laughed and cried,
I've had my fill, my share of    losing.
And now, as tears subside,
I find it all so amusing.
To think, I did all that,
And may I say, not in a shy way.
Oh, no, oh, no not me,
I did it my way.
For what is a man? What has he got?
If not himself, then he has naught.
To say the things, he truly feels,
And not the words, of one who kneels.
The record shows, I took the blows,
And did it my way.
 Yes it was my way

Fullmånen lyser som var den av glas
Där dansar Fredrik Åkare, kind emot kind
Med lilla fröken Cecilia Lind
Hon dansar och blundar så nära intill
Hon följer i dansen precis vart han vill
Han för och hon följer, lätt som en vind
Men säg varför rodnar Cecilia Lind
Säg var det för det Fredrik Åkare sa
""Du doftar så gott och du dansar så bra
din midja är smal och barmen är trind
Vad du är vacker, Cecilia Lind""
Men dansen tog slut och vart skulle dom gå
Dom bodde så nära varandra ändå
Till slut kom dom fram till Cecilias grind
Nu vill jag bli kysst sa Cecilia Lind
Vet hut Fredrik Åkare, skäms gamla karln
Cecilia Lind är ju bara ett barn
Ren som en blomma, skygg som en hind
""Jag fyller snart sjutton"" Sa Cecilia Lind
Och stjärnorna vandra och timmarna fly
Och Fredrik är gammal, men månen är ny
Ja Fredrik är gammal men kärlek är blind
""Åh kyss mig igen"" Sa Cecilia Lind

The park at evening when the bell has sounded
The `Ile-de-France` with all the gulls around it
The beauty that is spring`s...
These foolish things remind me of you
How strange, how sweet
To find you still
These things are dear to me
They seem to bring you near to me
The sigh of midnight trains in empty stations
Silk stockings tossed aside, dance invitations
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you...
These foolish things remind me of you

45,Desafinado,Ella Fitzgerald,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ella-fitzgerald/desafinado-chords-2585055,"Love is like a never-ending melody
Poets have compared it to a symphony
A symphony conducted by the lighting of the moon
But our song of love is slightly out of tune
Once your kisses raised me to a fever pitch
Now the orchestration doesn't seem so rich
Seems to me you've changed the tune we used to sing
Like the bossa nova,   love should swing
We used to harmonize, two souls in perfect time
  Now the song is diff'rent and the words don't even rhyme
'Cause you forgot the melody our hearts would always croon
  And so what good's a heart that's slightly out of tune
Tune your heart to mine the way it used to be
Join with me in harmony and sing a song of loving
We're bound to get in tune, again before too long
There'll be no desafinado
When your heart belongs to me completely
So you won't be slightly out of tune
You'll sing  along with me.
There'll be no desafinado
When your heart belongs to me completely
So you won't be slightly out of tune
You'll sing  along with me.
You'll sing  along with me.
You'll sing  along with me.

46,What A Wonderful World (ver 4),Louis Armstrong,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/louis-armstrong/what-a-wonderful-world-chords-687797,"I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom, for me and you,
And I think to myself, What a  wonderful world.
I see skies of blue and clouds of white,
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night,
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people goin' by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, ""How do you do?""
They're really saying,  ""I   love    you.""   I hear
Babies cry, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know,
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
   Yes I think to myself, what a wonderful world.

You're nobody till somebody cares
You may be king, you may possess
The world and its gold
But gold won't bring you happiness,
When you're growing old
The world still is the same,
You'll never change it,
As sure as the stars shine above,
You're nobody till somebody loves you,
So find yourself somebody to love.

Non ti si può pigliare come sei
I tuoi difetti son talmente tanti
Che nemmeno tu li sai
Sei peggio di un bambino capriccioso
La vuoi sempre vinta tu
Sei l'uomo più egoista e prepotente
Che abbia conosciuto mai
Ma c'è di buono che al momento giusto
Tu sai diventare un altro
In un attimo tu
Sei grande, grande, grande
Le mie pene non me le ricordo più
Io vedo tutte quante le mie amiche
Son tranquille più di me
Non devono discutere ogni cosa
Come tu fai fare a me
Ricevono regali e rose rosse
Per il loro compleanno
Dicono sempre di sì
Non hanno mai problemi e son convinte
Che la vita è tutta lì
Invece no, invece no
La vita è quella che tu dai a me
In guerra tutti giorni sono viva
Sono come piace a te
Ti odio poi ti amo poi ti amo
Poi ti odio poi ti amo
Non lasciarmi mai più
Sei grande, grande, grande
Come te sei grande solamente tu
Ti odio poi ti amo poi ti amo
Poi ti odio poi ti amo
Non lasciarmi mai più
Sei grande, grande, grande
Come te sei grande solamente tu
Non lasciarmi mai più
Sei grande, grande, grande
Come te sei grande solamente tu

49,How Insensitive,Antônio Carlos Jobim,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/72528,"How, insensitive,  I must have seemed
When she told me that she loved me
How unmoved and cold I must have seemed
When she told me so since----rely
Why, she must have asked?
Did I just turn and stare in icy----silence
What was I to say    What can you say
When a love afair is over.
Now, she's gone away, And I'm alone
With a memory of her last look
Vague, and drawn and sad, I see it still
All her heart break in that last look
How she must have asked
Could I just turn and stare in icy silence
What, was I To do, what can you do
When a love affair is over.

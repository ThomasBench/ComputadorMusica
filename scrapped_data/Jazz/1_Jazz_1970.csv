I want to be a part of it - New York, New York
These vagabond shoes, are longing to stray
Right through the very heart of it - New York, New York
I want to wake up in a city, that doesn't sleep
And find I'm king of the hill - top of the heap
These little town blues, are melting away
I'm gonna make a brand new start of it - in old New York
If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere
It's up to you - New York, New York

1,Southern Nights (ver 2),Glen Campbell,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/glen-campbell/southern-nights-chords-1791694,"Southern Nights, have you ever felt the southern night?
Free as a breeze, not to mention the trees, whistling
tunes that you know and love so.
Southern Nights, just as good even when closed your eyes.
I apologize, to any one who can truly say
that he has found a better way.
Southern Skies, have you ever noticed southern skies?
It's precious beauty lies just beyond the eye.
It goes running through your soul like the stories told of old.
Old man, he and his dog that walked the old land.
Every flower touched his cold hand.
As he slowly walked by, weeping willows would cry for joy.
Feels so good, feels so good it's frightening.
Wish I could, stop this world from fighting.
La da da da da da la da da da  da da

Mysteries, like this and many others in the trees.
Blow in the night, in the southern skies.
Southern nights, they feel so good it's frightening 
wish I could stop this world from fighting.

He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs throughout the south.
He spoke with tears of fifteen years how his dog and he traveled about.
His dog up and died,   up and died,
After twenty years he still grieved
He said, ""I dance now at every chance in honky tonks for drinks and tips.
But most of the time I spent behind these county bars,"" He said, ""I drinks a bit.""

All alone, I swear my hair stood up
And I said a prayer to end all prayers
I reached for the phone

And a voice inside my head
Said, ""Boss(Fred), go on back to bed

Just a jack knife has Macheath dear
And he keeps it way out of sight
When that shark bites with his teeth, dear
Scarlet billows begin to spread
Fancy gloves though has Macheath dear
So there's never, never a trace of red
On the sidewalk, one Sunday morning
Lies a body, oozin' life
Someone's sneaking 'round the corner
Could that someone be Mack the knife
From a tugboat, on the river going slow
A cement bag is dropping on down
You know that cement is for the weight dear
You can make a large bet Mackie's back in town
Look at Louis Miller, he dissappeared, dear,
After drawing out his cash
Now Macheath spends like a sailor
Do you suppose our boy, he's done something rash...

47,Heres That Rainy Day,Kenny Rankin,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/kenny-rankin/heres-that-rainy-day-chords-201932,"Maybe I should have saved those leftover dreams;
Funny, but here's that rainy day.
Here's that rainy day they told me about
And I laughed at the thought that
It could end this way.
Where is that worn out wish that I threw aside
After it brought my love so near?
Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day--
Funny, that rainy day is here.
Funny how love becomes a cold rainy day
Funny, that rainy day is here.

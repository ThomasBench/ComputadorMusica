But the story I'm told
Is your heart is as black as night
Your lips may be sweet
Such that I can't compete
But your heart is as black as night
I don't know why you came along
At such a perfect time
But if I let you hang around
I'm bound to lose my mind
'Cause your hands may be strong
But the feeling's all wrong
Your heart is as black as night
I don't know why you came along
At such a perfect time
But if I let you hang around
I'm bound to lose my mind
'Cause your hands may be strong
But the feeling's all wrong
Your heart is as black
Your heart is as black
Oh, your heart is as black as night

I'll make it simple when - others may not . . . . .
 Whenever you need some company
 Some love of a different kind
 Come to your lover,   undercover
 And let me ease - your mind
 Whenever your heart beats heavy
 And worry has got you down
 Come to your lover, undercover
And I will turn    your mood around
Why you wanna leave when it's so easy just to stay?
Lying wrapped up in my arms,   until the break of day
Un---dercover
Why you wanna leave when it's so easy just to stay?
Lying wrapped up in my arms, until the break of day

 Make me a lover, undercover
Or don't ever love me  . . . at all . . .

Like Adam was to Eve, you were made for me

Our love is easy

I'd like to have you round just for them rainy days
I like the touch of your hand, the way you make no demands
Our love is easy
Our love is easy
Like water rushing over stone
Oh, our love is easy,
like no love I've ever known
Physically speaking we were made to last
Examine all the pieces of our recent past
There's your mouth I taste
Your hands around my waist
Our love is easy
Every time we meet it's like the first we kissed
Never growing tired of this endlessness
It's a simple thing, we don't need a ring
Our love is easy
Our love is easy
Like water rushing over stone
Oh, our love is easy,

Rain came down in sheets that night
 And you and I stared out to the left and to the right
 Rain came down and cursed, seemed to laugh at us
Still daylight
 The clouds, the clouds
Clouds raced all across the autumn sky
 And you and I fumbled for a way to say goodbye

 Scared to look into each other's eyes?

Of your dark and empty room
All the gutters run with silver
Underneath the light of the moon
I can see you there drawn and pacing
Hiding even from your precious son
All the prophecies they say the same thing
Beware of the perilous one
Don't beg for mercy
What's done is done
I'm gonna break this window
I'm gonna fire this gun
If you're halfway human
Your heart's a storm
Now face the morning
With daggers drawn
Bona Dea what's this feeling
Nobody will say its name
I have tried all kinds of ancient healing
Still my heart is covered in clay
Well my sister pass that bottle
Well my brother pass that flame
Under the darkening mountain shadows
We will shout out into the rain
Don't beg for mercy
What's done is done
I'm gonna break this window
I'm gonna fire this gun
If you're halfway human
Your heart's a storm
Now face the morning
With daggers drawn
Do you remember those distant mornings
Nobody there knew my name
I used to call myself a kind of hunter
When you came to me covered in flames
Never questioned what I fight for
It was unchangeable, like the sun
We have always been the lonely nighthawks
Watching out for the perilous one
Don't beg for mercy
What's done is done
I'm gonna break this window
I'm gonna fire this gun
If you're halfway human
Your heart's a storm
Now face the morning
With daggers drawn
Don't beg, don't beg, don't beg

   When you're falling in love
   There's a silence, the ending darkness feels
   When you're singing with love
   Remembering life, a good blessed life
   I'm forgetting all my troubles
   I'm forgetting all my troubles
   There's a summer, a frozen heart recalls
   When you're breathing with love
   There's a pathway, the silver candle shines
   When you're seeing with love
   Remembering life, a good blessed life
   I'm forgetting all my troubles
   I'm forgetting all my troubles
   There's a quivering, the waken forest gives
   When you're dancing with love
   There's a humming, the diamond raindrops hum
   When you're crazy with love
   Remembering life, a good blessed life
   I'm forgetting all my troubles
   I'm forgetting all my troubles
   Uh uh uh uh uh

We don't really care, we don't really give a damn
You're like an angel playin' with my heartstrings
For life or a day, for real or pretend
If I had my way, this feeling would never end
You're like an angel playin' with my heartstrings
You're asking me not to leave you
And baby, that makes me smile
Let's get our house with a sea view
Forever or just for a little while
We'll drink some champagne, we'll look at the stars
And do it again, 'cause baby, the world is ours
You're like an angel playin' with my heartstrings
Sometimes I think we're only
On a daytrip to Disneyland
But remember that night you got lonely
And asked my daddy for my hand?
Havin' a bite, havin' a ball
Talkin' all night and dancin' until we fall
You're like an angel playin' with my heartstrings
You don't call me for days, heaven forbid
The next thing you say you want me to have your kids
You're like an angel playin' with my heartstrings
You're like an angel playin' with my heartstrings

That was created just for me.
_ Some knowing mind, some guiding hand
_ Must have designed, must have planed it.
_ You're like a garden in a land
Of barren rock and lonely sand,
_ Where rain can fall, where grass can grow
_ And through it all, I can love you so.
Isn't it strange, but it's only a feeling
Isn't it weird, it feels like I'm stealing your soul.
Isn't it wild, this world that we know now
It's gonna be fun wherever we go now.
_ You're like a prayer I'm scared to say
The one who might have got away
_ Somebody worth all I've had to face
_ No one on Earth could replace you.
_ You're like a secret symphony
That was created just for me.
_ Some knowing mind, some guiding hand
_ Must have designed, must have planed it.

45,Excuse My French,Caro Emerald,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/caro-emerald/excuse-my-french-chords-3889844,"I don't know what you must be on,
you walked in like the Aga  Khan.
Did you fly in on a jet? Win a million dollar bet?
So, let me get my good shoes on.
I wanna follow in the same old steps,
where you waltz around like you're the best.
Where your garden blooms in May but it's snowing every day
'cause you have everything you want.
You must be   the Houdini in my life
but you can't see     I could never be your wife.
'Cause I'm still a    lady, no, I'm not  some wench
that falls for your lines, I'm not on the fence.
Your routine is   fading, boy, I could use a wrench,
I know my words won't fail me, please excuse my   French. Pardonne-moi.
Today you think you're Errol Flynn,
sharing stories where you think you've been.
Your style must be cramped without a passport stamp.
Can't you see the twister that you're in?
Lie down inside a sea of words,
you're going under, now you won't get hurt.
So, just give it a rest, this time your more is less,
you're going solo in this dream.
You must be   the Houdini in my life
but you can't see     I could never be your wife.
'Cause I'm still a    lady, no, I'm not  some wench
that falls for your lines, I'm not on the fence.
Your routine is   fading, boy, I could use a wrench,
I know my words won't fail me, please excuse my   French. Pardonne-moi.

Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more
Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me
Other dancers may be on the floor, dear
But my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway I go weeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaak
I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
Other dancers may be on the floor, dear
But my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway I go weeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaak
I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more

To bring me back

 Not pale in com-parison to who you think I am.
You always wanna talk it through;  I don't care!
I always have to comfort you,   when I'm there.
But that's what I need you to do; stroke my hair.

 Feel like a lady, but you my lady boy.
 You should be stronger than me,
 But instead you're longer than frozen turkey.
 Why'd you always put me in con-trol?
 All I need is for my man to live up to his role.
Always wanna talk it through;   I'm O-K.

you heard the night before. And though it's just a line to you

the evening gets late and I'm alone with you.

It's the rest of a stump, it's a little alone
It's a sliver of glass, it is life, it's the sun
It is night, it is death, it's a trap, it's a gun
The oak when it blooms, a fox in the brush
The knot in the wood, the song of a thrush
The will of the wind, a cliff, a fall
A scratch, a lump, it is nothing at all
It's the wind blowing free, it's the end of the slope
It's a beam, it's a void, it's a hunch, it's a hope
And the river bank talks of the waters of March
It's the end of the strain, it's the joy in your heart
The foot, the ground, the flesh and the bone
The beat of the road, a slingshot's stone
A fish, a flash, a silvery glow
A fight, a bet, the range of a bow
The bed of the well, the end of the line
The dismay in the face, it's a loss, it's a find
A spear, a spike, a point, a nail
A drip, a drop, the end of the tale
A truckload of bricks in the soft morning light
The shot of a gun in the dead of the night
A mile, a must, a thrust, a bump,
It's a girl, it's a rhyme, it's a cold, it's the mumps
The plan of the house, the body in bed
And the car that got stuck, it's the mud, it's the mud
A float, a drift, a flight, a wing
A hawk, a quail, the promise of spring
And the river bank talks of the waters of March
It's the promise of life, it's the joy in your heart
A snake, a stick, it is John, it is Joe
It's a thorn in your hand and a cut in your toe
A point, a grain, a bee, a bite
A blink, a buzzard, a sudden stroke of night
A pass in the mountains, a horse and a mule
In the distance the shelves rode three shadows of blue
And the river bank talks of the waters of March
It's the promise of life in your heart, in your heart
A stick, a stone, the end of the load
The rest of a stump, a lonesome road
A sliver of glass, a life, the sun
A night, a death, the end of the run
And the river bank talks of the waters of March
It's the end of all strain, it's the joy in your heart

Can't tell who he's lookin' to.
'Cos you all look the same; every-one knows your name,
And that's you whole claim to fame.
Ne-ver miss a night, 'cuz your dream in life,
Is to be a foot-ballers wife.
You don't like players, that's what you say-a,
But you really wouldn't mind a million-aire.
You don't like ballers, they don't do nothing for ya,
But you'd love a rich man, six feet two or taller.
You're more than a fan, look-in' for a man,
But you end up with one-night-stands.
He could be your whole life, if you got past one night,
But that part never goes right.
In the morning you're vexed, he's onto the next,
And you didn't even get no taste.
Don't be too up-set, if they call you a skank,
'Cos like the news; every-day you get pressed.
You don't like players, that's what you say-a,
But you really wouldn't mind a million-aire.
You don't like ballers, they don't do nothing for ya,
But you'd love a rich man, six feet two or taller.
You can't sit down right, 'cos you jeans are too tight,
And your lucky it's ladies night.
With your big empty purse, every week it gets worse,
At least your breasts cost more than hers.
So you did Mia-mi, 'cos you got there for free,
But somehow, you missed the plane.
You did too much E;  met somebo-dy,
And spent the night getting caned.
Without girls like you, there'd be no fun;
We'd go to the club, and not see any-one.
Without girls like you, there's no night-life,
All those men just go home to their wives.
Don't be mad at me, 'cos you're pushing thir-ty,
And your old tricks no longer work.
You should have known from the job, that you always get dumped;
So dust off your fuck me pumps.

Emptiness, a lonely parody,
And my life, another smokin’ gun
A sign of my indifference.
Always keepin’ safe inside
Where no one ever had a chance
To penetrate or break in.

That they could never get in.
Kept my cool under lock and key
And I never shed a tear
Another sign of my condidtion
Fear of love or bitter vanity
That kept me on the run
The main events at my confession
I kept a chain upon my door
That would shake the shame of Cain
Into a blind submission
The burning ghost without a name
Was calling all the same

The further I'd crawl
I was crawlin' into the fire
The more that I saw
The further I'd fall

The reason for the run and hide
Had totaled my existence
Everything left on the other side
Could never be much worse that this
But could I go the distance
  I faced the door and all my shame
Tearin' off each piece of chain
Until they were broken
But no matter how I tried
The other side was locked so tight
The door it wouldn't open
Gave it all that I got
Shouted for someone

Gotta knock a little harder
Gotta knock a little harder

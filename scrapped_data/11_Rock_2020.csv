With a taped back face
Our soft spoken queen
Takes her place on the stage
As the big curtains open
The last troops run in quick
For the one and only
Marlene Dietrich
  She whispers Demurely
'from The Blue Angel'
The song we all know
The one that we've paid for
Fills the hall tight
And pulls at our hearts
And puts in her place
The girl she once was
In that suit of '33
Soundtracked by disapproving commentary
And my shuddering neighbour
Turns and roughly rouses me
He says, 'While a kiss on the lips may not make a frog a prince
An orgasm renders any queen a witch: metamorphosis exists!'
Damn all us idiots
Damn us till death
Relentlessly trying to untie our knots of
Rivers and roads that defy all sense
But her hands loosen all
And her voice brings you youth
Her cheeks cradle the holy breath
That pumps the lungs of her Mackie Messer, ooh
And she beats the heart of her Mackie Messer, ooh
And she walks the stage with her Mackie Messer, ooh
And she makes us smile with her Mackie Messer, ooh

In this quiet town, families are tight
Good people, they still don't deadbolt their doors at night
In this quiet town
When we first heard opioid stories, they were always in whispering tones
Now banners of sorrow mark the front steps of childhood homes
And merit badge milestones with their daughters and sons
Laying there lifeless in their suits and gowns
Somebody's been keepin' secrets
In this quiet town, they know how to live
Good people who lean on Jesus, they're quick to forgive
In this quiet town
Now whenever I'm near the town I'll find some reason to give
And I will walk with the dead and the living where I used to live
And every time I see my parents in the prime of their lives
Offering their son the kind of love he could never put down
Well, part of me is still that stainless kid, lucky
In this quiet town, salt of the land
Hard-working people, if you're in trouble, they'll lend you a hand

I just need to let it go, waiting on a miracle

I just need to let it go, turn it down and lay low
It's just the way it goes, easy come, easy go
Sometimes I drive a little too fast
Think I'm running from demons of my past
So I wrote a song to help me slow down
Keep my mind straight but it's a bit late
I'm not gonna lie to you, I miss you so much
Tell me what I did wrong to lose touch?
I'm not gonna lie to you, this has been a hard year

Remember when you got sick, cancer of the bone
Everyone at school while you sitting at home
In your wheelchair of grief, find no relief
We were there for the ups and downs and there for the constant rounds of chemo
Yeah, you know that you are our hero
You were there when I was a zero
And I swear I'll make things right before the long night
Swear I'll make things right, tomorrow
But as for tonight

I'm not alright, but I don't need comfort
I don't want to talk

Him in the leopard pattern coat that you wish you'd shared
You in your brand nеw sweatsuit and your fresh platinum hair

If I leave you tonight, will he leave your eyes wide?
Bet he didn't think first when he did a crowd surf
Effortlessly expert, attention grabber

And I hope you spend the rest of your life sleeping alone
I hope the problems that make your life harder
Sit stubborn in your stomach like your kidney stones"", and yet

With pissed-up eyes glossed with early conversations

Without wanting to hit yourself?

Fighting then we fuck, you're my only type, yeah
Mixing bad decisions up with one night stands and Hennessey
All I got's this broken heart but you can have the rest of me
Yeah, break up just to make up (Make up)
You're gonе when I wake up
Yeah, brеak up just to make up (Make up)
You're gone when I wake up
When you come back, I'll be waiting (I'm missing you)
There's something you're not saying
When you come back, I'll be waiting (Is it someone new?)
There's something you're not saying
I'm missing you
Is it someone new?
She’s got makeup by the mirror in her bedroom
Thigh-high fishnets and some black boots
Nose pierced with the cigarette perfume
Half dead but she still looks so cute
She is a monster in disguise
Takes pics with a cherry-red lipstick
Says she only dates guys with a big- (Mm)
I fell in love with an emo girl
I’m in love with an emo girl
I fell in love with an emo girl
All I want is an emo girl
She puts her eyeliner on her dark skin
She tells me lies but she knows all of my secrets
And when we drive in the car and I say “Who is this bitch?”
So, so, so many regrets, you tell me you’re depressed
I fell in love with an emo girl

We’re getting hotter than love, hahaha
Bruises don't heal overnight
I'm a few sips from pulling the trigger
Self-abusive, on the borderline
If having you'll be my grave digger
Leave, leave, leave me now
Please, please, save yourself
Leave, leave, leave me now
Before I hurt someone else
You're crazy (5150)
I won't go (5150)
You make me (5150)
I'm damaged (Please don't fix me)
I romanticized
All the wrong things for the wrong reasons
Now I'm paralyzed
Traumatized so I had to get even
Plead, plead, plead me out
Please, please, save yourself
Leave, leave, leave me now
Before I hurt myself
You're crazy (5150)
I won't go (5150)
You make me (5150)
I'm damaged (Please don't fix me)
It's time to confess, confess why you said this
Time to confess, confess that you're heartless

Okay, I confess, I confess, I was jealous
Time to confess, confess that you're heartless
Okay, I confess, I confess, I'm a narcissist
You're crazy (5150)

 Bleach my hair,   mess it up
   Take my life, dress it up
 Signed a deal,   I got papercuts
   They wanted them, but they got us
           Yeah, yeah, uh
 Sleepin' in,   faked sick
   Smoked a blunt, had a kid
 Don't belong,   I'm a punk
   Hello world, you fuckin' suck
 Hey,   hey,   keep my mouth shut and wave
 Hey,   hey,   I'm dancin' on my grave
 Mhmm,           mhmm
 Everybody's so nice   lately
   Everybody's not nice
Polarized feelings, I don't wear them on my face   lately
   I don't wear them on my face
Internalized everything the headlines say   lately
   Everything they say
Demonized just because I was an angel face   baby   Baby
Career suicide
 Hey,   hey,   keep my mouth shut and wave
 Hey,   hey,   I'm dancin' on my grave
 Mhmm,           mhmm
I spend a lot of nights thinking
I might go to sleep and never wake up
I spend a lot of money on these therapy sessions
Even though I'm not showing up
I spend a lot of time healing my mind and my heart
But I still put these drugs in my gut
Me and my girl were just screaming at each other
Right before we both got out of the truck
I got some demons inside
I'm tryna free them inside
Where the boy who was just starving with you
Now might try to eat you alive, damn
Y'all said that I switched genres
I saw the limit and took it farther
I'm a genius, could've made Donda
But this song is for my dead father, uh
The  zombie apocalypse is   not too far away
  I think I  wrote, but it's real when I'm kind of afraid to say
Any thoughts in my mind,   they wanna monitor us
  Let's go and find the mainframe and pull the monitor off
I hear too many interviews from these artists in the news
Speakin' on my name, so this is what we're gonna do
I got ten fingers, just two, both hands, fuck you
Ten toes, black boots, stomp the shit   outta you
      Go!
             Okay, here's some rules:
   Your teachers are full of shit
You don't need to go to school
Life's gonna kick your ass anyways
Hold me  under
This frozen ice   you call your heart
  There's lightning  and thunder
   The armageddon's 'bout to start
          It's World  War Four
             Yeah
           It's World War Four
I wrote a letter to myself
In the form of a song I can play when the sun shines
I know better than to trust
Anything that I say to myself when I'm this high
Ay, ay, ay, ay
I don't wanna ever wanna fall when I'm this high
Ay, ay, ay, ay
I don't wanna ever wanna fall when I'm this high

Only comments I see are the bad ones (Yeah, yeah)
Only playlists I like are the sad ones
Yeah, I let thе medicine in
But I got depression again
I had a meeting at 7
I skipped it and slept in and woke up at 7 PM
I cut my hair off like Brittney
Sprinkled dust like a Pixie
Wiped my nose like it's itchy
I'm tatted up, I don't give a fuck, yeah
Ay, ay, ay, ay
I don't wanna ever wanna fall when I'm this high
Ay, ay, ay, ay
I don't wanna ever wanna fall when I'm this high
When I'm this high, when I'm this high

It's a full moon, where the good shrooms?
I'm too fucking high, sound like a good school
Higher than Jehova
High with the heavens, you know
I'ma get pulled over
I might need a chauffeur
Lean in my soda so I'ma need a shoulder
Why you got yo' nose up? I smell like Guns N' Roses
Ay, ay, ay, ay
I don't wanna ever wanna fall when I'm this high
Ay, ay, ay, ay
I don't wanna ever wanna fall when I'm this high
I don't wanna ever wanna fall when I'm this high

'Cause the antagonist looked just like you
It's such a pretty thing, but I see right through
You got a dark side, well, I got a dark side too
Ayy, I don't trust a soul, not even dead ones (Dead ones)
All it took was leavin' me on read once (Read once)
You still try to call me when you get drunk (Get drunk)

Killed the me I used to be
I might die in California
In my mind, I had a dream
Saw a demon on my shoulder
Yeah, I know, I should probably let it go (Let it go)
Yeah, I know, I might die in California, die in California, mmm
Ayy, someone cut the lights off please
I've been kinda sad lately
I know that I'm good for you (Yeah)
But you kinda bad, baby (Mm)
We're just doin' love chants, brewin' up the potion
I had a premonition I was overdosin' (So)
Someone cut the lights off please
I don't want you to look at me
I paint my nails black
If I ever look happy then it's an act
Every day is an anxiety attack
I wish I could take it back
To when I was drinkin' water out the tap
With the Cleveland logo printed on my hat
Tell me, was it my fear of bein' complacent
That ended up leavin' me so jaded?
I'm miserable even though I made it
Got a house in the Hills and I fuckin' hate it (Ayy)
Killed the me I used to be
I might die in California
In my mind, I had a dream
Saw a demon on my shoulder
Yeah, I know, I should probably let it go (Let it go)
Yeah, I know, I might die in California, die in California
    They gon' be missin' me
It's gon' be chaos when it come down to my royalties
I keep it still, I miss the exit, that's by any means (Woah)
I chop up an ice watch, fill the closet with anything
I got on Prada shoes and Prada tee (Yes)
I love my brother, rest in peace, I know you're proud of me
I'm pourin' mud, I'm tryna stay away from Billie Jean
Open up all the opens, everybody sayin' I'm half asleep
And I got demons on my shoulder, heart gettin' colder, I'm so cold
Keep me a heater, that's my toaster
In my cut, you would never know
The streets don't know you, I don't either
I don't need ya, no-no-no
I pray on my knees and I stay strong
Take care of my family, don't wan' die alone
Killed the me I used to be
I might die in California
In my mind, I had a dream
Saw a demon on my shoulder
Yeah, I know, I should probably let it go (Let it go)
Yeah, I know, I might die in California, die in California
All this bread make her spit up
When I did, ayy, look, I made you sit up
I don't talk to a pillow
I don't walk, Rolls Royce Truck
Tell the old ladies that her baby's goin' sad (Ah)
I told that bitch I been a service for the rap (Grrah, grrah)
I can take the jets to Seattle without the scan
I can shoot this bitch like a veteran with the size (Grrah, grrah)
911 Porsche came gray like granny
Now I'm in L.A., I done OD'd on twenty xannies
Slime, I see my baby smile, wah-wah
She tryna kiss it while we ride (Mwah)
We 'bout to fuck around and die (Fuck around and die)
Even in the Hills, got eyes (Eyes)
Now she tryna hire another spy
Killed the me I used to be
I might die in California
In my mind, I had a dream
Saw a demon on my shoulder
Yeah, I know, I should probably let it go (Let it go)
Yeah, I know, I might die in California, die in California, mmm
A   - x121414xx or 577xxx
I knew a girl who'd wear my t-shirts when she went to sleep at night
She'd make sure I'm breathin' in the morning
We were locked inside a room, I ate a pill shaped like the moon
Put her tongue inside my mouth like she wanted it
   We   can't hide this secret anymore
I'm in---side, I let you take control
   Once we met, I cannot love someone again
Cut my chest, gave you my heart and soul
Wait, where ya goin'?
Close my eyes
   She said, “I'm comin' with you tonight""
    Yeah, close my eyes
      Count to ten and see if I die
I knew a girl who saw me cry before 'cause I was broken
I was in hell, burning alive, how did you find me here?
She wrapped her arms around her body and said, ""Don't stop holding""
Now start the car, baby, and take me the fuck out of here
Rip  my   shirt, I feel your skin on mine
This is  yours, you can take my life
Drip my  words onto the page
Your knife, did not work, oh
Wait, where ya goin'?
Close my eyes
   She said, “I'm comin' with you tonight""
    Yeah, close my eyes
      Count to ten and see if I die
    Write it in blood and we'll both sign
    Sid and Nancy, another suicide
    These are her words and mine
      Sid and Nancy, another suicide
I'm not watching you with somebody else in this life or the next life
I'm not sorry, I don't care if you cry, if we die, then we die
Let's go
Wait, where ya goin'?
Close my eyes
   She said, “I'm comin' with you tonight""
    Yeah, close my eyes
      Count to ten and see if I die
    Write it in blood and we'll both sign
    Sid and Nancy, another suicide
    These are her words and mine
      Sid and Nancy, another suicide
Yeah
It's been six days, since the last time I saw your face and you ask my sign
I told you mine, I question why, then you said, ""Everything's aligned""
On the first day, you told me, ""I was your twin flame from a past life""
And tonight, the moon is full, so take me anywhere outside
I cannot kiss you, yeah, you're magic, so I'll just stare at you instead
I get insecure and panic, 'cause I know you're too pure for this
You're too good for me, I'm too bad to keep
I'm too sad lonely, I want you only
Hey, I got six ways to say that, ""I fell in love with you at first sight""
I wish that I could flame the way you look at me with those eyes
Freezе time, baby, rewind
Maybe ask you еarlier, ""Be mine""
See, I didn't understand déjà vu, 'till I met you
You're too good for me, I'm too bad to keep
I'm too sad lonely, I want you only
You're too good for me, I'm too bad to keep
I'm too sad lonely, I want you only
Go to sleep, I'll see you in my dreams
This changes everything, now I have to set you free

Better check yourself in
The mirage is creeping outwards from your dream

Followed the bows of the anciеnt railroads
Need to rendezvous wherе clouds can't misconstrue

I will go on my way because it's what I need

Land on a golden thread

It ain't easy to forget you
I want to hear you say
There's a part of me you'll take away forever
And that would do

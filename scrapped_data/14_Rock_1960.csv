When my eyes beheld an eerie sight.
For my monster from his slab began to rise,
And suddenly to my surprise.
He did the mash, he did the monster mash.
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash.
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash.
He did the mash, he did the monster mash.
From my laboratory in the castle east,
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast. 
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes, 
To catch a jolt from my electrodes.
He did the mash, he did the monster mash.
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash.
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash.
He did the mash, he did the monster mash.
The zombies were having fun..The party had just begun.
The guests included Wolf Man..Dracula and his son. 
The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds, 
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds. 
The Coffin-Bangers were about to arrive,
With their vocal group, ""The Crypt-Kicker Five."" 
He did the mash, he did the monster mash.
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash.
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash.
He did the mash, he did the monster mash.
Out from his coffin, Drac's voice did ring.
Seems he was troubled by just one thing.
He opened the lid and shook his fist,
And said, ""Whatever happened to my Transylvanian Twist?"" 
It's now the mash..It's now the monster mash.
The monster mash..and it's a graveyard smash.
It's now the mash..It caught on in a flash.
It's now the mash..It's now the monster mash.
Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band,
And my monster mash is the hit of the land. 
For you, the living, this mash was meant too, 
When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you.
Then you can mash..then you can monster mash.
The monster mash..And do my graveyard smash.
Then you can mash..You'll catch on in a flash,
Then you can mash..Then you can monster mash.

Let's drink to the lowly of birth
Raise your glass to the good and the evil
Let's drink to the salt of the earth

Spare a thought for his back breaking work
Say a prayer for his wife and his children

Let's think of the wavering millions
Who need leaders but get gamblers instead
Spare a thought for the stay at-home voter
His empty eyes gaze at strange beauty shows
And a parade of the gray suited grafters
A choice of cancer or polio
And when I search a faceless crowd
A swirling mass of gray and
Black and white

In fact, they look so strange

Day after day, alone on a hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
But, nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool,
And he never gives an answer.
But, the fool on the hill sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round.
Well on the way, head in a cloud,
The man of thousand voices talking perfectly loud.
But, nobody ever hears him, or the sound he appears to make,
And he never seems to notice.
But, the fool on the hill sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round.
                        Round round round round.
And nobody seems to like him, they can tell what he wants to do,
And he never shows his feelings.
But, the fool on the hill sees the sun going down,
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round.
        Oh,         oh.     Round round round round.
He never listens to them, he knows that they're the fools,

Though she was born a long, long time ago, your mother should know,
   Your mother should know.
Lift up your hearts and sing me a song,
That was a hit before your mother was born.
Though she was born a long, long time ago, your mother should know,
    Your mother should know.
    Your mother should know,        your mother should know.

Strawberry Fields forever.
Living is easy with eyes closed,   misunderstanding all you see.
It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out.

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs,
Of every head he's had the pleasure to have known.
And all the people that come and go, stop and say “Hello”.
On the corner is a banker with a motor car.
The little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mac, in the pouring rain.
Very strange.   Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies, I sit and mean-while back,
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hour-glass.
And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean, it's a clean machine.
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies in summer. Mean-while back,
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout,
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray.
And though she feels as if she’s in a play, she is anyway.
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer.
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain.
Very strange.   Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies, I sit and mean-while back,
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies.    Penny Lane.
How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?

How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?
Tuned to a natural E,      happy to be that way.

You thought they were all a-kiddin' you
 You used to laugh about
 Everybody that was hangin' out
 Now you don't talk so loud
 Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
The sweet pretty things are in bed now of course
But the town has no need to be nervous
Mama's in the factory
She ain't got no shoes
Daddy's in the alley
He's lookin' for food 
I'm in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues
Well, if I die
On top of the hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiilllllllll
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.
You walk into the room
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
And you say, ""Who is that man?""
You try so hard
But you don't understand
Just what you will say
When you get home
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
You have many contacts
Among the lumberjacks
To get you facts
When someone attacks your imagination
Anyway they already expect you
To just give a check
To tax-deductible charity organizations
When your mother sends back all your invitations
And your father to your sister he explains
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

Que vous soyez flic ou badaud
Je tue celui qui fait un pas
Non, je ne ferai pas de cadeau
Eteignez tous ces projecteurs
Et baissez vos fusils braqués
Non, je ne vais pas m'envoler sans elle                                            
Dites au curé, dites au pasteur
Qu'ailleurs ils aillent se faire pendre
Le diable est passé de bonne heure
Et mon âme n'est plus à vendre
Si vous me laissez cette nuit
A l'aube je vous donnerai ma vie
A quoi me servirai ma vie sans elle
Je n'étais qu'un fou mais par amour
Elle a fait de moi un fou, un fou d'amour
Mon ciel c'était ses yeux, sa bouche
Ma vie c'était son corps, son corps
Je l'aimais tant que pour la garder je l'ai tuée
Pour qu'un grand amour vive toujours
Il faut qu'il meure, qu'il meure d'amour   
Le jour se lève la nuit pâlit
Les chasseurs et les chiens ont faim
C'est l'heure de sonner l'hallali
La bête doit mourir ce matin
Je vais ouvrir grand les volets
Crevez-moi le coeur, je suis prêt
Je veux m'endormir pour toujours près d'elle
Je n'étais qu'un fou mais par amour
Elle a fait de moi un fou, un fou d'amour
Mon ciel c'était ses yeux, sa bouche
Ma vie c'était son corps, son corps
Je l'aimais tant que pour la garder je l'ai tuée
Je ne suis qu’un fou, Un fou d’amour
Un pauvre fou, qui meurt, qui meurt d'amour

on a tour of one night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand and every
stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one man band.
Homeward Bound, I wish I was, Homeward Bound. 
Home where my thought’s 
  Escaping, home where my music’s playing, 
home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.
Every day’s an endless stream of 
cigarettes and magazines.
Mm mm mm
And each town looks the same to me, the movies and the factories and
Every stranger’s face I see reminds me that I long to be,
Homeward Bound, I wish I was, Homeward Bound. 
Home where my thought’s 
  Escaping, home where my music’s playing, 
home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.
Tonight I’ll sing my songs again, 
I’ll play the game and pretend.        
Mm mm mm
But all my words come back too me in shades of mediocrity like emptiness
In harmony I need someone to comfort me
Homeward Bound, I wish I was, Homeward Bound. 
Home where my thought’s 
  Escaping, home where my music’s playing, 
home where my love lies waiting
Silently for me.
        Silently for me.

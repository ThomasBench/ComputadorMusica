Hab die Welt verflucht, in den Wind gespuckt,
    und salziges Wasser geschluckt.
   Als wir den Anker warfen war es himmlische Ruh
und die Sonne stand senkrecht am Himmel.
Als ich über die Reeling sah, da glaubte ich zu träumen,
da war'n tausend Boote und sie hielten auf uns zu.
   In den Booten waren Männer und Frau´n,
ihre Leiber glänzten in der Sonne.
Und sie sangen ein Lied das kam mir seltsam bekannt vor,
aber so - hatt ich's noch nie gehört, uuh
so hatt ich’s noch nie gehört.
Aloha heja he    aloha heja he     aloha heja he
Aloha heja he    aloha heja he     aloha heja he

   Sie nahmen ihre Blumenkränze ab, und warfen sie zu uns herüber,
Hey und schon war die Party im Gange.
Aloha heja he    aloha heja he     aloha heja he
Aloha heja he    aloha heja he     aloha heja he

It seems the world's falling down around me.
The nights are all long, I'm singing this song
to try and make the answers more than maybe.
And I'm so con-fused, about what to do, sometimes I wanna 
throw it all away.
So here I am, looking older all the time. Growing older 
all the time, feeling younger in my mind.
And here I am, doin everything I can, holdin on to what I am, pretending 
I'm a super man.
I'm trying to sleep. I lost count of sheep.
My mind is racing faster every minute.  What could
I do more? Yeah I'm really not sure. I know I'm 
running circles but I can't quit.
And I'm so confused about what to do.  
Sometimes I want to throw it all away. (kinda cut it off here)
Controlling everything in sight, I'm feeling weak I don't
feel right. You're telling me I have to change, telling me
to act my age. But if all that I can do is just sit and
watch time go, then I'll have to say goodbye. Life's too 
short to watch it fly, so watch it fly.

I profumi d'amore inebrieranno i nostri corpi,
 la bonaccia d'agosto non calmerà i nostri sensi.
Tesserò i tuoi capelli come trame di un canto.
Conosco le leggi del mondo e te ne farò dono.
Supererò le correnti gravitazionali,

You were the king of carrot flowers
And how you built a tower tumbling through the trees
In holy rattlesnakes that fell all around your feet
  And your mom would stick a fork right into daddy's shoulder
And your dad would throw the garbage all across the floor
As we would lay and learn what each other's bodies were for
  And this is the room 
One afternoon I knew I could love you
And from above you how I sank into your soul
Into that secret place where no one dares to go
  And your mom would drink until she was no longer speaking
And dad would dream of all the different ways to die
Each one a little more than he could dare to try
I love you Jesus Christ
Yes I do
I love you, Jesus Christ
Yes I do
The day we are awaiting
Up and over, we go
I will float until I learn how to swim
Inside my mother in a garbage bin
Until I find myself again, again, oh-oh
Up and over, we go
I will spit until I learn how to speak
Up through the door as the side boards creak
But I'm never proclaiming me, me, oh-oh
Up and over, we go
I will shout until they know what I mean
I mean the marriage of a dead dog sing
And a synthetic flying machine, machine, oh-oh
        Oh-oh        Oh-oh
        Oh-oh        
Okay
What a beautiful face 
I have found in this place,
that is circling all 'round the sun. 
What a beautiful dream
that could flash on the screen 
in a blink of an eye and be gone from me,
soft and sweet,
let me hold it close and keep it here with me
and one day we will die
and our ashes will fly from the aeroplane over the sea
but for now we are young
let us lay in the sun
and count every beautiful thing we can see
Love to be 
in the arms of all I'm keepin' here with me
what a curious life we have found here tonight
there is music that sounds from the street
there are lights in the cloud
Anna's ghost all around 
hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me
soft and sweet
How the notes all bend and reach above the trees
now how I remember you
how I would push my fingers through
your mouth to make those muscles move
that make your voice so smooth and sweet
And now we keep where we don't know 
All secrets sleep in winter clothes
with one you loved so long ago
What a beautiful face 
I have found in this place
that is circling all 'round the sun
and when we meet on a cloud 
I'll be laughing out loud 
I'll be laughing with everyone that I see
Can't believe how strange it is to be anything at all
Two headed boy
All floating in glass
The sun it has passed
Now it's blacker than black
I can hear as you tap on your jar
I am listening to hear where you are
I am listening to hear where you are
Two headed boy
Put on sunday shoes
And dance round the room to accordion keys
With the needle that sings in your heart
Catching signals that sound in the dark
Catching signals that sound in the dark
We will take off our clothes
And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
And when all is breaking , everything that you could keep inside
now you're eyes aint moving now, they just lay there in their cloud
Two headed boy
With pulleys and weights
Creating a radio played just for two
In the parlor with a moon across her face
And through the music he sweetly displays
Silver speakers that sparkle all day
Made for his lover who's floating and choking with her hands across her face
And in the dark we will take off our clothes
And they'll be placing fingers through the notches in your spine
And when all is breaking, everything that you could keep inside
now you're eyes ain't moving now, they just lay there in their clouououououd
Two headed boy
There's no reason to grieve 
The world that you need is wrapped in gold silver sleeves
Left beneath Christmas trees in the snow
And I will take you and leave you alone
Watching spirals of white softly flow
Over your eyelids and all you did
Will wait until the point when you let go
Dee dee dee dee dee dee du dee dee
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee
Dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee dee
       Two, one, two, three, four
The only girl I've ever loved
Was born with roses in her eyes
But then they buried her alive
One evening Nine-teen-forty-five
With just her sister at her side
And only weeks before the guns
All came and rained on everyone
Now she's a little boy in Spain
Playing pianos filled with flames
On empty rings around the sun
All sing to say my dream has come
But now we must pick up every piece
Of this life we used to love
Just to keep ourselves at least
Enough to carry on!
And now we ride the circus wheel
With your dark brother wrapped in white
Says it was good to be alive
But now he rides a comet's flame
And won't be coming back again
The Earth looks better from a star
That's right above from where you are
He didn't mean to make you cry
With sparks that ring and bullets fly
On empty rings around your heart
The world just screams and falls apart
But now we must pick up every piece
Of the life we used to love
Just to keep ourselves at least
Enough to carry on!                
And here's where your mother sleeps
And here is the room where your brothers were born
In-den-tions in the sheets
Where their bodies once moved but don't move anymore
And it's so sad to see the world agree
That they'd rather see their faces fill with flies
All when I'd want to keep white roses in their eyes

Sweet communist
Standing on the sea-weed water
Semen stains the mountain tops
semen stains the mountain tops
With cocoa leaves along the border
Sweetness sings from every corner 
Cars careening from the clouds
The bridges burst and twist around
And wanting something warm and moving
Bends towards herself the soothing 
Proves that she must still exist
She moves herself about her fist

Semen stains the mountain tops

Oh comely 
I will be with you when you lose your breath
Chasing the only meaningful memory you thought you had left
With some pretty bright and bubbly terrible scene
That was doing her thing on your chest
But oh comely 
It isn't as pretty as you'd like to guess      
It doesn't mean anything at all
Oh comely
All of your friends are letting you blow
Bristling and ugly
Bursting with fruits falling out from the holes
Of some pretty bright and bubbly friend 
You could need to say comforting things in your ear
But oh comely 
There isn't such one friend that you could find here
I'll crush him with everything I own
say what you want to say
Hang for you hollow ways moving your mouth 
to pull out all your miracles aimed for me
Your father made fetuses 
While you and your mother 
Were asleep in the trailer park
Thunderous sparks from the dark of the stadiums
The music and medicine you needed for comforting
So make all your fat fleshy fingers to moving
And pluck all your silly strings 
And bend all your notes for me
Soft silly music is meaningful magical
The movements were beautiful
All in your ovaries
All of them milking with green fleshy flowers
While powerful pistons were sugary sweet machines
Smelling of semen all under the garden
Was all you were needing when you still believed in me
Say what you wanna say and hang for your hollow ways
Moving your mouth to pull out all your miracle aimed for me

I know they buried her body with others
Her sister and mother and 500 families 
And will she remember me 50 years later
I wished I could save her in some sort of time machine

Know all your enemies 
We know who are enemies are

Ghost, ghost I know you live within me
Loved with all that was left within me
Now wings and rings and there's so many
Waiting here for you
And she was born in a bottle rocket, 1929
Right between her spine
All drenched in milk and holy water
Pouring from the sky
I know that she will live for ever
She won't ever die
She goes and now she knows she'll never be afraid
To watch the morning paper blow
Into a hole where no one can escape
Dee, de de de de...
And one day in New York City baby
Fourteen stories high
And when her spirit left her body
How it split the sun
I know that she will live for ever
She goes and now she knows she'll never be afraid
To watch the morning paper blow
Into a hole where no one can escape
Dee, de de de de...

Daddy please hear this song that I sing
In your heart there's a spark that just screams
For a lover to bring a child to your chest
that could lay as you sleep and love all you have left
like your boy used to be, long ago wrapped in sheets
warm and wet
Blister please with those wings in your spine
Love to be with a brother of mine
how he loved to find your tongue in his teeth
in a struggle to find, secret songs that you'd keep
wrapped in boxes so tight, sounding only at night
as you sleep
And in my dreams you're alive and you're crying
As your mouth moves in mine, soft and sweet
Rings of flowers round your eyes and I'll love you
For the rest of your life
Brother see we are one in the same
And you left with your head filled with flames
and you watched as your brains fell out through your teeth
push the pieces in place, make your smile sweet to see
don't you take this away, I'm still wanting my face on your cheek
And when we break, we'll wait for our miracle
God is a place where some holy spectacle lies
When we break, we'll wait for our miracle
God is a place you will wait for the rest of your life
Two headed boy
She is all you could need
She will feed you tomatoes and radio wire
And retire to sheets safe and clean
But don't hate her when she gets up to leave

Where were you when I was hurt and I was helpless
Because the things you say and the things you do surround me
While you were hanging yourself on someone else's words
Dying to believe in what you heard
I was staring straight into the shining sun
Lost in thought and lost in time
While the seeds of life and the seeds of change were planted
Outside the rain fell dark and slow
While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible pastime
I took a heavenly ride through our silence
I knew the moment had arrived
For killing the past and coming back to life
I took aheavenly ride through our silence
I knew the waiting had begun
And headed straight... Into the shining sun

They were burning babies, burning flags, the hawks against the doves
I took a job in the steamie down on Cauldrumm St,
I fell in love with a laundry girl who was workin' next to me
She was a rare thing, fine as a bee's wing
So fine a breath of wind might blow her away
She was a lost child, she was runnin' wild
She said so long as there's no price on love I'll stay
And you wouldn't want me any other way
Brown hair zig zagged around her face and look of half surprise,
Like a fox caught in the headlights there was animal in her eyes,
She said young man, oh can't you see I'm not the factory kind,
If you don't take me out of here I'll surely lose my mind
She was a rare thing, fine as a bee's wing
So fine that I might crush her where she lay
She was a lost child, she was runnin' wild
She said so long as there's no price on love I'll stay
You wouldn't want me any other way
We busked around the market towns, we picked fruit down in Kent
We could tinker lamps and pots n knives wherever we went
I said to her we'll settle down, get a few acres dug,
A fire burning in the hearth and babbies on the rug
She said Oh man, you foolish man, that surely sounds like hell,
You might be lord of half the world but you'll not own me as well
She was a rare thing, fine as a bee's wing
So fine a breath of wind might blow her away
She was a lost child, she was runnin' wild (she said)
So long as there's no price on love I'll stay
You wouldn't want me any other way
We was campin' down the Gower one time, the work was pretty good
She thought we shouldn't wait for the frost and I thought maybe we should
We were drinking more in those days, tempers reached a pitch
And like a fool I let her run with the ramblin' itch
Oh the last I heard she was sleeping rough back on the Darby beat
White Horse in her hip pocket, and a Wolfhound at her feet
They say that she married once to a man called Romany Brown
but even a gypsy caravan was too much settlin' down
They say her rose has bloomed now, hard weather and hard booze,
Maybe that's the price you pay for the chains that you refuse
She was a rare thing, fine as a bee's wing
I miss her more than words could ever say
If I could just taste all of her wildness now
If I could hold her in my arms today
I wouldn't want her any other way...

I wake up, and French kiss the morning

The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down

Step that I take is on my way home

Given each night to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time
Or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire
I'll just close my eyes, whisper

Whiskey's gone dry the barkeeper's wig's crooked
I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died, uh yeah!...
Now as you close your eyes
Know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonite, I won't be alone
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove for it's you
That I'd die to defend
I wanna lay
You down in a bed of roses
For tonite
I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh, I want to be
Just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
I wanna lay
You down in a bed of roses
For tonite
I sleep on a be...ed of nails!
I want to be
Just as close as
The Holy Ghost is!
Lay you down

44,Be Prepared,Elton John,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/elton-john/be-prepared-chords-776253,"I know that your powers of retention 
Are as wet as a warthog's backside.
But thick as you are pay attention
My words are a matter of pride.
It's clear from your vacant expressions,
The lights are not all on upstairs.
But we're talking kings, and successions,
Even YOU can't be caught unawares...
So prepare for the chance of a lifetime,
Be prepared for sensational news...
A shining new era is tip-toeing nearer
And where do we feature?
Just listen to teacher.
I know it sounds sordid,
But you'll be rewarded
When at last I am given my dues,
And injustice, deliciously squared,
Be   prepared!
Yeah, be prepared, heh, heh, 
We'll be prepared, heh.
For the death of the king!
Why, is he sick?
No fools, we're gunna kill him...
No king, no king, la la la la la la!
Idiots! There will be a king!
Hey but you said er--
Stick with me, and you'll never go hungry again!
Yay, alright! 
Yeah,alright!
Alright!
Long live the king! 
It's great that we'll soon be connected
With a king who'll be all time adored.
Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected,
To take certain duties on board...
The future is littered with prizes
And though I'm the main addressee,
The point that I must emphasize is,
YOU WON'T GET A SNIFF WITHOUT ME!
So prepare for the coup of the century
Be prepared for the murkiest scam
Meticulous planning, tenacity spanning,
Decades of denial
Is simply why I'll 
Be king undisputed,
respected, saluted,
And seen for the wonder I am.
Yes my teeth and ambitions are bared.
Be   Prepared!
Yes our teeth and ambitions are bared,
Be prepared!

me quema sin tu amor
No me has llamado
estoy desesperado
son muchas lunas
las que te he llorado
Rayando el sol,   oe oh
desesperacion
es mas facil llegar al sol
que a tu corazon
Me muero por ti , oe oh
viviendo sin  ti
y no aguanto me duele tanto
estar asi,            rayando el sol
A tu casa yo fui
y no te encontre
en el parque, en la plaza, en el cine
yo te busque
Te tengo atrapada
entre mi piel y mi alma
mas ya no puedo tanto
y quiero estar junto a ti

Like seven inches from the midday sun
Well I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My mu-equita,     my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove
And if you say this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth
Well and it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well that's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it

Well I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave I'd be a crying shame
In every breath and every word I hear your name calling me out
Well out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm on your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round and round
And if you say this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

But we're the generation that's got to be heard.
You're tired of your teachers and your school's a drag
You're not going to end up like your mum and dad

But he can't be here so come around tonight.
Here is the place where the feeling grows
You gotta get high before you taste the lows.

The odour of old prison food 
takes a long time to pass you by
Day upon day of this wandering gets you down, 
Nobody gives you a chance or a 
dollar in this old town
Hovering silence from you is a giveaway, 
Squalor and smoke's not your style
I don't like this place, We better go
Then I compare notes with your older sister, 
I am a lazy get, she is as pure 
As the cold driven snow
What did you learn from your time in the solitary 
Cell of your mind?
There was noises, distractions from anything good and the old prison food
Colour my life with the chaos of trouble
Cause anything's better than posh isolation, 
I missed the bus, You were laid on your back
With the boy with the arab strap
With the boy from the arab strap
It's something to speak of the way you are feeling 
to crowds there assembled
Do you ever feel you have gone too far?
Everyone suffers in silence a burden, 
the man who drives minicabs down in Old Compton
The Asian man With his love/hate affair with his racist clientele
A central location for you is a must as you 
stagger about making free with 
your lewd and lascivious boasts
We all know you are soft because we've all seen you dancing
We know you are hard because we all saw you drinking 
from noon until noon again
You're the boy with the filthy laugh
You're the boy with the arab strap
Strapped to the table with suits from the shelter shop
Comic celebrity takes a back seat as the 
cigarette catches and sets off the smoke alarm
What do you make of the cool set in London?
You're constantly updating your hit parade of your ten biggest wanks
She's a waitress and she's got style
Sunday bathtime could take a while

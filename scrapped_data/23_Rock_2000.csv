God who'd wanna be? God who'd wanna be such an asshole?
Well we sat on the edge of the river, the crowd screamed ""Sacrifice the liver!""

2,The Best Ever Death Metal Band In Denton,The Mountain Goats,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-mountain-goats/the-best-ever-death-metal-band-in-denton-chords-778906,"The best ever death metal band out of Denton
were a couple of guys, who'd been friends since grade school.
One was named Cyrus, and the other was Jeff
and they practiced twice a week in Jeff's bedroom.
The best ever death metal band out of Denton
         never settled on a name.
But the top three contenders, after weeks of debate,
were Satan's Fingers, and The Killers, and The Hospital Bombers.
Jeff and cyrus believed in their hearts they were headed
for stage lights and Learjets, and fortune and fame.
So in script that made prominent use of a pentagram,
they stenciled their drumheads and guitars with their names.
This was how Cyrus got sent to the school 
where they told him he'd never be famous.
And this was why Jeff, 
in the letters he'd write to his friend,
helped develop a plan to get even.
When you punish a person for dreaming his dream,
don't expect him to thank or forgive you.
The best ever death metal band out of Denton
will in time both outpace and outlive you.
Hail Satan! Hail Satan tonight!
Hail Satan! Hail, hail!

And you’re someone who knows someone who knows someone I once knew
And I just want to be a part of this
The road outside my house is paved with good intentions
Hired a construction crew, 'cause it's hell on the engine 
You are the dreamer and we are the dream.
So hum hallelujah,
I thought I loved you
It was just how you looked in the light.
A teenage vow in a parking lot
""Till tonight do us part""
I sing the blues and swallow them too
My words are my faith to hell with our good name.
A remix of your guts-your insides X-rayed
And one day we'll get nostalgic for disaster
we're a bull, your ears are just a china shop
I love you in the same way, there's a chapel in a hospital
One foot in your bedroom and one foot out the door
Sometimes we take chances, sometimes we take pills.
So hum hallelujah,
I thought I loved you
It was just how you looked in the light.
A teenage vow in a parking lot
""Till tonight do us part""

As our December sun is setting,
No longer easy on the eyes
But these wrinkles masterfully disguise,
The youthful boy below...
  Who turned your way and saw
Something he was not looking for:
  But now he lives inside
Someone he does not recognize,
When he catches his reflection on accident
  On the back of a motor bike
With your arms outstretched trying to take flight
  But even at our swiftest speed
We couldn't break from the concrete
In the city where we still reside...
  And I have learned
That even landlocked lovers yearn 
  Cause now we say goodnight
From our own separate sides,
Like brothers on a hotel bed...

Put your hand in mine

I would never make you blue

Kiss me down by the broken tree house
Swing me upon its hanging tire
Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map

But I don’t really like you
Apologetically dressed in the best, but on a heartbeat glide
Without an answer, the thunder speaks from the sky
And on the cold, wet dirt I cry
And on the cold, wet dirt I cry
Don’t you wanna come with me?
Don’t you wanna feel my bones on your bones?
It’s only natural
This cinematic vision ensued
Like the holiest dream
There’s someone calling, an angel whispers my name
But the message relayed is the same
Wait till tomorrow you’ll be fine
But it’s gone to the dogs in my mind
I Always hear them when the dead of night comes calling
To save me from this fright
But they can never wrong this right

Whistle 'Didn't He Ramble'
Now there's a bubble of me
And it's flowing in thee
Stand in the shade of me
Things are now made of me
The weather vane will say...
It smells like rain today
God took the stars and he tossed 'em
Can't tell the birds from the blossoms
You'll never be free of me
He'll make a tree from me
Don't say goodbye to me
Describe the sky to me
And if the sky falls, mark my words
We'll catch mocking birds

Hold the earth above me
Lay down in the green grass

This night you go home alone
How the sane go upright
How do you look another night.
You're back under my hat
And even knowing that you're a whore.
Nothing ever meant more
Than switching rooms through a door
Out into another one
Frames flash inward.
And you know
I have seen the world
Enough
I've drowned in my thoughts a lot
Deep in rains that swirl above
I canceled heaven I concede
Another word to say
When everything's O.K you go down.
And pulling up the slack
And never coming back
An alarm.
Ringing to set the sun
No one ever becomes
What others thought they should've been
Inside they're what they can see, You know.
You know I do miss this girl
To show I am in a swirl of sun
Being what I've got
The joy
I canceled heaven I concede
Everything that I believe
I canceled heaven I concede

Me callo porque es más cómodo engañarse.
Me callo porque ha ganado la razón al corazón.

y aunque otro me acompañe,
en silencio te querré tan sólo a tí.
Igual que el mendigo cree que el cine es un escaparate,
igual que una flor resignada decora un despacho elegante,
prometo llamarle amor mío al primero que no me haga daño
y reir será un lujo que olvide cuando te haya olvidado.
Pero igual que se espera como esperan en la Plaza de Mayo
procuro encender en secreto una vela no sea que por si acaso
un golpe de suerte algún día quiera que te vuelva a ver
reduciendo estas palabras a un trozo de papel.
Me callo porque es más cómodo engañarse.
Me callo porque ha ganado la razón al corazón,

And then came the rush of the flood
Stars of night turned deep to dust

  Hard    Rock   Hallelu - jah!
  The saints are crippled
On this sinners' night
 Lost are the lambs with no guiding light
The walls come down like thunder
The rocks about to roll
 It's The Arockalypse
Now bare your soul
All we need is lightning    
With power and might
Striking down the prophets of false
As the moon is rising
Give us the sign
 Now let us rise up in awe
Rock 'n roll angels bring thyn Hard Rock Hallelujah
  Demons and angels all in one have arrived
Rock 'n roll angels bring thyn Hard Rock Hallelujah
  In God's creation supernatural high
  Wings on my back
I got horns on my head
  My fangs are sharp
And my eyes are red
  Not quite an angel
The one that fell
 Now choose to join us or go straight to Hell

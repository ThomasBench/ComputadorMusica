Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free
I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
Saw the lights go down and standing in front of me
       In my scarecrow dreams
When they smash my heart into smithereens
e a bright red rose come bursting the concrete
Be a cartoon heart
Light a fire, a fire, a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart
We'll run wild
We'll be glowing in the dark
All the boys, all the girls
All that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls
All the madness that occurs
All the highs, all the lows
As the room a-spinning, goes
We'll run riot
We'll be glowing in the dark
So we'll soar
  Luminous and wired
We'll be glowing in the dark

you; like when your teeth graze those lips, when you begin to smile. 
   Later, you took my hand.   You lead us to the door-
way, but you let go of me    once you saw all your 
friends. And I've known you forever.   At least that's what I tell Jake, 
when I'm too drunk to walk home, when your brother is a-
way. You suggested I write a song about the first time we met, 
   but I can't seem to remember where or when. 
   Couldn't watch your ex's set.   Instead I wrote this song about 
you. Thought, ""would you show your kids, if you found the time was right?"" 
   You'd tell them where and when. You never thought I'd leave the east 
coast. We were young and full of sin. And I too dumb to understand. 
   Yet I've loved you forever. At least that's what I tell Holt, 
when I'm too drunk to lie, too drugged to be alone. 
   You suggested I write a song about the first time we met, 
   well I don't wanna remember there or then. 
   So, is this the hook you wanted? Is it 
stuck inside your head? Can you sing it with your friends, or alone? 
   So, am I what you needed? Say you love 
me to my face, grin and gossip, walk away and then go... 
   ""So is this the hook you wanted? To sing about 
me to my friends? Well you're just stuck inside your head, all alone. 
Oh, you were all I needed. Said I loved 
you to your face, but you just laughed and walked away.""

You let me keep you entertained
With stories I exaggerate
That you know aren't true
And as you sit there making daisy chains
And I throw in a hand grenade
And tell you how it is I really feel for you

With love for a postmark and then...

Like kids in the school yard again

Can't spell it any better

I don't care who sees what I sent
We chased the sun til it got away
On a bicycle that your daddy made
But not made for two
Then we sat out on your rocking chair
You with a flower in your hair
That I found for you
But then Monday always comes around
And it's sad 'cause I can't see you now
Want you to know you're always in my head
I'm sending postcards from my heart

The things that I can't say out loud
I'll find a place to write it down
I hope that they will find you in the end
I'm sending postcards from my heart

det är ljus över stränder och näs,
och omkring mig står den härliga skogen så grön
bakom ängarnas gungande gräs.
Och med sommar och skönhet och skogsvindsackord
står min hembygd och hälsar mig glad,
var mig hälsad, men var är min faders gård,
det är tomt bakom lönnarnas rad.
Det är tomt, det är bränt, det är härjat och kalt,
där den låg, ligger berghällen bar,
men där övergår minnet med vinden så svalt,
och det minnet är allt som är kvar.
Och det är jag som såg en gavel stå vit
och ett fönster stå öppet däri,
som piano det ljöd och en munter bit
av en visa med fin melodi.
Och det är, som det vore min faders röst,
när han ännu var lycklig och ung,
innan sången blev tyst i hans dödssjuka bröst
och hans levnad blev sorgsen och tung.
Det är tomt, det är bränt, jag vill lägga mig ned
invid sjön för att höra hans tal
om det gamla, som gått, medan tiden led,
om det gamla i Alsterns dal.
Och sitt sorgsna och sorlande svar han slår,
men så svagt, som det blott vore drömt:
""Det är kastat för vind sedan tjugo långa år,
det är dött och begravet och glömt.
Där du kära gestalter och syner minns,
där står tomheten öde och kal,
och min eviga vaggsång är allt som finns kvar
av det gamla i Alsterns dal.""

Passed the wondering eyes of the ones that were left behind

It's my mind that's wrong
And I just let bad thoughts
Linger for far too long

13,Nieznajomy,Dawid Podsiadło,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/1919571,"Witaj nieznajomy, pytanie do ciebie mam.
Czy zdążę jeszcze wrócić, drogi dawno już zasypał czas.
Za oknem cisza, najcichsza jaką znam.
Taka przed burzą, co zrywa dach.
Witaj nieznajomy, nawet nie wiem jak na imię masz.
Patrzę na ciebie i myślę: czy to ja za kilka lat?
Za oknem szarość wchodzi w czerń
Ty wciąż nie mówisz do mnie nic.
Na tym pustkowiu mieszka śmierć
Czy to tylko część mojego snu?
Powiedz mi
Ściany się burzą, szyby pękają na raz
Lecę w dół przez błędy wszystkich lat
Widzę wyraźnie pełne rozczarowań twarze
A w oczach ból i gniew uśpionych zdarzeń
Kłamałem więcej niż kiedykolwiek chciałbym przyznać,
A w moich żyłach płynęła krew zimniejsza niż stal.
Dlatego dzisiaj jestem całkiem sam
Mój nieznajomy, czy widzisz to co ja?
Jak to możliwe, ze ktokolwiek ufał mi?
Pozornie szczery, lecz nigdy tak jak dziś.
To samo miejsce, ten sam zmęczony strach.
Wśród tłumu ludzi odbijam się od dna.
Żegnaj nieznajomy, już nie chcę twoich rad

Of that I'm sure
People killing people dying
Children hurtin you hear them crying 
Can you practice what you preach
Forever young
I want to be forever young
I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait 
I'm Yours
Your lipstick stains on the front lobe of my left side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
And can you feel the love tonight
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter no
Country roads, take me home
To the place 
I belong
I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-Paparazzi
I can't live
With or without you
Pictures of you, pictures of me
Hung upon your wall for the world to see
And she will be loved
She will be loved
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
No, woman, no cry   
Yeah, Mama this surely is a dream
I come from a land down under
Red, white and blue all the funny things you do
America, America, This is you
They say Taylor was a good girl
never one to be late
complain express ideas in her brain
I need some love like
I never needed love before
Wanna make love to ya baby
Take on me
When I come around
Take me on
When I come around
I'll be gone 
When I'm on take
Save tonight
Its gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
and fight the break of dawn come tomorrow
Theres nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
In my head
I see you all over me.
In my head, you fulfill my fantasy.
Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage
What if God was one of us
Tell me: Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?
I see the way you're
Actin like you're somebody
I Know she's playin with me, but thats ok coz I got no self esteem
With a 1,000 eyes and a great disguise I'll look em right between the eyes
hit them right between the eyes 
'cause You're so beautiful
So damn beautiful
It's too late to apologize
It's too late
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
Can't read my, can't read my
No he can't read my poker face 
Come on Barbie, let's go party!
How long how long will I slide
Separate my 
Double rainbow all the way 'cross the sky
Yeah, Yeah, so intense
Control yourself
Take only what you need from him
A family of trees wanting
Time to say goodbye
Veduto e vissuto con te
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
and never brought to mind?
I'm more than a bird
I'm more than a plane
I'm a birdplane, I'm a birdplane
A mother fuckin' birdplane
And doesn't that sound familiar?
Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver?
The way things could have gone.
And doesn't it feel peculiar,
When everyone wants a little more?
So that I do remember to never go this far
That's all it takes to be a STAR!!

Wenn du duschen gehst
Und dann vor mir stehst
Und sagst, es wird ein langer Tag
Und wenn du mich dann fragst
Was wir heut Abend machen
Und wir zwischen Küssen lachen
Dann merk ich, es ist leicht
Weil dir so wenig reicht
Du gibst mir Zeit
  Und dann denk ich, dass es vielleicht, vielleicht
  Für immer so bleibt
  Und dann denk ich, dass es vielleicht, vielleicht
  Für immer so bleibt
  Ja, es ist leicht, leicht, leicht, leicht
  Ja, es ist leicht, leicht, leicht, leicht
Weil du siehst was ich sonst niemandem zeige
Ich kann dir erzählen was ich mir selbst verschweige
Und ich will, dass es für immer so bleibt
Und ich glaube, das geht

Hit me without warning
I went to hear the general speak
I was standing for the anthem
Banners all around him
Confetti made it hard to see
Put my footsteps on the pavement
Starved for entertainment
Four seasons of revolving doors
So sick of being honest
I'll die like Dylan Thomas
A seizure on the barroom floor
I’m getting greedy with this private hell
I'll go it alone, but that's just as well
These cats are scared and feral
The flag pins on their lapels
The truth is anybody’s guess
These talking heads are saying
""The king is only playing
a game of four dimensional chess""
There's flowers in the rubble
The weeds are gonna tumble
I'm lucid but I still can't think
I'm strapped into a corset
Climbed into your corvette
I'm thirsty for another drink
If it's advertised, we'll try it
And buy some peace and quiet
And shut up at the silent retreat
They say you’ve gotta fake it
At least until you make it
That ghost is just a kid in a sheet
I’m getting used to these dizzy spells
I'm taking a shower at the Bates Motel
I’m getting greedy with this private hell
I'll go it alone, but that's just as well

Sitting drunk on the sidewalk

There ain't no other good damn reason why

Until the sky bleeds the pouring rain
When you came along the time was right
Pulled me like an apple red and ripe
Wasn’t very long you took a bite
And did me wrong -and it serves me right

Every little key unlocks the door
Every little secret has a lie
Try to take a picture of the sun
And it wont help you to see the light
Every little word upon your lips
Makes a little cut where blood pours out
Every little drop of blood I kiss
That I won’t miss -not for anything

[Verse]    i was just guessing at numbers and f--igures, pulling the puzzles apart
           questions of science, science and pr-ogress, do not speak as loud as my heart
           tell me you love me, come back and ha-unt me, oh and i rush to the start
           running in circles, chasing t-ails, coming back as we are
[Chorus]   nobody said it was easy,  oh it's such a shame for us to part
           nobody said it was easy,  no-one ever said it would be so hard
           i'm going back to the start

And slow movin freight trains
Girl thats how
You make me feel sometimes
But you were gone away from here
So far my dear
Up by
That northern state line
Virginia
Light up my broken dreams
You pick me up
And you sure make me smile
Virginia
I would give anything
So come dance around
My memory for a while
Off in the moonlight,
Sweet southern moonlight
A billion stars,
Bare feet in the sand
Im countin down the summer days
Smiling at our reckless ways
You was my girl
And I was your man
Virginia
Light up my broken dreams
You pick me up
And you sure make me smile
Virginia
I would give anything
So come dance around
My memory for a while
Thats the way the story goes
Of broken hearts and sad souls
You left me here
Not saying goodbye
Said you headed with your paw
North Arkansas
But that was back before
1975
Virginia
Light up my broken dreams
You pick me up
And you sure make me smile
Virginia
I would give anything
So come dance around
My memory for a while

And all we know, is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
Or fades in time
And I never (never), saw you coming
And I'll never, be the same
 You come around and the armor falls
Now all we know... is don't let go
We are alone just you and me
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
So you were never a saint 
But this love is brave and wild
And I never (never), saw you coming
And I'll never, be the same
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something 
And I never (never), saw you coming
And I'll never, be the same
I never (never), saw you coming
And I'll never, be the same
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

Everything was fine, until you came around
And I’ve been chasing after dreamers in the clouds
After all wasn’t I the one who said
To keep your feet on the ground
Hold onto hope if you got it
Don’t let it go for nobody
And they say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn’t care what it cost me
You got me tied up but I stay close to the window
And I talk to myself about the places that I used to go
I'm hoping someday maybe I'll just float away
And I'll forget every cynical thing you say
When you gonna hear me out
Hold onto hope if you got it
Don’t let it go for nobody
And they say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn’t care what it cost me
      Reality will break your heart
      Survival will not be the hardest part 
  It’s keeping all your hopes alive
  When all the rest of you has died
Hold onto hope if you got it
Don’t let it go for nobody
Hold onto hope if you got it
Don’t let it go for nobody
And they say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me

0,Friendly Fire,Holly Humberstone,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/holly-humberstone/friendly-fire-chords-3947267,"We had a mutual friend who played cupid
You jumped in the bed and been there ever since
Teenage affection is often confusing
I'm starting to feel like it's wearing thin
Darling, I don't remember how I'm supposed
To feel at your place, when we're watching TV
And if you start to wonder why
I just stare into space, when you're talking to me
You were there, where was I?
Know that somewhere down the line
If I hurt you, it's just friеndly fire
Well, it happens all thе time, guess I'm broken by design
If I burn you, it's all friendly fire
We had a shelf life but neither believed it
We just gave up reading the signs
I make conversation to fill every silence
Then put on my headphones and cry
It's been a cold December
God knows that I've been a stain
Oh, it's me, I know
But you're making plans forever
But God knows if I'm gonna stay or if I'd rather be alone
You were there, where was I?
Know that somewhere down the line
If I hurt you, it's just friendly fire
Well, it happens all the time, guess I'm broken by design
If I burn you, it's all friendly fire

Set the plates, pour the tea

Sleepily, she walks
Gradually, she talks
With the geese, she flocks

Afternoon, Midnight
Morning's what she likes
Fly the broom, see the moon
Dried roses
Here I go, there I am
All alone in the pan
In the silence again
Dried roses
Half dead, half awake
Make a pie, bake a cake
Which road will you take?

Goodness eternity
Out you go, in you be

  And I don't stop to think, I don't catch my breath

 I know them all like the back of my hand
And I don't know,  How to figure out where to go
From here
  And now I'm alone on this island
  I drink so I don't think of you, oh oh
  And now I'm alone
  I don't know if this was the right thing to do
  Where do I go without you?
  I wanna tell you I miss you
  But that contradicts what I told you before
   I wanna tell you I love you

It was eaten from the core and out to the skin, and that’s why you'll never find the worm in it
But a few bad ones won't spoil the eyes if they fall far enough from the tree
The rind is all you see
Leave Eden with my seeds in your stomach
Well this disease is defined by its treatment, you people make me sick
Parlance of imbalanced cambia’s been challenged, at best AstraZeneca's just theoretical
Prints of your fingers in the Rorschach jigsaw, say you saw a treasure map
Straight-jacket and tie, psychiatric supply, while we tragically try to fit into a trap, but
Who'd want to be human anyway?
Who pilots all these crude machines?
Why'd you come into this world or come out that way?
Like freaks of nurture?
Well isn't it funny? (Well not ha-ha funny but y'know, funny)
'Cause I doubt that you would even if you could change
You think it makes you special, but it makes you strange
I doubt that you would even if you could change
The things that make you special are the things that make you strange
I am the shadows cast aside by gallows, and you the red-hot sky
And if you're believers, then why would you grieve for the
Dead, instead of a devil that you never prayed for?
You become immune to my toxic fumes, my dose-dependent presence in your life
It’s all subjective, all due respect to the collective mind, but
Too weird to love, too scared to die
Too alien to take you home
Horrified at the sight of my reflection in your eyes
I don’t belong there
Well, it's your conclusions that make mine delusions, so I make you sane
I doubt that you would even if you could change
You think it makes you special, but it makes you strange
I doubt that you would even if you could change
The things that make you special are the things that make you strange
Who’d want to belong to anyone?
I mean, what do people even do?
So if you love me, let me let you go, my love
So I can be no one
When Chuang-Tzu awoke he sat up, almost choking, spat out a butterfly and said
I mean you were there, and you were there, and you, and you, and you were there…
'Cause I doubt that you would even if you could change
You think it makes you special, but it makes you strange
I doubt that you would even if you could change
The things that make you special are the things that make you
I doubt that you would even if you could change
You think it makes you special, but it makes you strange

Tied by a monster and his oblivious wife

But Ted Bundy was just never that fuckin’ bright
He was just sorta charismatic and white, alright?
But he's ugly, and I’m glad he’s dead
'Cause he had no fuckin’ candle in his pumpkin head

She had every right
Y’ just caught her off guard tonight
But it’s alright
She’ll be fine

They found their body but not their eyes

In my mind you're mine forever
If you're ever gonna leave this place
Don't wait, it's time to go
If you really wanna stay
I'll go alone
If you tell me where to meet and
Then I'll wait 'til I turn to bone
Oh, we really should've left here long ago
Love is strange
I can't sleep without you
Maybe in the grave
I can dream about you
Worry bout' the lies
But I'd never doubt you
Don't wanna die
But I can't live without you
I'm much too young to die
So long, good luck, goodbye
We will always be together

Of separate strands of fishing line
 Attached to coarse behavior it flowed
A calm it urged—what else is here?

To linger in tones and words?
 I opened the floodgates and found no water, no current, no river, no rush

To captivate every heart?
 Projеcting your visions to strangers who feel it, who listen, who linger on еvery word

 All alone I feel so much
 I want my offering to woo, to calm, to clear, to solve

It calls, it screams—there’s nothing here!

Locking lips and braces, brackets

Sweaty palms, averted eyes
Wasn't sure if he and I were going out
Going out
Going out, ooh
Going, going, out
The sunset threw a tantrum
It wasn't ready to go just yet
Mother Earth said, ""Time for bed""
It resisted and the sky went red
The color filterеd out
Like pulling teeth out of a cloud
The bloody battle еnded
No, the sun can't break the habit of going down
Going down
Going down, ooh
Going, going, down

Grabbing asses, spilling beers
Another ten and he'll have a daughter

Watching the day end hand in hand

Crying like a child
Still bugs me now

Makes you hurt the ones who love you

You hurt them like they're nothing
You hurt them like they're nothing

is a quiet thing
You think that you've tamed it
But it's lying in wait
Rage...
Is it in our veins?
Feel it in my face when,
when I least expect it
Control.. There's so many ways to give in
Eyes.. closed Another way to make it to ten
Oh, how to draw the line between wrath and mercy?
Gotta simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer down
Control.. There's so many ways to give in
Eyes.. closed Another way to make it to ten
Oh, how to draw the line between wrath and mercy?
Gotta simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer down
If I had seen my reflection
As something more precious
He would've never
Mmm, and if my child needed protection
From a fucker like that man
I'd sooner gut him
'Cause nothing cuts like a mother
Control.. There's so many ways to give in
Eyes.. closed Another way to make it to ten
Oh, how to draw the line between wrath and mercy?
Gotta simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer down
Control.. There's so many ways to give in
Eyes.. closed Another way to make it to ten
Oh, how to draw the line between wrath and mercy?
Gotta simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer down
Simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer down
Wrap yourself in petals
Wrap yourself in petals
Wrap yourself in petals for armor
Petals for armor
Control.. There's so many ways to give in
Eyes.. closed Another way to make it to ten
Oh, how to draw the line between wrath and mercy?
Gotta simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer down
Control.. There's so many ways to give in
Eyes.. closed Another way to make it to ten
Oh, how to draw the line between wrath and mercy?
Gotta simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer, simmer down

running through my yard
like a wild stream
  Just a little kid blood
flowing into my rosy cheeks
  Now a river runs red from
my knuckles into the sink
  And there’s a pale girl
staring through the mirror at
me Maybe it’s just a dream
  Wish I could go back to sleep
  Hydrangeas blooming of the
branches of park trees
  It’s a half-hearted calm
the way I’ve felt since
I was thirteen
  Cause I may not feel it now
covered up the wounds with my
long sleeves
  but I know it’s waiting there
swimming through my bloodstream
  and it’s gonna come for me
  yeah it’s gonna come for me
  What did you have that
I didn’t? and why am I
so   blue? someone’s talking
in my forehead that says
I’ll never be like you
happiness is like a firefly
on summer evenings feel it
slipping through my fingers
but I can’t catch it in
my hands catch it in my
  Old memories ribbons running
down from my bare knees
  I ran too fast fell down
on my face in the concrete
  I guess the lesson’s learned
I’ve barely left my room in
the past week
  And I’ve got my guard up trying
all the time to stay clean
  But I don’t feel anything
  I don’t feel anything
  What did you have that I
didn’t? and why am I so   fucked?
There’s someone talking in my
forehead that says I’ll never
be e----nough and happiness
is like a firefly on summer
evenings feel it slipping
through my fingers but I
can’t catch it in my
hands catch it in my

Every once in a million seconds on a broken clock
Yet we talk like we're living
Only miles, only minutes from another just around the block
As I stare at my screen, shining blue and green
All alone in a coffee shop
I can't help but imagine what maybe could've happened
If you weren't just an online love

To have six years behind us in waiting
Not but a shadow remains
Well, you took what was left worth taking
This is only begun
I, I do not know
If I could just
Grow into love with you
If you could grow, too
I have to get out of this place
But instead I'm at peace with staying
Oh, we both come and go as we please
Well, I guess that’s the game that we're playing
This is only begun
I, I do not know
If I could just
Grow into love with you
If you could grow, too
I came to my senses alone
In the bed where my eyes was lying
It was there that my thoughts turned to you
Waylaid by the light that was dying
And was backed by the wails of a siren
This is only begun
I, I do not know
If I could just
Grow into love with you
If you could grow, too
This is only begun
I, I do not know
If I could just
Grow into love with you

0,Meet Me On The Corner,Lindisfarne,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lindisfarne/meet-me-on-the-corner-chords-74204,"Hey Mister Dreamseller where have you been,
Tell me have you dreams I can see?
I came a-long just to bring you this song,
Can you spare one dream for me?
You won't have met me and you'll soon forget,
So don't mind me tugging at your sleeve,
I'm asking you if I can fix a rendezvous,
For your dreams are all I believe.
Meet me on the corner when the lights are coming on
And I'll be there, I promise I'll be there,
Down the empty streets we'll disappear into the dawn,
If you have dreams enough to
share
Lay down your bundles of rags and reminders
And spread your wares on the ground,
Well I've got time if you're dealing rhyme,
I'm just hanging around.
Meet me on the corner when the lights are coming on
And I'll be there, I promise I'll be there,
Down the empty streets we'll disappear into the dawn,
If you have dreams enough to
share
Hey Mister Dreamseller where have you been,
Tell me have you dreams I can see?
I came a-long just to bring you this song,
Can you spare one dream for
Me?

And welcome me back to town
Come out on your porch or I'll step into your parlor
And I'll show you how it all went down
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town
Oh and I remembered something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all led me straight back home to you
`Cause I headed West to grow up with the country
Across those prairies with those waves of grain
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee
We flew straight across that river bridge, last night half past two
Switchman wave his lantern goodbye and good day as we went rolling through
Billboards and truck stops pass by the grievous angel
And now I know just what I have to do
And the man on the radio won't leave me alone
He wants to take my money for something that I've never been shown
And I saw my devil, and I saw my deep blue sea
And I thought about a calico bonnet from Cheyenne to Tennessee
The news I could bring I met up with the king
On his head an amphetamine crown
He talked about unbuckling that old bible belt
And lighted out for some desert town
Out with the truckers and the kickers and the cowboy angels
And a good saloon in every single town
Oh but I remembered something you once told me
And I'll be damned if it did not come true
Twenty thousand roads I went down, down, down
And they all led me straight back home to you

But I've seen your self-pity showing
As the tears rolled down your cheeks.
Soon you know I'll leave you
And I'll never look behind
'Cos I was born for the purpose

Giving substance to shadows
Giving substance ever more.

Secrets shiny and new

Twenty red lights in his honor Thank you Jesus, thank you lord
I had an arrangement to meet a girl, and I was kind of late
And I thought by the time I got there she'd be off
She'd be off with the nearest truck driver she could find
Much to my surprise, there she was sittin in the corner
A little bleary, worse for wear and tear
Was a girl with far away eyes
So if you're down on your luck
And you can't harmonize   (2ND TIME: I KNOW YOU ALL SYMPATHIZE)
Find a girl with far away EYES
And if you're downright disgusted
And life ain't worth a dime
Get a girl with far away eyes
Well the preacher kept right on saying that all I had to do was send
Ten dollars to the church of the sacred bleeding heart of Jesus
Located somewhere in Los Angeles, California
And next week they'd say my prayer on the radio
And all my dreams would come true
So I did, the next week, I got a prayer with a girl

Stolen my heart
Changed my life
Everytime you make a move
You destroy my mind
And the way you touch
I lose control and shiver deep inside
You take my breath away.
You can reduce me to tears
With a single sigh
Every breath that you take -
Any sound that you make
Is a whisper in my ear
I could give up all my life
for just one kiss
I would surely die
If you dismiss me from your love
You take my breath away.
So please don't go
Don't leave me here all by myself
I get ever so lonely from time to time
I will find you
Anywhere you go, I'll be right behind you
Right until the ends of the earth

I Love You.

All of the faces and all of the places
Wonderin' where they all disappeared
I didn't ponder the question too long
I was hungry and went out for a bite
Ran into a chum with a bottle of rum
and we wound up drinkin' all night
It's those changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes
Nothing remains quite the same
With all of our running and all of our cunning
If we couldn't laugh we would all go insane
Reading departure signs in some big airport
Reminds me of the places I've been
Visions of good times that brought so much pleasure
Makes me want to go back again
If it suddenly ended tomorrow
I could somehow adjust to the fall
Good times and riches and son of a bitches
I've seen more than I can recall
These changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes
Nothing remains quite the same
Through all of the islands and all of the highlands
If we couldn't laugh we would all go insane
I think about Paris when I'm high on red wine
I wish I could jump on a plane
So many nights I just dream of the ocean
God, I wish I was sailin' again
Oh, yesterday's over my shoulder
So I can't look back for too long
There's just too much to see waiting in front of me
And I know that I just can't go wrong
With these changes in latitudes, changes in attitudes

John Barleycorn must die.

threw clods at Barley's head
And these three men made a solemn vow:
John Barleycorn was dead.
They've let him lie for a very long time,
‘till the rains from heaven did fall
And little Sir John sprung up his head,
and so amazed them all.
They've let him stand ‘till midsummer's day,
‘till he looked both pale and wan
And little Sir John's grown a long, long beard,
and so become a man.
They've hired men with the scythes so sharp,
to cut him off at the knee
They've rolled him and tied him by the waist,
servin' him most barbarously.
They've hired men with the sharp pitchforks,
who pricked him to the heart
And the loader he has served him worse than that,
for he's bound him to the cart
They've wheeled him around and around the field,
‘till they came unto a barn
And there they made a solemn oath,
on poor John Barleycorn.
They've hired men with the crab-tree sticks,
to cut him skin from bone
And the miller he has served him worse than that,
for he's ground him between two stones.
And little Sir John and the nut-brown bowl,
and he's brandy in the glass
And little Sir John and the nut-brown bowl,
proved the strongest man at last.

And the tinker he can't mend kettle nor pots,

While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing
Distant ships sailing into the mist
You were born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was 
Freedom just around the corner for you
But with truth so far off, what good will it do.
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky
You rise up and say goodbye to no one
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
Both of their futures, so full of dread, you don't show one
Shedding off one more layer of skin
Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within.
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
You're a man of the mountain, you can walk on the clouds
Manipulator of crowds, you're a dream twister
You're going to Sodom and Gomorrah
But what do you care ? Ain't nobody there would want marry your sister
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the woman of shame
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name.
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers
In the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed
Michelangeo indeed could've carved out your features
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space
Half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face.
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
Well, the rifleman's stalking the sick and the lame
Preacherman seeks the same, who'll get there first is uncertain 
Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks
Molotow cocktails and rocks behind every curtain
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin
Only a matter of time 'til the night comes stepping in.
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman.
It's a shadowy world, skies are slippery gray
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet
He'll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat
Take the motherless children off the street
And place them at the feet of a harlot
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants
Oh, Jokerman, you don't show any response.

49,My Way (ver 2),Elvis Presley,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/elvis-presley/my-way-chords-794755,"And now the end is near, 
and so I face the final curtain,
My friend, I'll say it clear, 
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full,	
I traveled each	and every highway,
And more, much more than this, I did it	my way
Regrets, I've had a few,	 
but then again, too few to mention,
I did what I had to do,
and saw it thru without exemption, 	
I planned each chartered course, 
each carefull step along the by way
And more,  much more than this, I did it  my way
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew,
when I bit off  more than I could chew,
But thru it all, when there was dout, 
I ate it up, and spit it out
I faced it  all, and I stood tall, and did it my way
I've loved, I've laughed and cried,
I've had my fill, my share of losing
And now,  as tears subside, 
I find it all so amusing
To think I did all that, 
and may I say,	""Not in a shy way""
Oh no, 	oh no, 	not me,	 I did it my way
For what is a man, what has he got, 
if not himself, then he has not 
To say the things he truly feels, 
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows, and did it my way
The record shows I took the blows, and did it my way

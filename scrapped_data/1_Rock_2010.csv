but it's so cold and I don't know where
I brought you daffodils, on a pretty string,
but they won't flower like they did last spring
And I wanna kiss you, make you feel alright,
but I'm just so tired to share my nights
I wanna cry and I wanna love
But all my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up,
on another love, another love
All my tears have been used up,
on another love, another love
All my tears have been used uuuhuuuhuuup
Ooohoooh
And if somebody hurts you, yeah I wanna fight,
but my hands been broken one too many times
So I use my voice, I'll be so fucking rude
Words they always win, but I know I'll lose
And Id sing a song that would be just ours,
but I sang them all to another heart
And I wanna cry I wanna learn to love,
but all my tears have been used up
On another love, another love
All my tears have been used up,
on another love, another love
All my tears have been used up,
on another love, another love
All my tears have been used uuuhuuuhuuup ah

I wanna sing a song that would be just ours,
but I sang them all to another heart
And I wanna cry I wanna fall in love,
but all my tears have been used up
On another love, another love

Oh, I cannot explain what's goin' down
I can see you standin' next to me
In and out somewhere else right now
You sigh   look away
I can see it clear as day
Close your eyes    so afraid
Hide behind that baby face
Doot do do, doot-do do
   You can drive   all night
Looking for the answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find   peace of mind
Lookin' for the answer
 Funny how it seems like yesterday
As I recall you were lookin' out of place
Gathered up your things and slipped away
No time at all I followed you into the hall
Cigarette daydream
You were only seventeen
So sweet with a mean streak
Nearly brought me to my knees
Doot do do, doot-do do
   You can drive    all night
Lookin' for the answers in the pouring rain
You wanna find   peace of mind
Lookin' for the answer
  If we could find a reason, a reason to change
Lookin' for the answer
  If you can find a reason, a reason to stay
Standin' in the pourin' rain

Swing my heart across the line

  A broken man, but I don't know
  Won't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul
What we doin'? What we chasin'?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?
You on the wrong way track from the good
I want to paint a picture tellin' where we could be at
Like a heart in the best way should
You can give it away, ya had it and you took the bait

Keep rockin' dawns

Have the time of your life
Breakin' through the atmosphere
Remember everything will be alright
We could meet again somewhere.

running from the bullets
The bullets...

Stop your crying, baby

We gotta get away from here

Why are we always stuck and
running from the bullets
The bullets...
  We never learn we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and
running from the bullets
The bullets...
 We don't talk enough
  We should open up
 Before it's all too much
 Will we ever learn
 We've been here before
 It's just what we know
Stop your crying, baby
Itâs a sign of the times
We gotta get away
We got to get away
We got to get away
We got to get away
We got to get away
Away!
Away!

10,Somebody That I Used To Know (verÂ 2),Gotye,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/gotye/somebody-that-i-used-to-know-chords-1094597,"  Now and then I think of when we were together
  Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
  Told myself that you were right for me
  But felt so lonely in your company
  But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
  Like resignation to the end
Always the end
  So when we found that we could not make sense
  Well you said that we would still be friends
  But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
  But you didn't have to cut me off
  Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
  You didn't have to stoop so low
  Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
  Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
  But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
  And I don't wanna live that way
  Reading into every word you say
  You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...
  But you didn't have to cut me off
  Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
  You didn't have to stoop so low
  Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody   (I used to know)
Somebody (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)
Somebody   (I used to know)
Somebody (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)
       I used to know

Gin and tonic from a can to ease the pain

14,Castle On The Hill,Ed Sheeran,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ed-sheeran/castle-on-the-hill-chords-1928433,"  When I was six years old I broke my leg
  And I was running  from my brother and his friends
  And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as I rolled down
  I was younger  then,  take me back to when I
  Found my heart and broke it here
  Made friends and lost them through the years
  And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
  But I can't wait to go home
  I'm on my   way, driving at ninety
  Down those country  lanes singing to Tiny Dancer
  And I miss the  way you make  me feel      and it's real
  When we watched the  sunset over the castle on the hill
  Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
  Running from the law through the backfields and  getting drunk with my friends
  Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon I did it
Right, I was younger  then,  take me back to when we found
  Weekend jobs and when we got paid
  We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
  Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
  But I can't wait to go home
  I'm on my   way, driving at ninety
  Down those country  lanes singing to Tiny Dancer
  And I miss the  way you make  me feel      and it's real
  We watched the  sunset over the castle on the hill
              Over the castle on the hill
              Over the castle on the hill
   One friend left to sell clothes, one works down by the coast
   One had two kids but lives alone, one's brother overdosed
   One's already on his second wife, one's just barely getting by but
   These people raised me and I-I-I, can't wait to go home
  And I'm on my   way, I still remember
  These old country  lanes when we did not know the answers
  And I miss the  way you make  me feel      and it's real
  We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
              Over the castle on the hill
              Over the castle on the hill

  I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant - but nothing

  like a bird without a song
  Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling

he said boy you better try to have fun

  all died when you went away

                 Hey!
                 Hey!
I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
The stairs creak as you sleep, it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
And some days I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary, this
  ship will carry our
bodies safe to shore
                 Hey!
                 Hey!
                 Hey!
There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young (and full of life and full of love)
Some days I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you my dear
'Cause though the truth may vary, this
  ship will carry our
bodies safe to shore   Hey!
Don't listen to a word I say. Hey!
The screams all sound the same. Hey!
Though the truth may vary, this
  ship will carry our
bodies safe to shore
                 Hey!
                 Hey!
You're gone, gone, gone away. I watched you disappear
All that's left is a ghost of you
Now we're torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do
Just let me go, we'll meet again soon
Now wait, wait, wait for me. Please hang around
I'll see you when I fall asleep. Hey!
Don't listen to a word I say. Hey!
The screams all sound the same. Hey!
Though the truth may vary, this
  ship will carry our
bodies safe to shore
Don't listen to a word I say. Hey!

I'll fuck you up if you're mean to bugs

I skipped class to sit with you
I really like your spotty sweater
If ladybugs are girls
How do you make kids together?
What's it like in a female world
I bet it's just so much better

And I think this year I'm gonna be mean

They don't say much but
They have always listened to me
The other boys at school
Think it's cool to hate your parents
But they're lying all the time
The bugs advised that I should let 'em
And if you wanna cry
Make sure that they never see it
Or even better yet
Block it out and never feel it

She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the Heavens ever did speak
She is the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
'We were born sick,' you heard them say it
        My church offers no absolutes
She tells me 'worship in the bedroom'
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
     Command me to be well
Aaaaaaaaaaamen. Amen. Amen
     Take me to church, I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life                [Chorus](2x)

My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
To drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course

What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human, only then I am clean.

Ikaw lamang ang nasa isip ko sinta
Sana’y di na tayo magkahiwalay

Ikaw lamang ang aking minamahal
Ikaw lamang ang tangi kong inaasam
Makapiling ka habang buhay
Ikaw lamang sinta
Wala na kong hihingin pa
Wala na..huhhhohhhh
Ayoko ng maulit pa
Ang nakaraang ayokong maalala
Bawat oras na wala ka
Parang mabigat na parusa
Huwag mong kakalimutan na kahit nag-iba
Hindi ako tumigil magmahal sayo sinta

1,On Va Saimer Encore,Vincent Vallières,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/1127904,"Quand on verra dans l'miroir nos face ridées pleines d'histoires
Quand on en aura moins devant qu'on en a maintenant
Quand on aura enfin du temps et qu'on vivra tranquillement
Quand la maison sera payée, qui restera plus rien qu'a s'aimer
On va s'aimer encore, au travers des doutes, des travers de la route et de plus en plus fort
On va s'aimer encore, au travers des bons coups, au travers des déboires
À la vie, à la mort  on va s'aimer encore
Quand nos enfants vont partir, qu'on les aura vu grandir
Quand ce s'ra leurs tour de choisir, leurs tour de bâtir
Quand nos têtes seront blanches, qu'on aura de l'expérience
Quand plus personnes va nous attendre, qui rest'ra plus qu'a s'éprendre
On va s'aimer encore, au travers des doutes, des travers de la route et de plus en plus fort
On va s'aimer encore, au travers des bons coups, au travers des déboires
À la vie, à la mort  on va s'aimer encore
Quand les temps auront changés, qu'on s'ra complètement démodés
Quand toutes les bombes auront sautées, que la paix s'ra la pour rester
Quand sans boussoles sans plan, au partira au gré du vent
Quand on lèvera les voiles devenues d'la poussières d'étoiles
 On va s'aimer encore, après nos bons coups, après nos déboires et de plus en plus fort
 On va s'aimer encore, au bout de nos doutes au bout de la route au delà de la mort
 On va s'aimer encore, au bout du doute, au bout de la route au delà de la mort

Rings made mirrors of the Earth

There is a living promise land
Even over fields of sand
Seasons fill my burden
Cover me
Bring it back
More than a memory

Your golden waves
Are walking down  upon this place

I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your strength 
You'll be my vacation away from this place
You know what I want
Holding that cup 
That's pouring over
   Makes me wanna spread my arms and fly

Are walking down  upon this place

Where will you hide?

Cutting boards and hanging hooks
Bloody knives, cooking books

Tenderize bone to dust
The sweetest grease, finest meat

Supple sounds of dinner bells

Gonna camp in my sleeping bag I'm not gonna move
Got some words on cardboard, got your picture in my hand
Saying, ""If you see this girl can you tell her where I am?""
Some try to hand me money, they don't understand
I'm not broke I'm just a broken hearted man
I know it makes no sense but what else can I do
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you
Cos if one day you wake up and find that you're missin me
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I could be
Thinkin maybe you'll come back here to the place that we'd meet
And you'll see me waiting for you on the corner of the street
So I'm not moving, I'm not moving
Policeman says, ""Son you can't stay here""
I said, ""There's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year""
Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows
If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go
People talk about the guy that's waiting on a girl
There are no holes in his shoes but a big hole in his world
Maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved
Maybe you wont mean to but you'll see me on the news
And you'll come running to the corner
'cause you'll know it's just for you

Laid my hand upon your spine 
And there upon your shoulder

Won't go slow, so as not to focus and I notice
He'll hitch a ride with any guide as long as they go fast from whence he came,
But he's no good at being uncomfortable so he can't stop staying

I've been getting a long for long before you came into the play.
I am the baby of the family, it happens so
Everybody cares and wears the sheep's clothes while they chaperone.
Curious, you're looking down your nose at me while you appease,
Courteous to try and help but let me set your mind at ease.

  Goodbye, goodbye.
Every memory of walkin' out the front door, I found the photo of the friend
that I was looking for, It's hard to say it, time to say it
  Goodbye, goodbye.
  Remember the old arcade? Blew every dollar that we ever made.
The cops hated us hangin' out, they say somebody went and burned it down.
We use to listen to the radio and sing along with every song we'd know.
We said someday we'd find out how it feels to sing to more than just the
steering wheel.
Kim's the first girl I kissed. I was so nervous that I nearly missed.
She's had a couple of kids since then. I haven't seen her since God knows
when... Oh oh oh... Oh God I!
Every memory of lookin' out the back door, I had the photo album spread
out on my bedroom floor, It's hard to say it, time to say it
  Goodbye, goodbye.
Every memory of walkin' out the front door, I found the photo of the friend
that I was looking for, It's hard to say it, time to say it
  Goodbye, goodbye.
  I miss that time, I miss their faces
You can't erase, you can't replace it.
I miss it now. I can't believe it.
So hard to stay, too hard to leave it.
If I could relive those days I know the one thing that would never change...
Every memory of lookin' out the back door, I had the photo album spread
out on my bedroom floor, It's hard to say it, time to say it
  Goodbye, goodbye.
Every memory of walkin' out the front door, I found the photo of the friend
that I was looking for, It's hard to say it, time to say it
  Goodbye, goodbye.
  Look at this photograph...every time I do it makes me laugh.
Every time I do it makes me.

But there is really nothing, nothing we can do.
Love must be forgotten. Life can always start up anew.

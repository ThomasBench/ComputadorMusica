I could be happy the rest of my life
With a cinnamon girl.
A dreamer of pictures I run in the night
You see us together, chasing the moonlight,
My cinnamon girl.
Ten silver saxes, a bass with a bow
The drummer relaxes and waits between shows
For his cinnamon girl.
A dreamer of pictures I run in the night
You see us together, chasing the moonlight,
My cinnamon girl.
Pa sent me money now,
I need another chance
You see your baby loves to dance
Yeah...yeah...yeah.

You say you lost your faith
But that's not where it's at
You had no faith to lose
And you know it
I know the reason
That you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd
You're in with
Do you take me for such a fool
To think I'd make contact
With the one who tries to hide
What he don't know to begin with
You see me on the street
You always act surprised
You say, ""How are you?"" ""Good luck""
But you don't mean it 
When you know as well as me
You'd rather see me paralyzed
Why don't you just come out once
And scream it
No, I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief
Perhaps I'd rob them
And now I know you're dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Don't you understand
It's not my problem
I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment
I could be you
Yes, I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
You'd know what a drag it is
To see you

There was someone killed beneath the town hall light
There were few at the scene and they all did agree
That the man who ran looked a lot like me
The judge said, ""Son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else then you won't have to die""
I spoke not a word although it meant my life
I had been in the arms of my best friend's wife
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave where the night winds wail
  Nobody knows, no, and   nobody sees
  Nobody knows but me
The scaffold was high and eternity neared
She stood in the crowd and shed not a tear
But sometimes at night when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil she cries over my bones
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave where the night winds wail

I have squandered my resistance
For a pocket full of mumbles, such are promises
All lies and jest, still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest  m m m m ..
When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of a railway station, running scared
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know
Lie la lie Lie la lie Lie la lie Lie la lie Lie la lie
Asking only workman's wages I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there
Lie lie lie lie la
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone
Going home where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading meeeeeeeeee to going home.
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
And he carries a reminder of every glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out in his anger and his shame
I am leaving, I am leaving
But the fighter still remains

Says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off

God knows when, but you're doing it again
You better duck down the alleyway, looking for a new friend
The man in the coonskin cap in the pig pen
Wants eleven dollar bills, but you only got ten

Talking that the heat put plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway, Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May, orders from the D.A.

Walk on your tip toes, don't try No Doz
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, watch the plain clothes
You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows
Ah, get sick, get well, hang around the Ink Well
Ring a bell, hard to tell if anything is going to sell
Try hard, get barred, get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail, join the army, if you fail
Look out kid, you're gonna get hit
But losers, cheaters, six-time users
Hanging 'round the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool's looking for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, and watch your parking meters
Ah get born, keep warm, short pants, romance, learn to dance
Get dressed, get blessed, try to be a success
Please her, please him, buy gifts, don't steal, don't lift
Twenty years of schooling and they put you on the day shift
Look out kid, they keep it all hid

Don't wear sandals, try to avoid the scandals
Don't wanna be a bum, you better chew gum
The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handle

49,I Fought The Law,The Bobby Fuller Four,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-bobby-fuller-four/i-fought-the-law-chords-1046793,"Breaking rocks in the  hot sun,
I fought the law and the  law won
I fought the law and the  law won 
I needed money cause I  had none,
I fought the law and the  law won  
I fought the law and the  law won 
I left my baby and I feel so sad I guess my race is run,
Well she's the best girl that I ever had 
I fought the law and the  law  won  
I fought the law and the  law won 
Robbing people with a  six gun
I fought the law and the  law won 
I fought the law and the  law won 
I miss my baby and the  good fun,
I fought the law and the  law won  
I fought the law and the  law won 
I left my baby and I feel so sad I guess my race is run,
Well she's the best girl that I ever had 
I fought the law and the  law won  
I fought the law and the  law won

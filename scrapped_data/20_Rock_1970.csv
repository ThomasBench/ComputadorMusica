0,Life In The Fast Lane (ver 2),Eagles,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/eagles/life-in-the-fast-lane-chords-1726172,"He was a hard-headed man, he was brutally handsome, 
and she was terminally pretty.
She held him up, and he held her for ransom in the heart
He had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude, they said he 
They had one thing in common, they were good in bed.
She'd say, faster, faster, the lights are turnin' red.
Life in the fast lane, surely make you lose your mind, mmmm..
Life in the fast lane.
Eager for action and hot for the game, the coming attraction, 
the drop of a name.
They knew all the right people, they took all the right pills.
There were lines on the mirror, lines on her face, she pretended 
not to notice, she was caught up in the race.
Out every evening, until it was light, he was too tired to make it, 
Life in the fast lane, surely make you lose your mind.
Life in the fast lane.
Life in the fast lane, everything, all the time.
Life in the fast lane..uh-huh.
Blowin' and burnin,' blinded by thirst, they didn't see the stop sign,
She said, listen, baby, you can hear the engine ring..we've been up 
He said, call the doctor. I think I'm gonna crash.
The doctor say he's comin', but you gotta pay him cash.
They went rushin' down that freeway, messed around and got lost.
They didn't care, they were just dyin' to get off.
Life in the fast lane, surely make you lose your mind.
Life in the fast lane.
Life in the fast lane, everything, all the time.
Life in the fast lane..
Life in the fast lane..
Life in the fast lane.........life in the fast lane.

And nothin' ever really seems to come from it.
And then she looks me in the eye, says, ""We gonna’ last forever?""

For love is blind and you're far too kind, don't ever let it show
I wish that I knew what I know now,  when I was younger
I wish that I knew what I know now,  when I was stronger
The can can's such a pretty show, they'll steal your heart away
But backstage, back on earth again, the dressing rooms are gray
They come on strong and it ain't too long, ‘fore they make you feel a man
But love is blind and you soon will find, you're just a boy again
When you want her lips, you get a cheek, makes you wonder where you are
If you want some more and she's fast asleep, leaves you twinkling with the stars
Poor young grandson, there's nothing I can say
You'll have to learn, a-just like me, and that's the hardest way

Doin' ninety days for non-support
Tried to find me an executive position

They wouldn't listen to the fact that I was genius

Now I got them steadily depressin', low down mind messin'
workin' at the car wash blues
Well, I should be sittin' 
In an air conditioned 
Office in a swivel chair
Talkin' some trash to the secretaries
Sayin', ""Here, now mam-ma, come on over here.""
Instead, I'm stuck here rubbin' these fenders with a rag
And walkin' home in soggy old shoes
With them steadily depressin', low down mind messin'
workin' at the car wash blues
You know a man of my ability he should be smokin' on a big cigar
But till I get myself straight I guess I'll just have to wait
In my rubber suit a-rubbin' these cars
Well, all I can do is a shake my head
You might not believe that it's true
For workin' at this end of Niagara Falls
Is a undiscovered Howard Hughes
So baby, don't expect to see me
With no double martini in any high-brow society news

7,Shelter From The Storm (ver 3),Bob Dylan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bob-dylan/shelter-from-the-storm-chords-1460075,"'Twas in another lifetime   One of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue   The road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness   A creature void of form
Come in she said I'll give ya   Shelter from the storm
And if I pass this way again   You can rest assured
I'll always do my best for her   On that I give my word
In a world of steel-eyed death and men  Who are fighting to be warm
Come in she said I'll give ya   Shelter from the storm
Not a word was spoke between us   There was little risk involved
Everything up to that point   Had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place    Where it's always safe and warm
Come in she said I'll give ya   Shelter from the storm
I was burned out from exhaustion  Buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes   And blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile    Ravaged in the corn
Come in she said I'll give ya   Shelter from the storm
Suddenly I turned around   And she was standing there
With silver bracelets on her wrists  And flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully  And took my crown of thorns
Come in she said I'll give ya   Shelter from the storm
Now there's a wall between us  somethin' there's been lost
I took too much for granted got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began on a long forgotten morn
Come in she said  I'll give you shelter from the storm
Well the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much it's doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker he blows a futile horn
Come in she said  I'll give you shelter from the storm
I've heard newborn babies wailin' like a mournin' dove
And old men with broken teeth stranded without love
Do I understand your question then is it hopeless and forlorn
Come in she said  I'll give you shelter from the storm
In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation and they gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn
Come in she said  I'll give you shelter from the storm
Well I'm livin' in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor's edge someday I'll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born
Come in she said  I'll give you shelter from the storm

In the year of '39 assembled here the volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the
Blue and sunny morn, sweetest sight ever seen.
And the night followed day, and the storytellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
Never looked back, never feared, never cried.
Don't you hear my call, though you're many years away,
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand for the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew.
For my life, still ahead, pity me.

  Could these sensations make me feel the pleasures of a normal man?
  These sensations barely interest me for another day,
  I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, take the shock away.
  It's getting faster, moving faster now, it's getting out of hand,
  On the tenth floor, down the back stairs, it's a no man's land,
  Lights are flashing, cars are crashing, getting frequent now,
  I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, let it out somehow.
  What means to you, what means to me, and we will meet again,
  I'm watching you, I'm watching her, I'll take no pity from your friends,
  Who is right, who can tell, and who gives a damn right now,
  Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know,
  Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know,
  Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know.
  I've got the spirit, but lose the feeling,

  Feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, fee-ling.

as if it happened only yesterday
Parking by the lake,
and there was not another car in sight
looking any better than you did
And all the kids at school,
they were wishing they were me that night
And now our bodies are oh so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
C'mon! Hold on tight!
C'mon! Hold on tight!
Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
I can see paradise by the dashboard light
Ain't no doubt about it,
we were doubly blessed
Cause we were barely seventeen,
and we were barely dressed
Ain't no doubt about it;
baby got to go and shout it
Ain't no doubt about it,
we were doubly blessed
Cause we were barely seventeen,
and we were barely dressed
you got it drowning out the radio
I've been waiting so long,
for you to come along and have some fun
no you're never gonna regret it
So open up your eyes, I got a big surprise,
it'll feel all right,
well, I wanna make your motor run
And now our bodies are oh so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife
C'mon! Hold on tight!
C'mon! Hold on tight!
Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night
I can see paradise by the dashboard light
Though it's cold and lonely in the deep dark night (in the deep dark night)
Paradise by the dashboard light
You got to do what you can,
and let Mother Nature do the rest
Ain't no doubt about it,
we were doubly blessed
Cause we were barely seventeen,
and we were barely. . .

We're gonna go all the way and tonight’s, the night

Do you need me?
Will you make me so happy for the rest of my life?
Will you take me away and will you make me your wife?

I couldn't take it any longer,
And when the feeling came upon me,
like a tidal wave
I started swearing to my God and on my mother's grave,
that I would love you to the end of time
I swore that I would love you to the end of time!
So now I'm praying for the end of time,
to hurry up and arrive
Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you,
I don't think that I can really survive
I'll never break my promise or forget my vow,
(but God only knows what I can do right now)
I'm praying for the end of time,
it's all that I can do
Praying for the end of time, so I can end my time with you!!!

16,Bat Out Of Hell (ver 4),Meat Loaf,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/meat-loaf/bat-out-of-hell-chords-1001151,"  The sirens are screaming and the fires are howling
Way down in the valley tonight
There's a man in the shadows with a gun in his eye
And a blade shining oh so bright
There's evil in the air and there's thunder in the sky
And a killer's on the bloodshot streets
Oh and down in the tunnel where the deadly are rising
Oh I swear I saw a young boy
Down in the gutter, he was starting to foam in the heat
Oh Baby, you're the only thing in this whole world 
That's pure and good and right
And wherever you are and wherever you go
There's always gonna be some light
But I gotta get out
I gotta break it out now
Before the final crack of dawn
So we gotta make the most of our one night together
When it's over you know
We'll both be so alone
Like a bat out of hell
I'll be gone when the morning comes
When the night is over
Like a bat out of hell I'll be gone gone gone
Like a bat out of hell 
I'll be gone when the morning comes
  But when the day is done
And the sun goes down
And moonlight's shin-ing  through
Then like a sinner before the gates of heaven
I'll come crawling on back to you
I'm gonna hit the highway like a battering ram
On a silver black phantom bike
When the metal is hot and the engine is hungry
And we're all about to see the light
Nothing ever grows in this rotting old hole and
Everything is stunted and lost
And nothing really rocks
And nothing really rolls 
And nothing's ever worth the cost
And I know that I'm damned if I never get out
And maybe I'm damned if I do
But with every other beat I got left in my heart
You know I'd rather be damned with you
If I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned
Dancing through the night with you
If I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned
Gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned
If I gotta be damned you know I wanna be damned
Dancing through the night
Dancing through the night
Dancing through the night with you
Then like a sinner before the gates of heaven 
I'll come crawling on back to you 
Then like a sinner before the gates of heaven 
I'll come crawling on back to you 
I can see myself tearing up the road 
Faster than any    other boy  has ever gone 
And my skin is raw but my soul is ripe 
No one's gonna stop me now 
I gotta make my escape 
But I can't stop thinking of you 
And I never see the sudden curve until it's way too late 
And I never see the sudden curve till it's way too late
Then I'm dying at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun 
Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike 
And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell 
And the last thing I see is my heart 
Still beating 
Breaking out of my body and flyin away 
Like a bat out of hell 
Then I'm dying at the bottom of a pit in the blazing sun 
Torn and twisted at the foot of a burning bike 
And I think somebody somewhere must be tolling a bell 
And the last thing I see is my heart 
Still beating, Still beating 
Breaking out of my body and flyin away 
Like a bat out of hell 
  Like a bat out of hell

  Like a bat out of hell

Why do we never get an answer when we're knocking at the door?
There's a thousand million questions about hate and death and war.
'Cause when we stop and look around us, there is nothing that we need
In a world of persecution that is burning in its greed.
Ah,
Ah,       ah,     ah.
Why do we never get an answer when we're knocking at the door?
Because the truth is hard to swallow, That's what the war of love is for!
It's not the way that you say it when you do those things to me,
It's more the way that you mean it when you tell me what will be.
And when you stop and think about it, you won't believe it's true,
That all the love you've been giving has all been meant for you.
I'm looking for someone to change my life,
I'm looking for a miracle in my life
And if you could see what it's done to me
To lose the love I knew you'd safely lead me through.
Between the silence of the mountains and the crashing of the sea,
There lies a land I once lived in and she's waiting there for me.
But in the gray of the morning, my mind becomes confused,
Between the dead and the sleeping and the road that I must choose.
I'm looking for someone to change my life,
I'm looking for a miracle in my life
And if you could see what it's done to me
To lose the love I knew you'd safely lead me to
the land that I once knew
To learn as we grow old the secrets of our soul.

Amaj7 = x02120 (pre-anchor the 1 behind A's to make it easy)
 I'm all lost in the supermarket.
 I can no longer shop happily.
 I came in here for the special offer,
 a guar-an-teed per-so-nal-i-ty.
 I wasn't born so much as I fell out.
 Nobody seemed to notice me.
 We had a hedge back home in the suburb,
 over which I never could see.
I heard the people who live on the ceiling
scream and fight most scarily.
Hearing that noise was my first ever feeling!
That's how it's been all around me.
I'm all tuned in, I see all the programs.
I save coupons from packets of tea.
I've got my giant hit discotheque album!
I empty a bottle, I feel a bit free.
The kids in halls and the pipes in the walls
make me noises for company.
Long distance callers make long distance calls!
And the silence makes me lonely.

 here.                It disap-

Sitting like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer
And I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friends out there rolling round the basement floor
oo oo oo   oo oo oo
  And someone saved my life tonight sugar bear ( sugar bea -ea

You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized
Sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly
And butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away bye bye
Oo oo oo oo oo oo  oo-oo-oo
  I never realized the passing hours
   Of evening showers
A slip noose hanging in my darkest dre-eams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn out-played by a dominating queen
It's four o'clock in the morning
Damn it listen to me good
I'm sleeping with myself tonight
Saved in time, thank God my music's still alive

Oo oo oo oo oo oo  oo-oo-oo

Clinging to your stocks and bonds
Paying your H.P. demands forever
   They're coming in the morning with a truck to take me home

On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, and fire in the sky
Smoke on the water
They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
A funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids outa the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, and fire in the sky
Smoke on the water
We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare                                        
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds
We made a place to sweat

29,A Million Miles Away,Rory Gallagher,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/rory-gallagher/a-million-miles-away-chords-1828250,"This hotel bar is full of people, 
The piano man is really laying it down,
Even the old bartender is as high as a steeple,
So why tonight should I wear a frown? 
The joint is jumpin' all around me, 
And my mood is really not at style,
Right now the blues want to surround me,
But I'll break out after a while.
Well I'm a million miles away,
I'm a million miles away, 
I'm sailing like a driftwood,
On a windy bay, 
I'm a million miles away,
I'm a million miles away,
But I'm sailing like a driftwood,
On a windy bay,
Why ask how I feel,
Well, how does it look to you? 
I fell hook, line, and sinker,
Lost my captain and my crew.
I'm standing on the landing, 
There's no one there but me, 
That's where you'll see me, 
Looking out on the deep blue sea.
There's a song on the lips of everybody,
There's a smile all around the room, 
There's conversation overflowing,  
So why must I sit here with the blues.
This hotel bar has lost its people, 
The piano man has caught the last bus home
The old bartender just collapsed in the corner,
Why I'm still here, I just don't know,
I'm a million miles away,
A million miles away, 
I'm sailing like a driftwood on a windy bay, 
I'm a million miles away,

And when the morning light comes streaming in
I'll get up and do it again  Amen
Say it again  Amen

We waited for love to bring
Were they only the fitful dreams
Of some greater awakening
I've been aware of the time going by
They say in the end it's the wink of an eye
And when the morning light comes streaming in

Say it again  Amen

And the struggle for the legal tender
Where the sirens sing and the church bells ring
And the junkman pounds his fender
Where the veterans dream of the fight,
Fast asleep at the traffic light
And the children solemnly wait for the ice cream vendor
Out into the cool of the evening, strolls the pretender
He knows that all his hopes an dreams
Begin and end there
Ah the lovers as they run through the night
Leaving nothing but to choose off and fight
And tear at the world with all their might
While the ships bearing their dreams
Sail out of sight
I'm gonna find myself a girl,
Who can show me what laughter means
Then we'll fill in the missing colors in each others
Paint by number dreams
And then we'll put our dark glasses on
And we'll make love until our strength is gone
And when the morning light comes streaming in
we'll get up and do it again  Amen
get it up again  Amen
I'm gonna be a happy idiot, and struggle for the legal tender
Where the ads take aim, and lay their claim
To the heart and the soul of the spender
And believe in whatever may lie
In those things that money can buy
Though true love could have been a contender
Are you there, say a prayer for the pretender
Who started out so young and strong only to surrender
Say a prayer for the pretender
Are you there for the pretender
Are you prepared for the pretender

Nein, damals hab ich kein Konzert von dir versäumt.
Und nachts konnte ich nicht schlafen,
oder wenn, dann hab ich von dir geträumt.
Du spieltest Cello, in jedem Saal in unserer Gegend.
Ich saß immer in der ersten Reihe, und ich fand dich so erregend.
Cello, du warst eine Göttin für mich. Und manchmal sahst du mich an,
und ich dachte ""Mannomann"", und dann war ich wieder völlig fertig.
Ja, ich war ständig da, und das hat dich dann überzeugt.
Wir wollten immer zusammenbleiben.
Und überhaupt, mit dir, das war so groß. 
Das kann man gar nicht beschreiben.
Und heute wohnst du irgendwo, und dein Cello steht im Keller.
Komm pack das Ding doch nochmal aus, und spiel so schön wie früher.

In sixty-five I was seventeen, and running up 101
I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on
Running on, running on empty
Running on, running blind 
Running on, running into the sun, but I'm running behind.
Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive
Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive
In sixty-nine I was twenty-one, and called the road my own
I don't know when that road turned onto the road I'm on.
Running on, running on empty
Running on, running blind 
Running on, running into the sun, but I'm running behind.

People need some reason to believe;
I don't know about anyone but me
If it takes all night, that'll be all right
If I can get you to smile before I leave
Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels
I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels
I look around for the friends I used to turn to, to pull me through
Looking into their eyes I see them running too
Running on, running on empty
Running on, running blind 
Running on, running into the sun, but I'm running behind.

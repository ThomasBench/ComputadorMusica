Yes I'm lonely, wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why
In the morning, wanna die
In the evening, wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why
My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
And you know what it's worth
I'm lonely, wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why
The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bone
I feel so suicidal
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones
Lonely, wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why
Black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock 'n' roll
Wanna die, yeah wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

Hide your wings in a ghost tower
Sails cackling at every plate we break
What was cracked by scattered needles
The little minute gong coughs and clears his throat
Hey ho, never be still
Grasshoppers green Herbarian band
And the tune they play is ""In Us Confide""
So trip to heave and ho, up down, to and fro

Close our eyes to the octopus ride!

Isn't it bad so quiet there, in the wood
Meant even less to me than I thought
With a honey plow of yellow prickly seeds
Clover honey pots and mystic shining feed
Well the madcap laughed at the man on the border
Hey, ho, huff the Talbot
Cheat he cried shouting kangaroo
So true in their tree they cried
Please leave us here
Close our eyes to the octopus ride!

Waiting for the day

your eyes are deeper than time

I need help to show me things to say
give me your love before mine fades

And I'm not what I appear to be.
Of all the love I have won or have lost,
There is one love I should never have crossed.
She was a girl in a million my friend, 
I should have known she would win in the end. 
        I'm a loser, and I lost someone who's near to me,
        I'm a loser, and I'm not what I appear to be. 
Although I laugh and I act like a clown,
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown, 
My tears are falling like rain from the sky, 
Is it for her or myself that I cry. 
        I'm a loser, and I lost someone who's near to me,
        I'm a loser, and I'm not what I appear to be. 
What I have done to deserve such a fate, 
I realize I have left it too late. 
And so it's true pride comes before a fall, 
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all.
        I'm a loser, and I lost someone who's near to me,
        I'm a loser, and I'm not what I appear to be.

Lived a man who sailed to sea.
And he told us of his life,
In the land of submarines.
So we sailed unto the sun,
Till we found the sea of green.
And we lived beneath the waves,
In our yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
And our friends are all aboard,
Many more of them live next door.
And the band begins to play.
We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
We all live in a yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine.
As we live a life of ease,
Everyone of us has all we need.
Sky of blue and sea of green,
In our yellow submarine.

We all live in a yellow submarine,

like that                              it
Doesn't really matter what chords I play, what
words I say or time of day it is      As its on-
ly a Northern Song
Doesn't really matter what clothes I wear, or
how I fare or if my hair is brown   When its on-
ly a Northern Song
When you're listening late at night
                         But they are
                         They just play it
like that

Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, I love you.

E, F, G, H, I, J, I love you.

When I look into your eyes your love is there for me
It's all too much for me to take the love that's shining all around you
Everywhere it's what you make for us to take it's all too much
Floating down the stream of time from love is there for me
It's all too much for me to take the love that's shining all around you
All the world is birthday cake so take a piece but not too much
Sial me on a silver sun where I know that I'm free
It's all too much for me to take the love that's shining all around you
The more I learn The less I know and what I do it's all too much

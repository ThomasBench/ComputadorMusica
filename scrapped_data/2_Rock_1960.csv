turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kinda seasick
but the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
as the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
the waiter brought a tray
And so it was,___ that later,____
as the miller told his tale
that her face, at first just ghostly,
turned a whiter shade of pale
She said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
Would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were o____pen
They might just as well been closed
And so it was,___ that later,____
as the miller told his tale
that her face, at first just ghostly,
turned a whiter shade of pale
And so it was,___ that later,____

And one day his woman ran off with another guy 
Rocky didn't like that, he said, ""I'm going to get that boy."" 
So one day he walked into town and booked himself a room in the local
Rocky Racoon checked into his room 
only to find Gideon's Bible 
Rocky had come equipped with a gun 
to shoot off the legs of his rival. 
His rival, it seems, had broken his dreams 
by stealing the girl of his fancy 
Her name was Magill, and she called herself 'Lil' 
But everyone knew her as Nancy. 
Now she and her man (who called himself Dan) 
Were in the next room at the hoedown 
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin, 
he said, ""Danny boy, this is a showdown."" 
But Daniel was hot. He drew first and shot 
and Rocky collapsed in the corner. 
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin 
and proceeded to lie on the table. 
He said, ""Rocky, you met your match."" 
But Rocky said, ""Doc, it's only a scratch. 
And I'll be better... I'll be better Doc as soon as I am able."" 
Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room 
only to find Gideon's bible. 
Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt 
to help with good Rocky's revival.

41,In The Ghetto (ver 7),Elvis Presley,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/elvis-presley/in-the-ghetto-chords-851323,"As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries
cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto
People, don't you understand
The child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way
Well, the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto
And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto
Then one night in desperation
A young man breaks away
He buys a gun, he steals a car
He tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries
As a crowd gathers round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto
And as her young man dies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries

Would you stand up and walk out on me.

And I'll try not to sing out of key.

Picture yourself in a boat on a river
with tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
a girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
and she's gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Ah.
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
that grow so incredibly high.
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
waiting to take you away.
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
and you're gone.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Ah.
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds,
Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Ah.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.
Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Ah.
It's getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school (No, I can't complain)
The teachers that taught me weren't cool  (No, I can't complain)
You're holding me down, turning me around
Filling me up with your rules
I've got to admit it's getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine 
I used to be an angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can 
I've got to admit it's getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine 
Getting so much better all the time
It's getting better all the time, better, better, better
It's getting better all the time, better, better, better
I used to be cruel to my woman   
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can 
I've got to admit it's getting better
A little better all the time (it can t get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine 
Getting so much better all the time
It's getting better all the time, better, better, better
It's getting better all the time, better, better, better
Getting so much better all the time
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in and
stops my mind from wandering  where it will-- go
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door and
kept my mind from wandering where it will -- go                  And it
really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right, where I belong
I'm right where I belong
See the people standing there who disagree and never win and
wonder why they don't get in my door 
I'm painting the room in a colorful way and 
when my mind from wandering, where it will go                    And it
really doesn't matter if I'm wrong I'm right, where I belong
I'm right where I belong
Silly people run around who worry me and never ask me
why they don't get past my door 
I'm taking the time for a number of things that weren't important 
yesterday and I still   go
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in and 
stops my mind from wandering, where it will go                  
Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins 
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching a handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free
She (we gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She is leaving home after living alone for so many years
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown,
Picks up the letter that's lying there.
Standing alone at the top of the stairs,
She breaks down and cries to her husband Daddy our baby's gone.
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?
She (we never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (never a thought for ourselves)
Home (we struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone for so many years
Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade
She (what did we do that was wrong?)
Is having - we didn't know it was wrong
Fun (fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied for so many years
She's leaving home, bye bye
For - the benefit of Mr.Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques Fair- what a scene!
Over man and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!
The celebrated Mr. K.
performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring- don't be late!
Messrs. K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten summersets he'll undertake on solid ground
We've been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill!
We were talking about the space between us all
When I get older losing my hair,
Many years from now,
Birthday greetings bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door,
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four?
oo oo oo oooo oo oooo oo
You'll be older too,
(ah ah ah ah ah)
I could stay with you.
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone.
Sunday mornings go for a ride.
Doing the garden, digging the weeds,
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four?
Every summer we can rent a cottage in the Isle of Wight,
If it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
(ah ah)
Vera, Chuck, and Dave
Send me a postcard, drop me a line,
Stating point of view.
Yours sincerely, Wasting Away.
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
When I'm sixty-four?
Lovely Rita meter maid  Lovely Rita meter maid
Lovely Rita meter maid nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter, when I caught a glimpse of Rita
filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap he looked much older, and the bag across her shoulder
made her look a little like a military man
Lovely Rita meter maid may I enquire discreetly
When are you free to take some tea with me?
Lovely Rita meter maid  Lovely Rita meter maid
Took her out and tried to win her, had a laugh, and over dinner
told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it, took her home, I nearly made it,
sitting on the sofa with a sister or two
Oh, lovely Rita, meter maid, where would I be without you?
Give us a wink and make me think of you
Lovely Rita meter maid  Lovely Rita meter maid
Good morning, good morning, good morning, good morning, good morning ah
Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but ""What a day, how's your boy been?""
Nothing to do, its up to you
I've got nothing to say but it s okay
Good Morning, good morning, good morning ah
Going to work, don't want to go feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam when you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything's closed, it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own you're in the street
After a while you start to smile, now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing had changed it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's okay
Good morning, good morning, good morning ah
People running round it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town is getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and meet the wife
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts you start to flirt, now you're in gear
Go to a show you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say, but it's okay
Good morning, good morning, good
Good morning, good morning, good  (7x)

I read the news today oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late (ha ha ha.)
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

Ooh, they're red white and blue
And when the band plays hail to the chief
Ooh, they point the cannons at you, y'all
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no senator's son y'all
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, no
Some folks are born, silver spoon in hand
Lord, don't they help themselves, y'all
But when the tax man comes to the door
Lord, the house looks like a rummage sale, yeah
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no millionaire's son, no
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no fortunate one, no
Some folks inherit star spangled eyes
Ooh, they send you down to war, Lord
And when you ask 'em ""How much should we give?""
They only answer ""More! More! More!"", yoh
It ain't me, it ain't me, I ain't no military son, son

I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.
Though I know that evenin's empire has returned into sand,
Vanished from my hand,
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping.
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship,
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip,
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
To be wanderin'.
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way,
I promise to go under it.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.
Though you might hear laughin', spinnin', swingin' madly across the sun,
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escapin' on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facin'.
And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind,
I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're seein'
That he's chasing.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.
Then take me disappearin' through the smoke rings of my mind,
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come followin' you.

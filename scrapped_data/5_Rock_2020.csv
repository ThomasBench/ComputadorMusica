0,My Exs Best Friend,Machine Gun Kelly,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/machine-gun-kelly/my-exs-best-friend-chords-3281843,"  You know my ex, so that makes it all feel complicated, yeah
(It all seems complicated)
I read those texts that you sent to yours, but I'll never say it, yeah
(I'll never say—)
You walked in my life at 2 AM
  'Cause my boy's new girl is your best friend
    Act like you don't see me, we'll play pretend
  Your eyes already told me what you never said
Now we're in the backseat of the black car, goin' home
When she asked me ""Is it wrong if I come up with you?""
We're both drunk on the elevator
When I kissed you for the first time in New York City, uh
  I swear to God, I never fall in love
  Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it
  I swear to God, I never fall in love
  I never fall in love, but I can't get enough of it
First off, I'm not sorry, I won't apologize to nobody
You play like I'm invisible, girl, don't act like you ain't saw me
Last year was a mess and how I acted was beyond me
But the past still revolves me, you text me, I ain't responding
But now shit's done changed, go our separate ways
But look at this damage you did to me
I still want nothing to do between you and me
Please don't say nothin' at all, sound so true to me
We don't got nothin' to say, hey!
  I swear to God, I never fall in love
  Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it
  I swear to God, I never fall in love
  I never fall in love, but I can't get enough of it
  I swear to God, I never fall in love
  Then you showed up and I can't get enough of it
  I swear to God, I never fall in love
  I never fall in love, but I can't get enough of it
  You know my ex, so that makes it all feel complicated, yeah

Just one will do
I'll say goodbye, to gossamer skies
The city will move out of frame
But it’s still you who remains
Give me a minute
Kiss me again
I'll say goodbye, to cloudy blue skies
I trade all I got in my name
For you instead of this pain
Maybe it's time to forget you
Maybe it's time to throw dirt upon your name
Or place blame
But it's no one's fault
No, it's no one's fault
We're just late
I'll give you a minute
Let you have peace
I'll say farewell, to what I can't tell
I bet that you'll do just the same
And maybe I'm what remains

Was not your momma's prayer
But I was your first and your
Last ticket out of there
I caught your wings on fire
When I smoked my bronco tires
Out of that town
I'm good at rollin' dice
No good at standin' still
You liked the thought of chasin'
Life instead of dollar bills
We were livin' wreckless
Nothin' to catch us, baby

This ain't for everybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge

It's a Hell of a view
I paint with my old Gibson
You paint your purple sky
This town's our canvas, baby
Let's paint it red tonight
Go out like shootin' stars
Chasin' what's in our hearts
Into thе blue (Into the blue)

That I don’t show enough
Of what I think
It’s only when I drink, I open up
But I promise that I love you
Even with that hair-do
I’m sorry I made fun of it
It’s not your fault it looks like shit
I have never tolerated someone for so long
I’ve never laughed so much
I haven’t written a sad song
There’s no one else I’d rather fall asleep with
And dream with
You’re my best friend in the world
When we’re ninety-eight and ninety-nine
Tumblin’ down the stairs
You’ll barely catch me in time
We’ll argue about what to watch on TV
Finally pick a movie, then we’ll fall asleep
We’ll still be a little bit strange
Some things never change
It’s funny ‘cause you drive me half-insane
A universe without you would be thoroughly mundane
There’s no one else I’d rather fall in love with
And that is
My best friend in the world
You’re my best friend in the world

I wasn't born a renegade
I felt alone, still feel afraid
I stumbled through it anyway
I wish someone would have told me that this life is ours to choose
No one's handing you the keys or a book with all the rules
The little that I know I'll tell to you
When they dress you up in lies and you're left naked with the truth
You threw your head back, and you spit in the wind
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in
Let 'em drag you through hell, they can't tell you to change who you are
And when the storm's out, you run in the rain
Put your sword down, dive right into the pain
Stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars
That's all I know so far
So you might give yourself away, yeah
And pay full price for each mistake
But when the candy-coating hides the razor blade
You can cut yourself loose and use that rage
I wish someone would have told me that this darkness comes and goes
People will pretend but baby girl, nobody knows
And even I can't teach you how to fly
But I can show you have to live like your life is on the line
You threw your head back, and you spit in the wind
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in
Let 'em drag you through hell, they can't tell you to change who you are
And when the storm's out, you run in the rain
Put your sword down, dive right into the pain
Stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars
That's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far
I will be with you 'til the world blows up, yes
Up and down and through 'til the world blows up, yeah
When it's right or it's all fucked up, 'til the world blows up, 'til the world blows up
And we will be enough and until the world blows up
Just throw your head back, and spit in the wind
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in
Let 'em drag you through hell, they can't tell you to change who you are

Put your sword down, dive right into the pain

Eat the gun as it feeds you

Once again, empty horses
Gallop through the violet door
Follow red, crooked courses
Shadows on the moonlit floor
Oh my stars, winged creatures
Gathering in silken height
Like the last human teachers
Once again, wе must bleed new
Even as the hours shakе
Crystal blood like a dream true
A ripple in the wound and wake

That you are the river of light

Flicker, fever, fill the form
With a warm gush, now I wanna touch
Like we never could before
I’d fly to you tomorrow,
I’m not fighting in this war
I wanna drop my arms and take your arms
And walk you to the shore
I remember building an energy shield
In your room, like a temple
Swallows in the windless field
Very thin, with your mother
Tall as a pale green tree
Very wild, bright as winter
Rising with a prism key
And a child to deliver
Taken with the blood and vine
The first little angel
  Little Andy,
Soft in your newborn skin
Only one, little Andy,
Will you return again?
I believe we can renew
And you could be my brother
Once again, fall asleep with
Our backs against each other
You believe, I believe too
That you are the river of light
Who I love
That I sing to
In the belly of the empty night

I'll be your morning bright goodnight shadow machine
I'll be your record player, baby, if you know what I mean
I'll be your real tough cookie with the whiskey breath
I'll be a killеr and a thriller and the cause of our dеath
In the blossom of the months
I was sure that I'd get driven off with thought
So I swallowed all of it
As I realized there was no one who could kiss away my shit

I'll be your record player, baby, if you know what I mean
I'll be your real tough cookie with the whiskey breath
I'll be a killеr and a thriller and the cause of our dеath
Paul, I know you said that you'd take me any way I came or went
But I'll push you from my brain
See, you're gentle, baby
I couldn't stay, I'd only bring you pain
I was your starry-eyed lover and the one that you saw
I was your hurricane rider and the woman you'd call
We were just two moonshiners on the cusp of a breath
And I've been burning for you baby since the minute I left

Try the medication that I bought instead
It's workin' for a little, but there's not much left
Darling, don't you weep
There's a place for me
Somewhere we can sleep
See you in your dreams

Drivin' past a graveyard on a lonesome street
All the little flowers gave me somethin' to believe in
Never knew the feelin' of a stable home
Been a couple years of livin' on the road
Couldn't really tell you where they'd leave a stone
To visit me when I am dead and gone

I'll make my own with you each night
I'll kidnap all the stars and I will keep them in your eyes

And hang 'em from a fishin' line

Takin' a bow, lookin' so proud
Look at me now, talkin' about pills in my mouth
Under the tongue, isn't it fun?

Scarlet angel, I am too small to see
Earn earn, shuffle round the big city
Burning the rubber down, crossing the hot concrete
I'm gonna leave town, there is someone to meet
She turns her head around a full three-sixty
Bedroom rising from an old growth tree
Bringing out the sawmill, cutting the twelve-inch beams
Building a pattern, the reservoir to fill with dreams
Rings like Saturn telling their old story
Windmills turn and turn eternally
What do you yearn for? Where do you long to be?
I've been here before, looking at the wild country
Open the screen door, talking with Diane Lee
Radio singing from the corner of the kitchen
I got the oven on, I got the onions wishing
They hadn't made me cry, filling the sink with dishes
Letting them air dry, waiting for the wind's permission
Too many movies got me shivering and shy
Turning the lights out, glistening in the owl's eye
Glimmer like lightning under the violet sky
Shimmer like diamonds, watching the red moon rise

I liked it better when you improvised the story we had
If you adore me, why do you ignore me?
I liked it better when you sent me ""sorry"" when I was sad
Stop saying, ""It's my bad""
You're acting like your deadbeat dad
I know, you know you're better than that
But you can't respond when you react
I'm tired of dumb boy talk
Of getting close, you say you won't, you do
Then act as though you don't
You're not a ghost, I'm not afraid of you
I started letting go
You let me know you were just confused
And I still think that you're cute
But I need you to remember that good girls don't get used
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah
Good girls don't get used
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah, ah-ah

Did you want a ribbon?
'Cause I'm gonna need to hear more than that
Gotta show me if you wanna know me
Maybe you would know by now
I'm the greatest thing you could have
Stop saying it's my bad
Forgetting everything we had
I know, you know you're better than that

Who's the girl in your story?
Hard to believe that you really care at all if
When you're bored or you're horny
I wanna hang out but you're busy hunting down a booty call
Like for a weekend, but then pretend nothing happened, is that so?
But supposedly a girl that's just your friend was in your home

I wish someone had told me I'd be doin' this by myself
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for
But it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door
Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more
Than anyone before (Anyone before)
 Too bad they're usually deranged
Last week, I realized I crave pity
When I re-tell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest
I was still bein' ignored (Lyin' for attention, just to get neglection)
Now we're estranged
 Things I once enjoyed
 Just keep me employed now
 Things I'm longing for
 Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeird
That we care so much, until we don't
I'm gettin' older, I've got more on my shoulders
But I'm gettin' better at admitting when I'm wrong
I'm happier than ever, at least, that's my endeavor
To keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure
'Cause to be honest, I just wished the word I promised
Would depend on what I'm givin' (Not on his permission)

 Just keep me employed now

About my music
   About my body
Some people hate what I wear
Some people use it to shame others

And nothing I do goes unseen
So while I feel your stares, your disapproval or your sigh of relief
Would you like me to be smaller, weaker, softer, taller?
Would you like me to be quiet?
Am I my stomach? My hips?
Is it not what you wanted?
If I wear what is comfortable, I am not a woman
If I shed the layers, I'm a slut
Though you've never seen my body, you still judge it
   We make assumptions about people based on their size
We decide who they are
If I wear more, if I wear less

Had a pretty boy over, but he couldn't stay
On his way out I made him sign an NDA, mm
 Yeah, I made him sign an NDA
Once is good enough
'Cause I don't want him having shit to say-ay, ayy, ayy, ayy-ayy
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no

I been havin' fun (Fun, fun, fun) gettin' older now
Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth

I'm not your friend or anything
Damn, you think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend or anything
Damn, you think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
What the hell are you talking about
Get my pretty name outta your mouth
We are not the same with or without
'bout me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal
I'm not your friend or anything
Damn, you think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend or anything
Damn, you think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I don't want press to put your name next to mine
Wanna be nice enough
  Articles, articles, articles
(Got a lotta) Interviews, interviews, interviews
I'm not your friend or anything
Damn, you think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend or anything
Damn, you think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name
I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name
I'm not your friend or anything

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true, mmm
Give me a day or two
To think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do,  mm-mm
  Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable, ooh
So if you really wanna know
When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (I'm happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mmm
You called me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut them all out for you 'cause I was a kid
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone
    Home alone, tryin' not to eat
  Distract myself with pornography
     I hate the way she looks at me
I can't stand the dialogue, she would never be
 That satisfied, it's a male fantasy
    I'm goin' back to therapy
'Cause I loved you then, and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm gett---ing  ov---er  you
Or just pre---tend---ing  to
Be   al----right, con---vince my--self I  hate you
     I got a call from a girl I used to know
  We were inseparablе years ago
     Thought we'd get along, but it wasn't so
     And it's all I think about whеn I'm behind the wheel
  I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel
     But nothing lasts, I know the deal
'Cause I loved you then, and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm gett---ing  ov---er  you
Or just pre---tend---ing  to
Be   al----right, con---vince my--self I  hate you
Can't get   ov--er  you
No mat--ter what  I   do
I know  I   should, but  I could nev-er hate you

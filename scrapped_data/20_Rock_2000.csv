The same way that I always do
This is the last smile
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
The sacrifice is never knowing
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see you're testing me pushes me away  x2
I've tried like you
To do everything you wanted too
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
The sacrifice is never knowing
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see you're testing me pushes me away  x2

And he doesn't like it   Being this way
And she tried so hard to steer away from the meeting place
But her heart had led her there
She clings to his consciousness  where--ver he lays
He struggles to sleep at night and du-ring the day
He's worried she's waiting in his dreams
To drag him back to the meeting place
His love   had left him there
Where her voice still echoes
""I'm sorry I met you darling, I'm sorry I met you""
As she turned into the night all he had was the words
""I'm sorry I met you darling, I'm sorry I left you""

Because it's cruel to e--veryone

That likened him to all the stories he told
Of past battles won and lost and legends of old
A seasoned veteran in his own time
On the battlefield he gained respect for fame
With many medals of bravery and stripes to his name
He grew a beard as soon as a he could to cover the scars on his face
And always urged his men on
But on the eve of great battle with the infantry in dream
The old general tossed in his sleep a lesson with its meaning
He awoke from the night to tell what he had seen
And walked slowly out his tent
All the men held tall with their chests in the air
With the courage in their blood and the fire in their stare
And it was a grey morning and they all wondered how they would fare
Till the old general told them to go home
I have seen the others and i have discovered
That this fight is not worth fighting
And i've seen their mothers and i will no other
To follow me where i'm going, so...
Take a shower and shine your shoes

So stay away from me,
The beast is ugly,
I feel the rage
and I just can't hold it.

In the closets, in the halls,

Hiding under the bed,
In my body, in my head.

Make it end?

It's just beneath the skin,

The nightmare's just begun,
I must confess that I feel like a monster.

Hid under lock and key,
I keep it caged but I can't control it.

he'll tear me up, break me down,
Why won't somebody come and save me from this,
Make it end?

Its teeth are razor sharp,
There's no escape for me,
It wants my soul, it wants my heart.
No one can hear me scream,
Maybe it's just a dream,
Maybe it's inside of me,
Stop this monster.

The nightmare's just begun,

While this town is busy sleeping,
All the noise has died away.
I walk the streets to stop my weeping,
'Cause she'll never change her ways.
Don't fool yourself,
She was heartache from the moment that you met her.
Ah, my heart feels so still
As I try to find the will to forget her, somehow.
   Ooh, I think I've forgotten her now.
Her love is a rose, pale and dying.
Dropping her petals in land unknown
All full of wine, the world before her,
Was sober with no place to go.
Don't fool yourself,
she was heartache from the moment that you met her.
My heart is frozen still
As I try to find the will to forget her, somehow.
   She's somewhere out there now.
Well my tears falling down as I try to forget,
Her love was a joke from the day that we met.
All of the words, all of her men,
All of my pain when I think back to when.
Remember her hair as it shone in the sun,
The smell of the bed when I knew what she'd done.
Tell yourself over and over you won't ever need her again.
Don't fool yourself,
she was heartache from the moment that you met her.
My heart is frozen still
As I try to find the will to forget her, somehow.
   She's somewhere out there now.
Oh,
She was heartache from the day that i first met her.
My heart is frozen still
As i try to find the will to forget you somehow
Cause i know you're somewhere out there right now.

That everyone I knew was waiting on a queue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth

It's coming down to nothing more than apathy

The smoke and who's still standing when it clears

I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
To say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along

You find another friend and you discard
As you lose the argument in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between

Never thought that you wanted to bring it down

And all the times we laughed with you
And all the times that you stayed true to us

I said, I thank you, I'll always thank you

And I love you, I'll always love you

And even when the times got hard
you were there to let us know that we'd get through
you showed me how to be a man
you taught me how to understand the things people do
You showed me how to love my God
You taught me that not everyone knows the truth

Ça pas été long qu'on l'a r'trouvé à quat' pattes dans' nature 
En train d's'ostiner avec sa vomissure...
A va être bonne à soir dans l'shack à Hector
Ouvre la valise pis sort les bouteilles de fort
Pis si jamais ton foie décide d'être malade
Bouche-toi donc l'nez 
Pis va donc faire une p'tite prom'nade
Au p'tit matin Talbot se r'mettait d'sa brosse
Ça f'sait une heure qu'y était enfermé dans 'bécosse
En sortant y nous a dit : ""Si vous allez à 'toilette...
J'vous conseille de craquer une alumette""
On s'est rendu compte qu'Roger s'était poussé
Avec not' char not' linge not' argent pis nos clés
Heureusement y'a pris soin de nous laisser 3-4 six-pack
Qu'on va boire à soir ben écrasé dans l'shack
A va être bonne à soir dans l'shack à Hector
Ouvre la valise pis sort les bouteilles de fort
Et la morale de cette charmante histoire
Qui boit trop fort s'en revient sans son char......

And a baseball cap holding down her black hair.

  He drove in from Mexicali no worse for wear.
  Money to burn, time to kill, but
  Five minutes looking in his eyes and 
  We all knew he was broken pretty bad, so we gave him what we had.
We cleared a space for him to sleep in,
And we let the silence that's our trademark
Make its presence felt.
Come on in, we haven't slept for weeks.
Drink some of this, it'll put color in your cheeks.
  They came in by the dozens, walking or crawling.
Some were bright-eyed,
Some were dead on their feet.
  And they came from Zimbabwe, Or from Soviet Georgia,
East Saint Louis, or from Paris, or they lived across the street.
But they came, and when they'd finally made it here,
It was the least that we could do to make our welcome clear.
Come on in, we haven't slept for weeks.
Drink some of this, this'll put color in your cheeks.

  Hindi ko alang alam kung pano basta biglang nagsama tayo
  di nagtagal ay napaibig mo ako
Mula umaga hanggang uwian natin laging magkasama tayong dalawa
parang kahapon lang nangyari sa akin ang lahat 
tila isang tulang medyo romantiko ang banat
ngunit ng napag-usapan bigla na lang nagkahiyaan
mula noon hindi na tayo nag-pansinan
At bakit ko ba pinabayaan 
mawala ng hindi inaasahan

nawala na      wala ng nagawa
Panay ang plano ngunit panay ang urong
at inabot na ng dulo ng taon
Graduation natin nung biglang nag-absent partner ko
tadhana nga naman naging mag-partner tayo
eksakto na ang timing
planado na ang sasabihin

 you know the summer's coming soon
though the interstate is choking under salt and dirty sand
and it seems the sun is hiding from the moon
 Your daddy told you when you were a girl
the kind of things that come to those who wait
so give it a rest girl, take a deep breath girl
and meet me at the Bay State   tonight
The snow is coming down on our New England town
and it's been falling all day long
what else is new?, what could I do?
I wrote a valley winter song to play for you
  And late December, can drag a man down
 you feel it deep in your gut
 short days and afternoons spent pottering around
in a dark house with the windows painted shut
 Remember New York staring outside
 as wreckless winter made its way
from Staten Island to the Upper West Side
whiting out our streets along the way
The snow is coming down on our New England town
and it's been falling all day long
what else is new?, what can I do?
but sing this valley winter song I wrote for you

Thanks for all you've done
i've missed you for so long,  i can't believe you're gone
you still live in me
i feel you in the wind, u guide me constantly
i never knew what it was to be alone.. no
cause you were always there for me, you were always waiting
but now i come home and i miss your face so
smiling down on me, i close my eyes to see
and i know, you're a part of me 
and its your song, that sets me free
i sing it while i feel i cant go on
i sing tonight, cause it comforts me
and i know, you're a part of me 
and its your song, that sets me free
i sing it while i feel i cant go on
i sing tonight, cause it comforts me
i'm glad he set you free from sorrow
but i'll still love you more tomorrow
and you'll be here with me still
all you did you did with feeling
and you always found a meaning
and you always will
and you always will
and you always will
and i know, you're a part of me 
and its your song, that sets me free
i sing it while i feel i cant go on
i sing tonight, cause it comforts me

  as we walked we were talking and I didn't say half the things I wanted to
  of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
  I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
  Hey Stephen, boy you might have me believing I don't always have to be
alone
  cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
  can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
  come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
can't help it if there's no one else
  I can't help myself
  Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
so I've got some things to say to you
  I seen it all, so I thought, but I never seen nobody shine the way you do
  The way you walk, the way you talk, the way you say my name
  It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
  Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving
I think you and I should stay the same
  cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
  can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
  come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
can't help it if there's no one else
  I can't help myself
  They're dimming the street lights
you're perfect for me, why aren't you here tonight?
  I'm waiting alone now so come on and come out and pull me near
shine, shine, shine
  Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons why I should be the one you choose
  Well, all those other girls,
  well, they're beautiful but would they write a song for you
  I can't help it if you look like an angel
  can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
  come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
can't help it if there's no one else
  I can't help myself.. if you look like an angel
  can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
  come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
can't help it if there's no one else
  I can't help myself.....myself
  can't help myself   I can't help myself

Take whatevers left and take it with you out the door
See if I cry, see if I shed a single sorry tear
I can't say that its been great, no in fact its been a wasted worried year
And everybody sees, and everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong, and its been that way too long
Take it as it comes, and be thankful when its done
Theres so many ways to act
And theres many shades of black
Theres so many shades of black
Theres so many shades of black
Let it out, let it all out, say whats on your mind
You can kick and scream and shout and say things that are so unkind, Yea
See if I care, see if I stand firm or if I fall
Cause in the back of mind, and on the tip of my tongue
Is the answer to it all
And everybody sees, and everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong, and its been that way too long
Take it as it comes, and be thankful when its done
Theres so many ways to act
And theres many shades of black
Theres so many shades of black
Theres so many shades of black
And everybody sees, and everyone agrees
That you and I are wrong, and its been that way too long
Take it as it comes, and be thankful when its done
Theres so many ways to act
And you cannot take it back
No you cannot take it back

49,Waiting In The Weeds (ver 2),Eagles,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/eagles/waiting-in-the-weeds-chords-602473,"It's comin' on the end of August
Another summer's promise almost gone
And though I heard some wise man say
That every dog will have his day
He never mentioned that these dog days get so long
I don't know when I realized the dream was over
Well, there was no particular hour, no given day
You know, it didn't go down in flame
There was no final scene, no frozen frame
I just watched it slowly fade away
And I've been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for my time to come around again and
Hope is floating on the breeze
Carrying my soul high up above the ground and
I've been keepin' to myself  Knowin'
that the seasons are slowly changing
Even though you're with somebody else
He'll never love you like I do
I've been biding time with the crows and sparrows
While peacocks prance and strut upon the stage
If finding love is just a dance  Proximity and chance
You will excuse me if I skip the masquerade
And I've been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for the dust to settle down along the
Back roads running through the fields
Lying on the outskirts of this lonesome town
And I imagine sunlight in your hair
You're at the county fair
You're holding hands and laughing
And now the ferris wheel has stopped
You're swinging on the top
Suspended there with him
And he's the darling of the sheik
The flavor of the week is melting
Down your pretty summer dress
Baby, what a mess you're making
I've been stumbling through some dark places
Now I'm following the plow
I know I've fallen out of your good graces
It's alright now
And I've been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for the summer rain to fall upon the
Wild birds scattering the seeds
Answering the calling of the tide's eternal tune
The phases of the moon
The chambers of the heart
The ebb and dart of small gray
Spiders spinning in the dark
In spite of all the times the web is torn apart
And I've been waiting in the weeds
Waiting for the time to come around again and
Hope is floating on the breeze
Carrying my soul high up above the ground and
I've been keeping to myself
Knowing that the seasons are slowly changing
Even though you're with somebody else
He'll never love you like I do

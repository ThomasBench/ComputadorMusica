0,For Herself (ver 2),Reba McEntire,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/reba-mcentire/for-herself-chords-2334083,"Uncle Slim had let her know she couldn't ride that horse.
He was the one that was only meant for men.
She waited around till way after dark,
Rode that horse with all her heart.
And in the night how she rode.
Somehow she always knew she had the strength inside.
And even if she fell, she'd survive.
In spite of all the tears she may cry,
This is how she has to live her life.
As hard as it may be she has to find out for herself.
Mama and daddy told her from the start he was no good.
They'd seen how he treated the other girls.
She waited around till the sun went down,
Slipped out the house not makin' a sound.
And in the night oh how they drove.
It was fifteen years to the day he became a stranger in her eyes
In the coldest words of anger
He said without me you won't survive.
There's a suitcase in the closet she had packed six months ago.
She don't leave a note that's not her style.
So she waited around till way after dark,
Left that man who broke her heart.
Now she's gone, oh she's gone.
Somehow she always knew she had the strength inside.
And even if she fell, she'd survive.
In spite of all the tears she may cry,
This is how she has to live her life.
As hard as it may be she has to find out for herself.

1,Will He Ever Go Away,Reba McEntire,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/reba-mcentire/will-he-ever-go-away-chords-1814866,"On a cool grey morning, I watched with my own eyes
As he headed out the driveway and finally out of my life
Oh, I knew he'd soon be miles from my mind
So why should tears start falling after all this time
How can a memory last this long
Will he ever go away
Even the stars burn out and fall
Will he ever go away
How can someone who left so long ago
Still be here with me today
Will he ever go away
Shouldn't I start living my life for myself
Shouldn't it be easy to fall in love with someone else
Oh, why should it be his touch I feel in the dark
And will his voice always echo through my heart
How can a memory last this long
Will he ever go away
Even the stars burn out and fall
Will he ever go away
How can someone who left so long ago
Still be here with me today
Will he ever go away
Ohh, will he ever go away

And I'd spend it with you, darling, in a very special way.
I'd treat you to a sundae on a Saturday afternoon
And we'd spend the night together throwing snowballs at the moon.
We'd be aiming high and we'd be aiming low,
Winding up together, lord, and lettin' them snowballs go
And after every throw we'd share a little kiss
Make sweet love together every time we'd miss
Oh I'd like to meet the artist who painted up the sky
And I'd ask him what that color was he brushed against your eyes
And could he paint a picture of two lovers in one balloon
Who go flying off together to throw snowballs at the moon
We'd be aiming high and we'd be aiming low,
Winding up together, lord, and lettin' them snowballs go
And after every throw we'd share a little kiss
Make sweet love together every time we'd miss
If we could stop the world from spinnin, take it nice and slow I bet that we could hit once just before we go.

I ran across it just this afternoon
And I realised that I don't ever use it anymore
In fact last time I did, I think it was with you
When we were down in Cozumel
We had the whole beach to ourselves
And it's crazy now to think, that it's all there on that film
And I could take it to the store, to be developed but what for
I can still see everything just fine
Who needs pictures with a memory like mine
Standing there I couldn't help but think about
Everything that might be on that roll
I think it even has another trip we took
I guess that must have been at least 3 years ago
When we were down in Baton Rouge
And there wasn't much to do
So we drove into New Orleans every afternoon
And I swear that you would think, it was only yesterday
Cause I can still see everything just fine
Yeah who needs pictures with a memory like mine
Somewhere in my closet
There's a cardboard box just sitting on a shelf
It's full of faded memories
And it's been there ever since the night you left
Oh just forgotten photographs to remind me of the past
Oh but I can still see everything just fine

Who needs pictures with a memory like mine

chase that ghost out from under my bed, still these voices in my head,
keep talking weaving their spell, keep talking to myself, keep
talking from daylight till dawn and your out of my bones,
sweet amnesia, come and set me free, I don't care just got to
get you out of me!
bury your picture in my backyard, carry your picture in my shoe,
and keep walkin, till the hurtin stops, keep walkin till my temperature
drops, keep walkin till the fever is gone and your out of my bones.
                  your out of my bones.

And everybody's playin' - boys and girls
Women, children, me, and you
The dice are loaded and everything's fixed
Even a hobo would tell you this
Welcome to hard times and feelin' low
Do you like sinnin'? No?
Well, you will before you go
We've got lots of gamblin'
Oh, and we're tellin' lies
You're certainly welcome to hard times
Take a look in my eyes
Tell me what you see
Besides the bright blinking lights
Stretched out in front of me
I wonder if you'll notice
Would you even care
If I told you my life just isn't fair?
Welcome to hard times and feelin' low
Do you like sinnin'? No?
Well, you will before you go
We've got lots of gamblin'
Oh, and we're tellin' lies
You're certainly welcome to hard times
Yes, hope you're feelin' welcome to hard times

I couldn’t wait to twirl my pistols
And listen to the coyotes cry
We were set to stake our claim on forever
Underneath the western sky

Through the hills of Oklahoma
Hell  I never even learned to rope and ride
And I always thought that one day
We would ride off in the sunset
To somewhere far away
Or  baby  anyplace that’s wild
I never got to rope and wrangle
We never shot down the saloon
I never got to hear my spurs jingle-jangle
I never got to shoot the moon
But I never rode my pony
‘Cross the dusty plains of Texas
I never wore a six gun at my side

Doctor said, ""McKinley, death is on the wall
‪Say it to me, if you got something to confess
I heard all about it, he was going down slow ‬
‪I heard it on, the wireless radio ‬
‪From down in the boondocks way down in Key West ‬
‪I’m searching for love, for inspiration ‬
  ‪On that pirate radio station
‪Coming out of Luxembourg and Budapest ‬
‪Radio signal’s clear as can be
‪I’m so deep in love that I can hardly see ‬
‪Down on the flat lands, way down in Key West
‪Key West is the place to be ‬
‪If you’re looking for immortality ‬
‪Stay on the road, follow the highway sign ‬
‪Key West is fine and fair, ‬
‪If you lost your mind, you will find it there
‪Key West is on the horizon line
‪I was born on the wrong side of the railroad track
‪Like Ginsberg, Corso and Kerouac
‪Like Louis, and Jimmy and Buddy and all the rest ‬
‪Well, it might not be the thing to do ‬
‪But I’m sticking with you through and through ‬
‪Down in the flat lands, way down in Key West
‪I got both of my feet planted square on the ground ‬
‪Got my right hand high, with the thumb down ‬
‪Such is life, such is happiness
‪Hibiscus flowers, they grow everywhere here
‪If you wear one, put it behind your ear
‪Down in the bottom, way down in Key West ‬
‪Key West is the place to go
‪Down by the Gulf of Mexico ‬
‪Beyond the city, beyond the sifting sands
‪Key West is the gateway key ‬
‪to innocence and purity ‬
‪Key West, Key West is the enchanted land
‪I’ve never lived in the land of Oz ‬
‪Or wasted my time with an unworthy cause ‬
‪It’s hot down here, and you can’t be overdressed
‪China blossoms of a toxic plant ‬
‪They can make you dizzy, I'd like to help you but I can't
‪Down in the flat lands way down in Key West ‬
‪Well the fish tail ponds, and the orchid trees
‪They can give you that bleeding heart disease
‪People tell me I ought to try a little tenderness ‬
‪On Newton Street, Bay view Park ‬
‪Walking in the shadow after dark ‬
‪Down under, way down in Key West ‬
  ‪I played Gumbo Limbo spirituals
  ‪I know all the Hindu rituals ‬
‪People tell me that I’m truly blessed ‬
Bougainvillea blooming in the summer, in the spring
Winter here is an unknown thing
Down in the flat lands, way down in Key West
Key West is under the sun, under the radar, under the gun
You stay to the left, and then you lean to the right
  Feel the sunlight on your skin, the healing virtues of the wind
  Key West, Key West is the land of light
  Wherever I travel, wherever I roam
I’m not that far, before I come back home
I do what I think is right, what I think is best
History street off off Mallory Square
  Truman had his White House there
East bound, west bound, way down in Key West
  Twelve years old, they put me in a suit
  Forced me to marry a prostitute
There were gold fringes on her wedding dress
That’s my story, but not where it ends
She’s still cute, and we’re still friends
Down on the bottom, way down in Key West
  I play both sides against the middle
Tryin’ to pick up that pirate radio signal
I heard the news, I heard your last request
  Fly around my pretty little Miss
I don’t love nobody, give me a kiss
Down on the bottom, way down in Key West
  Key West is the place to be
If you’re looking for immortality
Key West is paradise divine
  Key West is fine and fair
If you lost your mind, you’ll find it there
Key West is on the horizon line

‪For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory ‬
‪Go tell it on the mountain, go tell the real story ‬
‪Tell in that straightforward Puritanical tone
‪In the mystic hours, when a person’s alone ‬
‪Goodbye Jimmy Reed, Godspeed‬
‪Thump on the bible, proclaim a creed‬
‪You won’t amount to much, the people all said
‪Cuz I didn’t play guitar behind my head‬
‪Never pandered, never acted proud‬
‪Never took off my shoes throw them in the crowds
‪Goodbye Jimmy Reed, goodbye and good night‬
‪Put a jewel in your crown and I’ll put out the light ‬
‪They threw everything at me, everything in the book
I had nothing to fight with but a butcher’s hook
They had no pity, they never lent a hand
I can’t sing a song I don’t understand
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, goodbye and good luck
I can’t play the record cuz my needle got stuck
‪Transparent woman in a transparent dress
‪Suits you well I must confess
‪I break open your grapes, I suck out the juice
I need you like my head needs a noose
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, goodbye and so long
I thought I could resist her but I was so wrong
‪God be with you, brother dear‬
If you don’t mind me asking, what brings you here?‬
Ah nothing much, I’m just looking for the man
Came to see where he’s lying in this lost land
Goodbye Jimmy Reed, and everything within ya‬

‪Of the most dangerous month of the year‬‬‬
At the worst time, at the worst place
That’s all I seem to hear‬‬‬
 I got up early so I could greet the goddess of the dawn
 I painted my wagon, ‬‬abandoned all hope‬‬‬
And I crossed the Rubicon ‬‬‬
‪Well, the Rubicon is a red river‬‬
Going gently as she flows
Redder than your ruby lips‬‬‬
And the blood that flows from the rose
Three miles north of purgatory
One step from the great beyond
‪I prayed to the cross, I kissed the girls
‪And I crossed the Rubicon‬
‪One of these dark days I’ll see‬‬‬
In this world so badly bent
How can I redeem the time‬‬?‬
The time so idly spent?‬‬
How much longer can it last? How long can it go on?‬‬
I embraced my love, put down my head‬
And I crossed the Rubicon ‬‬‬
I can feel the bones beneath my skin ‬‬‬
And they’re trembling with rage ‬‬‬
That the sun shines down upon ‬‬‬
And I crossed the Rubicon ‬‬‬
I put my heart up on the hill‬‬‬
Where some happiness I’ll find‬‬‬
Take the high road, take the low‬‬‬
Take any one you’re on
I poured the cup, I passed it along ‬‬‬
And I crossed the Rubicon ‬‬‬
Well you defiled the most lovely flower‬‬‬
I’ll cut you up with a crooked knife ‬‬‬
Lord, and I’ll miss you when you’re gone ‬‬‬
And I crossed the Rubicon ‬‬‬
You won’t find any happiness here‬‬‬
Find you some nice pretty boy‬
And who can I count upon‬
And I crossed the Rubicon‬
I feel the Holy Spirit inside‬‬‬
See the light that freedom gives‬‬‬
It’s darkest ‘fore the dawn (O Lord)‬‬
I turned the key then broke it off‬
And I crossed the Rubicon‬
Mona, baby, are you still in my mind?
And the autumn leaves are gone‬
And I crossed the Rubicon‬‬

 Lost in the stars
 Listening to the sounds of
The sad guitars
 Been thinking it all over and I've thought it all through
 I've made up my mind
 To give myself to you
 I saw the first
 Fall of snow
 I saw the flowers come and go
 I don't think that anyone ever else ever knew
 I've made up my mind
 To give myself to you
 I'm giving myself to you, I am
 From Salt Lake City to Birmingham
 From East L.A. to San Antone
I don't think I can bear to live my life alone
 My eye is like
 A shooting star
 It looks at nothin'
 Here or there
 Looks at nothin' near or far
 No one ever told me, it's just something I knew
 I've made up my mind
 To give myself to you
 If I had the wings
Of a snow white dove
 I'd preach the gospel
The gospel of love
 A love so real, a love so true
 I've made up my mind
 To give myself to you
 Take me out traveling, you're a traveling man
 Show me something I don't understand
 I'm not what I was, things aren't what they were
I'll go far away from home with her
 I traveled a long road
 Of despair
 I met no other
 Traveler there
 Lot of people gone, lot of people I knew
 I've made up my mind
 To give myself to you
Well, my heart's like a river, a river that sings
 Just takes me a while to realize things
 I've seen the sunrise, I've seen the dawn
 I'll lay down beside you when everyone's gone
 I've traveled from the mountains to the sea
 I hope that the gods go easy with me
 I knew you'd say yes, I'm saying it too
 I've made up my mind
 To give myself to you

  All through the summers   into January
I've been visiting morgues and    monasteries
Looking for the necessary body parts
 Limbs and livers and brains and hearts
I'll bring someone to life, is what I wanna do
I wanna create my own version of you
Well, it must be the winter of my  discontent
I wish you'd've taken me with you wherever you went
They talk all night and they talk all day
Not for a minute do I believe anything they say
I'm gon' bring someone to life, someone I've never seen
You know what I mean, you know exactly what I mean
I'll take the Scarface Pacino and The Godfather Brando
Mix it up in a tank and get a robot commando
If I do it upright and put the head on straight
I'll be saved by the creature that I create
I'll get blood from a cactus, gunpowder from ice
I don't gamble with cards   and I don't shoot no dice
Can you look at my face     with your sightless eyes?
 Can you cross your heart and hope to die?
  I'll bring someone to life, someone for real
Someone who feels the way that I feel
I study Sanskrit and Arabic to improve my mind
I wanna do things for the benefit of all mankind
I say to the willow tree,  ""Don't weep for me""
I'm saying to hell to all things that I used to be
Well, I get into trouble     then I hit the wall
No place to turn, no place at all
I'll pick a number between   a-one and two
And I ask myself, ""What would Julius Caesar do?""
I will bring someone to life in more ways than one
Don't matter how long it takes,
it'll be done when it's done
I'm gonna make you play the piano    like  Leon  Russell
Like Liberace, like St. John the Apostle
I'll play every number that  I  can play
I'll see you maybe on Judgment Day
 After midnight, if you still wanna meet
I'll be at the Black Horse Tavern on Armageddon Street
Two doors down,   not that far a walk
 I'll hear your footsteps, you won't have to knock
  I'll bring someone to life, balance the scales
I'm not gonna get involved any insignificant details
You can bring it to St. Peter   You can bring it to Jerome
You can bring it all the way over   bring it all the way home
Bring it to the corner where the children play
You can bring it to me on a silver tray
I'll bring someone to life, spare no expense
Do it with decency and common sense
Can you tell me what it means   to be or not to be?
 You won't get away with fooling me
Can you help me walk      that moonlight mile?
Can you give me the blessings of your smile?
I'll bring someone to life, use all of my powers
Do it in the dark, in the wee, small hours
 I can see the history of the whole human race
It's all right there      it's carved into your face
Should I break it all down?     Should I fall on my knees?
Is there light at the end of the tunnel, can you tell me, please?
Stand over there  by  the cypress tree
Where the Trojan women and children were sold into slavery
Long before the first   Crusade
Way back before England or America were made
Step right in  to the burning hell
Where some of the best-known enemies of mankind dwell
Mr. Freud with his dreams, Mr. Marx with his axe
See the raw hide lash rip the skin from their backs
 Got the right spirit, you can feel it, you can hear it
You've got what they call the immortal spirit
You can feel it all night      you can feel it in the morn'
It creeps in your body the day you were born
One strike of lightning is all that I need
And a blast of electricity that runs at top speed
Shimmy your ribs     I'll stick in the knife
Gonna jumpstart my  creation to life
I wanna bring someone to life, turn back the years
Do it with laughter and do it with tears

 Been up all night, have to stay on your guard
 The path that you're walking, too narrow to walk
 Every step of the way, another stumbling block
 The road that you're on, same road that you know
 Just not the same as it was ... a minute ago
Black rider, black rider, you've seen it all
You've seen the great world and you've seen the small
 You fell into the fire and you're eating the flame
 Better seal up your lips if you wanna stay in the game
 Be reasonable, mister, be honest, be fair
 Let all of your earthly thoughts be a prayer
Black rider, black rider, all dressed in black
 I'm walking away, you try to make me look back
 My heart is at rest, I'd like to keep it that way
 I don't wanna fight, at least not today
 Go home to your wife, stop visiting mine
 One of these days I'll forget to be kind
Black rider, black rider, tell me when, tell me how
 If there ever was a time, then let it be now
 Let me go through, open the door
 My soul is distressed, my mind is at war
 Don't hug me, don't flatter me, don't turn on the charm
 I'll take a sword and hack off your arm
Black rider, black rider, hold it right there
 The size of your cock will get you nowhere
 I'll suffer in silence, I'll not make a sound
 Maybe I'll take the high moral ground
 Some enchanted evening I'll sing you a song

How straight or curly her hair

It still knocks me off my feet

Forge my identity from the in- side  out

Take me to the river, release your charms
Let me lay down a while in your sweet, loving arms
Wake me, shake me, free me from sin

In a place like this
Cold coffee on the back porch
Wooden chair rocking back and forth
Now she wonders how it all went down

Found a job and filled in the rest
Never got around to leaving the nest
Holding on to not let go
But that path just wasn’t for her
She got out faster than the fireworks
Never took time to slow it down
Now she’s back in her hometown
Looking out at the cedars and the oaks
The mourning dove sings beneath the sky of blue
All the thoughts that led her out
On that road, without a doubt
Somewhere they fizzled out
Now she’s back in her hometown
What makes a life complete?
Roads traveled and the people you meet?
Or is just the silence
Of the times in between?
Her mind is racing as she sits alone
In the place that she used to call home
Memories are all around

Looking out at the light above the hills
Her mama sings beneath the sky of blue

Flowers might just get me through the door
I've always been the kind of man
Who learned from his experience
And this time, I just took him at his word
Thought about my wife at home
Just sittin' sad and all alone
And I know that ain't what my sweet gal deserves
So I called her up near closin' time
To tell her just what's on my mind
And I'd be comin' home after two
But judgin' by her pitchy tone
And her screamin' on the telephone
I might need those flowers more than you
In the pretty colored paper
Like I never had to do before

Eyes wide open to the picture show outside

Remember looking up at them in the front row
Hands touched together, almost outta sight

Of a Sunday afternoon
And we were only young but they were trying hard to reach us
How was I to know that there was something so worth keeping?
'Cause we were
Watching the world through an open window
Trees lined up like dominoes
This old car could find its own way home

To fight, to love, to laugh again

Singing songs along that ribbon of a road
And everyone you love is sitting there, so close

No, you'll never get old

Your momma gets pretty tired these days
After a few miles I guess they recognized some places
And I listened as they reminisced
About a world that they had always known
Probably never gonna be the same again
I caught 'em in the mirror, they were holding hands and smiling
Looking younger than they'd been in years
And they were
Watching the world through an open window
Trees lined up like dominoes
This old car could find its own way home

Don't matter what you wear
'Cause we're making it up as we go just dancing in the dark
So, come as you are (Come as you are)
Yeah, come as you are (Come as you are)
Oh, come as you are (Come as you are)
Yeah, come as you are, are, are (Come as you are)
Oh (Come as you are, come as you are)
Yeah, eh, eh (Come as you are, come as you are)
Come as you are

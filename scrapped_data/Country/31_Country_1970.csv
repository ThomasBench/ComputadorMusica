  And all the things You've done
I wondered all these years how You kept going
  And had the strength to carry on
She said You'd always be beside me
To help me up if I should fall
If I got lost You'd always find me
And all I have to do is call
When Moses cried for help to free his people
You opened up the mighty sea
David said   he sure looks big Lord
You said here's a stone and you got me
And when Daniel said the lions are gonna get me Lord
You said get down (get down) get down on your knees
And in six short days you made the world we lived in
And still You find the time for me
You stayed up forty days and forty nights
Makin' all that rain
And to see us messin' up this world
You love so much that's got to bring pain
If I was big enough and strong enough
To help You Lord I would   but I can't
  You gotta be tired Lord You gotta be tired
You gotta be tired

We can see the load on your tired, old shoulders
Mama, you're a trooper
Mama, you're a soldier
Mama, you mean a lot to me
She always got me out of bed 
Early Sunday morn
And took me off to church
Where I could learn about the Lord 
Mama tried to tell me how my life was gong to be
But I was young and wild and it was hard for me to see
Dear Mama,  now that we're older 
We can see the load on your tired, old shoulders
Mama, you're a trooper
Mama, you're a soldier
Mama, you mean a lot to me
Mama, you always taught me right from wrong when I was growing up 
And it's a pity that most people like me have to try everything for themselves. 
I realize now you always knew just what you were talking about 
And mama for all that hard work you did 
And for the sacrifices you made for us. 
I just want to say thanks a lot.

Humbled by the favours he must seek
From those that he encounters on his walk through misery
Who are rich enough to hurt just as they please
If not for love I could be one of these
An old man on a park bench stares with envy
At a couple with their children on their knees
While across the park a young man is caught by the police
Stealing for a habit he must feed
And if not for love I could be one of these
I could be one of these or so many many more
Always at the beck and call of shame
I'm thankful I was called by love to walk among the happy
But if not for you love wouldn't know my name
A man of squander talents vainly calls on
His gift of God now straining through his soul
While in the crowd before him a jealous friend awaits
The moments that he can no longer please
And if not for love I could be one of these
I could be one of these or so many many more
Always at the beck and call of shame
I'm thankful I was called by love to walk among the happy
But if not for you love wouldn't know my name

I grew up picking cotton in the Mississippi sand
My mama said son take that girl and go make her your wife
Or you'll be stuck here in this mud all of your life
Will the water roll it all way this secret that I hold
Will the water roll it all away will it cleanse my aching soul
But a man's got to make it sometime a man's got to take a stand
Or he'll get left in the Mississippi sand
 A stranger came to town with two torn shoes upon his feet
Singing songs of sadness picking girls off of the street
He made a little bit of music was a leader of a band
And they call him the muddy Mississippi band
 My girl was Ruby Colter and she was on her teens
I took her out to churches to socials schools and things
She was a rose just right for picking and he nipped her in the bud
And he left her here in the Mississippi mud
Will the water roll it all way this secret that I hold
Will the water roll it all away will it cleanse my aching soul
But a man's got to make it sometime a man's got to take a stand
Or he'll get left in the Mississippi sand
 Then me and old Carl we caught him right down by the store
We choked him just a little bit and held him to the floor
We relived him of his pocketbook, his blood and other things
Now the Mississippi man's no longer mean
Will the water roll it all way this secret that I hold
Will the water roll it all away will it cleanse my aching soul

You've got to live and let your brother live as well

and let your love of livin' cast it's spell,
Gentle raindrops falling feed the streams that
keep on growing, till they build a raging river
deep and wide.
Now life is one big river, so if each man is a giver,
we might help to keep the ocean satisfied,

Layin back up in the mountains, singin songs for sunny days

Than wander through canyons of concrete and steel
Id rather laugh with the rain and sunshine
An lay down my sundown in some starry field
Oh, but I miss her in the mornin, when I awake alone
And the absence of her laughter is a cold and empty sound
But her memory always makes me smile and I want you to know

There's 15 cars, and 15 restless riders
3 conductors and 25 sacks of mail
All along a southbound odyssey, and the train pulls out of Kankakee
And rolls along past the houses, farms and fields
Passin' towns that have no name, and freightyards full of old grey men
The graveyards of the rusted automobiles
Singin' good mornin' America, how are you?
Sayin' don't you know me?, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done.
I was playin' cards with the old men in the club car.
Penny a point, ain't no one keepin' score
Pass the paper bag that holds that bottle.
I can hear the wheels rumblin' thru the floor.
And the sons of Pullman Porters, and the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpet made of steel
And their days are full of restless, and their dreams are full of mem'ries
And the echos of the freight train whistle's clear
Singin' good mornin' America, how are you?
Sayin' don't you know me?, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans

Half way home, and we'll be there by mornin'
With no tomorrow waiting 'round the bend

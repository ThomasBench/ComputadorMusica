0,Im From The Country (ver 2),Tracy Byrd,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tracy-byrd/im-from-the-country-chords-2352851,"Way back in the country, back in the hills,
Deep in the hollar where the folks are real,
Living with the crazy's and the ole wild cats,
With sot off shotguns and koon skinnned cats,
That's where I'm from and I'm proud to say,
I'm from the country and I like it that way.
Everybody knows everybody, everybody calls you friend,
You don't need no invitation,
kick off your shoes come on in,
Yeah, we know how to work and we know how to play,
We're from the country and we like it that way.
All day long we work in the fields,
Bring it all home for a home cooked meal,
We love you like Sunday,
treat you like Saturday night,
And when the beds get full we can sleep in the hay,
Hey, We're from the country and we like it that way
Everybody knows everybody, everybody calls you friend,
You don't need no invitation,
kick off your shoes come on in,
Yeah, we know how to work and we know how to play,
We're from the country and we like it that way.

1,Ellis Unit One,Steve Earle,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/steve-earle/ellis-unit-one-chords-1425507,"I was fresh out of the service 
It was back in ‘82 
I raised some Cain when I came back to town 
I meant to be all I could be 
Come home without a clue 
Married Dawn and had to settle down 
So I hired on at the prison 
Guess I always knew I would 
Just like my dad and both my uncles done 
Worked on every cell block 
Now, things're goin' good 
Then they transferred me to Ellis Unit One
Swing low 
Swing low 
Swing low and carry me home 
Now, my daddy used to talk about them long nights at the walls 
And how they used to strap ‘em in the chair 
The kids down from the college and they'd bring their beer ‘n all 
When the lights went out, a cheer rose in the air 
I guess  folks just got too civilized 
Old Sparky's gatherin' dust 
No one wants to touch a smokin' gun 
They got that injection  now
They don't mind as much, I guess 
Put ‘em down on Ellis Unit One 
Swing low 
Swing low 
Swing low and carry me home 
Well, I've seen ‘em fight like lions, boys 
I've seen 'em go like lambs 
And I've helped to drag ‘em when they could not stand 
And I've heard their mamas cryin' when they heard that big door slam 
I've seen the victim's family's holdin' hands 
Last night I dreamed that I woke up with straps across my chest 
And something cold and black pullin' through my lungs 
Even Jesus couldn't save me though I know he did his best 
But he don't live on Ellis Unit One

The joint starts jumpin every night when the sun goes down

It's where all the country folk go to boot scootin' boogie
I've got a good job. I work hard for my money.
I fire up my pickup truck & let the horses run
I go flyin' down that highway to that hide-a-way
Stuck out in the woods to do the boot scootin' boogie
Yeah, heel, toe, docie doe come on baby let's go boot scootin

Oh get down, turn around go to town boot scootin' boogie

in a state park by the highway 
and through the heavy pine trees 
ten-ton trucks go groaning by
Like the screams of your Aunt Barbara 
who went crazy in the 70's
wrote poems to Jimmy Carter 
but forgot to feed her kids
But it's the first time you're together 
since he got out of the hospital
Raccoons in the darkness 
drag off your hotdog buns
But, you're happy just to lie there 
in your plastic tent from Wal-Mart 
like sticks and fallen dead leaves 
to feed the fire of the world
But which is more important, 
to comfort an old woman 
or see visions of the heavens 
in the stumps of fallen trees?
Albert Einstein trembled 
when he saw that time was water, 
seeping through the rafters 
to put out this burning world
Next morning you're at Waffle House
Toast and eggs and hash browns
Truckers chain-smoke Camels 
over plastic cups of juice
And you remember how he cried 
when they strapped him to the stretcher, 
convinced his arms were burning 
with electricity from heaven
You remember how he told you 
that black holes were like Jesus
And the crucifix was a battery 
that filled the air with fire

Up where the rimrock meets the night
We'll go hand in hand
Ridin' through the purple star light
And the coyote on the wind
Sends his lonely lover's call
We'll hold each other close
In the wonder of it all
The golden west has come and gone
Right before our very eyes
But they will never count the stars
And they will never fence the skies
All I know is I love you
And I won't let you fall
We're rollin' down the Milky Way
Into the wonder of it all
Life gets harder every day
And sometimes it seems the dream almost dies
But love will find a way
It will show us the way through the canyons of the stars
And the endless midnight sky
Come on girl we're gonna ride
Where the rimrock meets the night
We'll go hand in hand
Ridin' through the purple starlight
And the coyote on the wind
Sends his lonely lover's call

And a day off and a bruised road However you might feel,
tonight is real
When I forget how to talk I sing Wont you please bring that
flash to shine? And turn my eyes red unless they close when you click
And my face gets sick, stuck like a question unposed
 Just climb aboard the tracks of trains arm
in my fragile family tree
And watch me floating inches above the people under me
Please beware the quiet front yard I warned you before
there were water skies  I warned you not to drive  Dry your eyes you poor devil
Are there really ones like these? The ones I dream float like leaves
And freeze to spread skeleton wings I passed through before I knew you
I believe its just because  Daddys payday is not enough
Oh I believe its all because Daddys payday is not enough
 Just climb aboard the tracks of trains arm

And that ole Cadillac
And the clothes that are on my back
I know that it ain't, a hell of a lot.
But it's all that I can show,
For 17 yrs makin my livin' ridin the rodeo.
My wife left me 5 yrs ago
In one of them rodeo towns
I c-ain't say that I blame her much,
She just wanted to settle down.
Oh God how I miss that woman
And it hurt so to see her go.
But if I was smart I woulda stuck by her
But I'm hooked on this rodeo.
Now I'm just a Lonesome Cowboy
I'm a little bit over the hill.
I shoulda quit this thing a long time ago
But I guess I never will
So I keep on movin from show to show hopin to change my luck.
My good ole days are all a memory
But I just can't give it up.
And bring home my share a dough
But now I'm losin out to the younger boys
I guess I must be gettin slow.
If there's one thing you learn from this,
You gotta make it on your own.
Cause when your on top you got a million friends
But when your down Buddy your all alone.

Coming through the screen
I'd crawl in your bed when the lightning flashed
And I'd still be there when the storm had passed
Dead to the world, to the morning cast

We lived on a street where the tall elm shade
Was as green as the grass and as cool as a blade
That you held in your teeth as we lay on our backs

We'd grown just as tall and as proud as we pleased

They wrapped us in paper and moved us away
Your room was no longer next door to mine

And feel like a blade at your throat

I think you should know well
The shape that I'm in
You tell me you wondered
If I was okay
Well, that's a damn fool thing to say
The water is wide
And you're always standing
On the other side
And then comes the moment
I wake in the dawn
With hours to lie here alone
And you seem so surprised
That I'm feeling this way
How am I so lonely today
If you ever loved me the way I loved you
You would be lonely too
For old times sake
Who don't hold each other
To the promise they break
And smile through the window
And wave on the street
'Cause that's all you want now from me
Now should I say something
To put you at ease
Or should I get down on my knees
If you ever loved me the way I loved you
Then you would be lonely too

No sound but the beat of her heart and mine
The smell of her hair was my first breath, and her lips were my first
And my first step was a headlong dive
I couldn't keep myself from falling, so she taught me to fly
And I was born in the summer of '75
In the morning light she wore my coat, and all I wanted to know
Was she trembling from the feeling or the cold
As the sleepy small town came to life, I saw the answer in her eyes
And knew I'd always have her hand to hold
Now somethings don't need saying, you just feel 'em deep inside
The way I felt in the summer of '75
Now all that seems like yesterday, how the time slips away
The blinding speed will leave you feeling cold
So when I feel the hands of time tugging at this life of mine
I reach for the warmest thing to hold
A light still shines on Locust Street, somewhere back in time
And I wake up to the beat of her heart and mine
And I reach out and touch her hair, just to know that she's still there
And the dream I had is still by my side
I might not make church on Sunday, but I thank the Lord each night
That I was born in the summer of '75
Yeah, I was born in the summer of '75

42,The Rivers Own,Chris Knight,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/chris-knight/the-rivers-own-chords-2131829,"The lines on my father''s face
Ran deep as creek beds on our place
And the river ran right through his soul
But I know at times it tooks its toll
When the crops would flood we lived on fish
But never did my father wish
To leave the land his life flowed from
The river and my dad were one
And I''m one of the river''s own
It''s current down inside me is strong
And it''s up to me to carry on
''Cause I''m one of the river''s own
As a kid I watched the river flow
Yeah, I admired the way it rocked and rolled
Dad was proud I was a river rat
But that''s where our common ground ended at
''Cause I seen those city lights downstream
And they drew me in when I was seven teen
I went everywhere that river runs
Yeah, me and that river we were one
And I''m one of the river''s own
It''s current down inside me is strong
And it''s up to me to carry on
''Cause I''m one of the river''s own
Two years ago dad passed away
And I''ll never forget that mournful day
Then a lawyer read me out his will
It said son, it''s time for you to be still
Then a week ago a government man
Tried to pay me off to flood our land
And I did just what my dad would''ve done
''Cause me and that river we are one
And I''m one of the river''s own
It''s current down inside me is strong
And it''s up to me to carry on
''Cause I''m one of the river''s own

We weren't much more than kids 
His family lived in a run down shack 
Like the rest of the white trash did 
Now me and ole William 
We used to smoke out behind the barn 
Til his daddy caught him stealing cigarettes 
I still think he broke William's arm 
When I was drinkin my first beer 
Ole William was getting high 
He got kicked out of school for fightin and drugs 
And he stayed out late at night 
He never said too much about home 
Or the bruises on his back 
I asked him about em one time 
But he never answered back 
Yeah William 
You grew up hard and mean 
You weren't the apple of your mama's eye 
And your daddy was a burned out fiend 
For what it's worth now William 
I know you could've had a heart of gold 
But I don't think you ever knew that you had one 
I don't think you were ever told 
He spent a year in reform school 
Cause he broke in a hardware store 
Now me and William lost track of each other 
I never saw him much anymore 
The last time I seen William 
He was married and had two kids 
He tried to raise em like he was supposed to 
But sometimes he raised em like his daddy did 
Yeah William 
You grew up hard and mean 
You weren't the apple of your mama's eye 
And your daddy was a burned out fiend 
For what it's worth now William 
I know you could've had a heart of gold 
But I don't think you ever knew that you had one 
I don't think you were ever told 
Well just last Sunday mornin 
Momma called me on the phone 
Said there's a story in the paper about William 
She just thought I might like to know 
He got shot by a city cop 
While he was robbin a local drugstore 
He was survived by two hungry kids, a wife 
and a pool of blood on the floor 
Yeah William 
You grew up hard and mean 
You weren't the apple of your mama's eye

Happens all the time
How does it feel to have a winning hand
From a first-rate failure to the
Leader in the chosen land
People never understand
If the world keeps spinning round
It'll be alright
You said if you were on your own
You could really fly
And while you're up there turn around
And touch the sky
I guess the point of getting out
Is never saying goodbye
You learn your lessons in the
Run out of patience
Lean on the bold face lie
People never wonder why
I feel too tired to scream and shout
Left in the sun
'til the colours all fade out
Prayin it'll all work out

You can barely hide the satisfaction on your face
Time takes another day, changes you in subtle ways
Lifts you up and slowly lets you go
Sitting there across the room, your smile looks like a breath
Living underneath the heel of what you might do next
Memory works in strange ways,
Cuts you down and makes you pay
One day you'll be walking,
by the next day life will hit you from behind
One heart, One love
Two people can rise above
Each Time    We fall
Don't know what I was thinking of
And don't say it's over
Don't say it's over
Don't let me be the last to know

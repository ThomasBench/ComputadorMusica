Oooh ----ooh ooh-----ooh that's what I do when I'm drinkin' about you---ooh ooh---ooh
So, I don't wanna go downtown, doin' what we used to
Twist the top off another round, hell I got enough loose screws
Getting tired of hurtin' bout you, nothin' ever changes
Think I'm gonna stay right here tonight
'Cause that could be dangerous
Cause that could be Dangerous
I could see me doin' just fine with a daisy duke dime but I don't see it lastin' long
I could see me ordering too many drinks at the bar get the bartender pourin' them strong
It's what I do when I'm trying to drink you gone
So, I don't wanna go downtown, doin' what we used to
Twist the top off another round, hell I got enough loose screws
Getting tired of hurtin' bout you, nothin' ever changes

Yeah cause you----ooo, got somebody else that you been
foo----lin,   Them same tricks up your sleeve, yeah
Ooo-----oOo,  I’d usually be the type to be out

       Building you a boat of gold filed with love and peace.
  I’ve a home, in this old valley, filled with tears and mud.
      If you sail up to me, you could bring back some love.
  Oh won’t you cry, a new day’s born. A new day today.
  Oh won’t you cry, a new day’s born. A new day today.
 One of us can be lonely. One of us can be sad
     Two can build together and walk hand in hand
 When I come to the end of my valley, reach my final home
       I hope you have been with me and held my hand all along.
  Oh won’t you cry, a new day’s born. A new day today.
  Oh won’t you cry, a new day’s born. A new day today.

2,Last Words,Steve Earle,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/steve-earle/last-words-chords-3503180,"     I was there when you were born
Took you from your momma's arms
Stood in awe, a witness to
The first breath that you ever drew
I wish I could have held you when
You left this world like I did then
Last time we spoke was on the phone
And we hung up and now you're gone
Last thing I said was, ""I love you""
And your last words to me were, ""I love you too""
I don't know why you hurt so bad
Just know you did, it makes me sad
Said everything I meant to say
I could not make it go away
Wherever  you are travelling now
It doesn't matter anyhow
Can't help but wonder if you knew
You took a part of me away with you
Last thing I said was, ""I love you""
And your last words to me were, ""I love you too""
You made me laugh, you made me cry
You showed me truth, you told me lies
You tore my heart apart and then
You brought me back the piece again
Now I don't know what I'll do
Until the day I follow you
Through the darkness to the light
'Cause I loved you for all your life
Last thing I said was, ""I love you""
And your last words to me were, ""I love you too""

You look me in the eye  you say you don't believe me

You can't feel a thing  if you can't find a spark
I want fire  to burn through the rain
Higher and higher  in the winds of change
I want to feel  every ounce of pain
But when the smoke clears  only love remains
So i'll be on my way  don't know where i'm going
But you should do the same  cause there's no way of knowing
Who i never was  and who you really are
You can't feel the flames if you can't find a spark
I want fire  to burn through the rain
Higher and higher  in the winds of change
I want to feel  every ounce of pain
But when the smoke clears  only love remains
I was gonna take my time  wasn't in a hurry
But someone changed my mind  vision got blurry
I could barely breathe  started to choke
But now i believe  we're ready to smoke
There's fire  burning through the rain
Higher and higher  in the winds of change
I can feel  every ounce of pain

 Sure as hell ain't for lack of tryin'
 There’s no use wastin' time in   fightin' for somethin'
 When you see that white flag a flyin'
Can you hear that whistle blow?
There's all-day thinkin' time
And all night drinkin' time
And time to sing or time to find if
Rhyme has a reason
Time to pack it in and stay down
Pack it up and walk away now
And give it one more day or call it a season
I can tell by the tears not in your eyes
It’s quittin' time
 There's somethin' to be said for   sayin' what needs sayin'
   Suitcase says it all to me
 Before the credits roll just know I always lovеd you
So we wrote that famous final scenе
Where you turn and walk out on me
There's all-day thinkin' time
And all night drinkin' time
And time to sing or time to find if
Rhyme has a reason
Time to pack it in and stay down
Pack it up and walk away now
And give it one more day or call it a season
I can tell by the tears not in your eyes
It’s quittin' time
It’s quittin' time

Every first has a last
Every now has a then
Every future has a past
And sometimes you want it back
There's all-day thinkin' time
And all night drinkin' time
And time to sing or time to find if
Rhyme has a reason
Time to pack it in and stay down
Pack it up and walk away now
And give it one more day or call it a season

 And now you're big-time diggin' on some little bitty
Backroads, real slow
Got your hand out the window
 Now you took a little ride around the farm
 Got to do a little fishin' in the dark
 Wrapped up in some country boy arms
Now you know what it's about
Whatcha think of country now?
 Halfway down your first country mile

 From a blanket on a bank of a creek bed
 And I can tell you were hooked soon as you said
""Don't take me home, boy I ain't had enough yet""
 Now you took a little ride around the farm
 Got to do a little fishin' in the dark
 Wrapped up in some country boy arms

A lady down on love
And out of hopes and dreams
The ties that once bound her
Now had broke away
And she's just like a baby
That's learning how to play
She never thought that love
Could ever end so soon
Her mind drifts back in time
To a mid-summer moon
When he asked her to marry
And she gladly said okay
And a woman came to be
From the girl of yesterday
Now she's a lady
Down on love
She needs somebody
To gеntly pick her up
    She's got her freedom,
But shе'd rather be bound
To a man who would love her
And never let her down
Well, I know a lady
Who's down on her love
'Cause I used to hold her
And have that special touch
But work took me away
From home late at night
And I just wasn't there
When  she turned out the lights
Then both of us got lonely,
I gave in to lust
And she just couldn't live
With a man she couldn't trust
Now she's a lady
Down on love
She needs somebody
To gently pick her up
    She's got her freedom,
But she'd rather be bound
To a man who would love her
And never let her down

From the only two things that get me out of this bind
A book of matches and a bottle of wine
Got closets and boxes and drawers to go through
Of letters and sweaters and pictures of you
Got a fire pit dug and a made up mind
A book of matches and a bottle of wine
Gonna pop that cork, gonna light this fire
Feed the flames, get higher and higher
Watch as one last time
Let these memories shine
With a book of matches and a bottlе of wine
'Til that last drop of cheap Merlot
'Til thе final embers glow
I'll watch as one last time
Let these memories shine
Sitting here thinking, wished that I'd known
It'd be this easy letting you go
But I'm destroying all proof you ever were mine
With a book of matches and a bottle of wine
And I'm killing your memory with my partners in crime
A book of matches and a bottle of wine

An old junk car full of worthless stuff
Didn't have a clue, but I'd had enough
 Turned the key, hit the gas and headed out
And even though it hurt to see my mama cry
It was good to say goodbye
At twenty-five, wild and free
 Thought the world revolved around me
Living loud, spinning out of control
 Drinking nights, wasting days
I was in a real bad place
What she saw in me, Heaven only knows
'Cause she helped me leave my demons all behind
And it felt good to say goodbyе
There's a part of you that wants to stay right therе
Right where you are
But if you never walk away
Then you won't get very far
Hadn't talked to dad in years
 Mama called and I could hear her tears
Said, ""Daddy's fading, don't know how long he has""
 Drove all night to get back home
And talk with him in his room alone
 Laid to rest all the anger from the past
And it was hard for me to swallow all my pride
But it was good to say goodbye

Comes from somewhere high up above, and that’s the courage of love
And any fool can pull the trigger, anyone can start a fight
But to love is so much bigger, and so beyond what's black or white
And if we're gonna give our children the future that is bright
Then the truth must be the answer and love is the light

Then you gotta love someone more than yourself

Ah but she's my voice of reason
Yeah, I'm a 737 on a runway
She's a slow rolling Chevy on a Sunday
And I'm a walk on the wild side
Ah but she's my,
She's my come to Jesuus
(And she brings heaven a little closer)
She's my come to Jesuuus
Oh oh
Hey, I been known to fly a little close to the sun sometimes
And I, I go a little too hard on a Friday night, yeah
I'm pretty good at getting her heart running
She's pretty good at reigning me in
Half the time she's talking me out of it
Half the time I'm talking her in, cause
I'm the little devil on her shoulder
And she brings heaven a little closer
I take her outside of the lines
Ah but she's my voice of reason
I'm a 737 on a runway
She's a slow rolling Chevy on a Sunday
And I'm a walk on the wild side
Ah but she's my,
She's my come to Jesu-u-u-us
Oh yeah
Hey, I'm a little rock n roll
And she's all hands up hallelujah
She's good for my soul
And somehow I'm good for her too yeah
I'm the little devil on her shoulder
And she brings heaven a little closer
I take her outside of the lines
Ah but she's my voice of reason
I'm a 737 on a runway
She's a slow rolling Chevy on a Sunday
And I'm a walk on the wild side
Ah but she's my,
She's my come to Jesuus
I'm pretty good at getting her heart running
 Mmm, mmm, mmm, hmm
Half the time she's talking me out of it
She know I'm gonna talk her back in
'Cause, I'm the little devil on her shoulder
And she brings heaven a little closer
I take her outside of the lines
Ah but she's my voice of reason
Yeah, I'm a 737 on a runway
She's a slow rolling Chevy on a Sunday
And I'm a walk on the wild side
Ah but she's my,
She's my come to Jesuus
(And she brings heaven a little closer)
She's my come to Jesuuus
Oh oh

  Welcome to Georgia on a big blue highway sign
You were drinkin' Cola from a straw with red and white stripes
 Half priced fireworks from a stand outside of a Texaco
We were Tennessee to South Savannah
Head back laughin', sunlight dancin’
Had a little piece of Heaven in a four door
Heartbeats beating like your feet on the floorboard
 Ooh, and nothing felt better
 It felt likе forever
For a little whilе
Mixtapes, long drives, singin' to One Headlight
 Tall pines, state lines, take me back in time
We were Tennessee to South Savannah
Head back laughin', sunlight dancin’
Had a little piece of Heaven in a four door
Heartbeats beating like your feet on the floorboard
 Ooh, and nothing felt better
 It felt likе forever
For a little whilе
It felt like forever, felt like forever
Felt like forever, felt like forever
When I said I love you, I said I love you
It felt like forever, felt like forever
We were Tennessee to South Savannah
Head back laughin', sunlight dancin’
Had a little piece of Heaven in a four door
Heartbeats beating like your feet on the floorboard
Ooh, and nothing felt better
 It felt likе forever fooor a little whiiiiiiilе
Felt like forever, oh, it felt like
When I said I love you, I said I love you
It felt like forever, felt like forever
For a little while

My only friend was the sun and the wind to my back on the road I was walkin’
Nowhere to go, no one to know when I got there
Til’ I met you, I had nothing to lose and if I did, I didn’t care
Now this lone wolf is done runnin’ down the moon
In the daylight dark of the night this heart is howlin’ for you
Yeah, this lone wolf ain’t lonely anymore
‘Cause you weren’t afraid to reach out and save a lone wolf at your door
Inside I still gotta wild side with a taste for good and gone
Yeah, your love likes all my inside out and leaves my porch light on
You sprung my cage, red lined my gauge and fueled a fire
Yeah, your hand in mine makes my heart soar like a hallelujah choir
Now this lone wolf is done runnin’ down the moon
In the daylight dark of the night this heart is howlin’ for you
Yeah, this lone wolf ain’t lonely anymore
‘Cause you weren’t afraid to reach out and save a lone wolf at your door
‘Cause you weren’t afraid to reach out and save a lone wolf at your door
This lone wolf
This lone wolf
This lone wolf
This lone wolf

48,5 To 9,Dolly Parton,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/dolly-parton/5-to-9-chords-3550757,"Well, I tumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumping
Out on the streets, the traffic starts jumping
With folks like me on the job from nine to five
Working nine to five, what a way to make a living
Barely getting by, it's all taking and no giving
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
Working five to nine, you've got passion and a vision
'Cause it's hustlin' time, a whole new way to makе a livin'
Gonna change your life, do something that givеs it meaning
With a website that is worthy of your dreaming
Well, you've got dreams and you know they matter
Be your own boss, climb your own ladder
That moment's getting closer by the day
And you're in the same boat with a lotta your friends
Launching ideas you all believe in
The tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll your way
Working five to nine, makin' something of your own now
And it feels so fine to build a business from your know-how
Gonna move ahead, and there's nothin' that you can't do
When you listen to that little voice inside you, yeah
  Five to nine, you've got passion and a vision
'Cause it's hustlin' time, a whole new way to make a livin'
Gonna change your life, do something that gives it meaning
With a website that is worthy of your dreaming
Five to nine
You keep workin' workin' workin'
Workin' five to nine
Workin' five to nine
You keep dreamin' dreamin' dreamin'
Five to nine, five to nine
You can do it (Ooh)

I got my halo and my horns
Lived in the dark and I've seen the light
I walk between the black and white
I'm hellfire mixed with holy water
I'm a blue sky hurricane
If you can't have one without the other
Do you still want all of me?
What if I fall and I can't fly?
I'm not what your heart had in mind
For what it's worth, you know I'll try
So if I slip, could you let it slide?
(Slide) your hand in mine, never let it leap
(Slide) into my dreams when I go to sleep
(Slide) out of that dress, into this bed
Right by my side, baby slide
 What if I fall and I can't fly?
I'm not what your heart had in mind
For what it's worth, you know I'll try
So if I slip, could you let it slide?

I been living fast loving hard
And I'm starting to show my age
I don't care if what I'm doing leads me to an early grave
When I die don't you hang your head and cry
I'll be heading for that big ol' honky tonk up in the sky
Let that lonesome whistle moan mama tried
   Put my body in a boxcar and send me to the other side
I been singing Waymore's Blues every Saturday night
Then amazing grace on Sunday and I saw the light
I got songs about running around trains and the hell I raise
I got a Haggard heart but the ragged soul's o-k

 Bedroom in the basement
Parents' house, Tucson, Arizona
What do expect from a high school diploma?
  Working hours in the shoe store
Selling dimes out the back door
And he puts on his prom crown
Says to his Mama, ""I'm the king of this town""
Won't you take me out?
I hear the midnight streets a-calling
You can hold me down
But like a bird I'm just free falling
 Here's to these American nights
 We're having the time of our lives
Living, dreaming, feeling, never sleeping
Till we see the morning light
On these American nights (Hey)                   (Hey)
Neighborhood kid, just back from the desert
Tattoo and a discharge letter
VA in the Saint John
Six times a week he still sleeps with his boots on
She skipped track up to Brooklyn
With a dream and some tanned skin
Graveyard at The Rhino
This is the place where the stars shine, y'know?
Won't you take me out?
I hear the midnight streets a-calling
You can hold me down
But like a bird I'm just free falling

Till we see the morning light

And nothing good lasts forever
12-gauge heart in a machine-gun town
Whole life running, ya can't stop now

Living on a feeling, got a feeling
That it's gonna be alright

Canola fields on a July day
Are about the same chartreuse as that sixty-nine bug
You used to drive around San Jose
You never knew where my old white Lincoln might take you
Party on wheels with suicide doors
Bring the kids and the dogs and your grandma too
We always had room for more
Til that white-knuckle ride back from Santa Cruz
Second-best surfer on the central coast
Had you wrapped up all the way back to Los Gatos
And I could've cut his throat
And it wasn't like we were an item to start with
It had no basis in fact
But the whiskey could push me to sudden extremes
I don't want to think about that,
I don't want to think about that
Take my hand Marie
Take a death grip on some part of me
Keep me from drifting far out to sea
Or I'll be lost out       there
We all filtered away with the days getting shorter
Seeking our place in the greater scheme
Kids and careers and a vague sense of order
Busting apart at the seams
I heard you switched coasts, moved in with your sister
I doubt you'd have called it familial bliss
We met up in Brooklyn before it went hipster
You carried your keys in your fist
In a way back corner of a cross-town bus
We were hiding out under my hat
Cashing in on a thirty-year crush
You can't be young and do that
You can't be young and do that
Take my hand Marie
Take a death grip on some part of me
Keep me from drifting far out to sea
Or I'll be lost out       there

Canola fields at harvest time
Look like tumbleweeds all raked up into rows
Brown rusty contour lines
And there's not much moving on the romance radar
Not that I'm craving it all that much
But I still need to feel every once in a while
The warmth of a smile and a touch
In a way back corner of a cross-town bus
We were hiding out under my hat
Cashing in on a thirty-year crush

A honky-tonkin' Halloween
A little Louisiana ca-vi-ar
And somethin' for the mason jar
And head to New Orleans
You know you best be gettin' out of the way
When the sailors say ""Laissez les bon temp rouler""
Means there's gonna be a big parade
Up and down the street
They'll be cookin' up that étouffée
Jambalaya and sweet beignets
Ça c'est bon's the way the Cajun's say
Oh, bon appetit
Who dat goin' to the Mardi Gras?

It's just this big-ass party, y'all
A honky-tonkin' Halloween
So bring a fiddle and an old guitar
A little Louisiana ca-vi-ar
And somеthin' for the mason jar
And head to New Orlеans
In the bayou with Marie Laveau
Little voodoo and Zydeco
Makes you jump and holler ""hi-de-ho""
Oh, you know I guar-on-tee
From the Quarter to the Pontchartrain
Things are gonna get a bit insane
Since they've never made a pair the same
Best to bring a lot of beads

It's like nothin' that you ever saw
It's just this big-ass party, y'all
A honky-tonkin' Halloween
A little Louisiana ca-vi-ar

Callin' all sinners and saints
Jump in the gumbo, you can have fun
No matter what you are you ain't
Get down to the Mardi Gras
It's like nothin' that you ever saw
It's just this big-ass party, y'all

44,Worship What I Hate (ver 2),Lady A (Lady Antebellum),https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lady-a-lady-antebellum/worship-what-i-hate-chords-3771884,"I keep looking at myself in the mirror
Hopin' it will change
And I keep wishing for a brand-new body
That I didn't have to blame
I'm seeing every flaw, like a failure
I'm using every cure, like a savior
Like tryna build a church out of all my hurt
When it really needs grace
I gave all my time to nothing
I focused on who I was not who I'm becoming
My fears, they took up space
My eyes couldn't look away
I didn't even realize I worshiped what I hate
Half a bottle of red just before bed
Is the only way I dream
Before I rеally wake up
The first thing I touch is a button on a screen
I'm not guilty of leavin', not stickin' around
I'm guilty of stayin' and just chеckin' out
Yeah, I kept my head down and really missed out
On what's in front of me
I gave all my time to nothing
I focused on who I was not who I'm becoming
My fears, they took up space
My eyes couldn't look away
I didn't even realize I worshiped what I hate
Why do the lies feel like the truth?
Why do I do the things I do?
Why do I fight so hard to keep my heart empty?
I gave all my time to nothing
I focused on who I was not who I'm becoming
My fears, they took up space
My eyes couldn't look away
I didn't even realize I worshiped what I hate
I didn't even realize (Realize)

Didn't even realize I worshiped what I hate

Willie built that beautiful thing
   They’d crank Metallica up real loud
Jump around the room and sing
   Sing from their hearts, from their throats
Singin’ at the top of their lungs
  Till the neighbors from all sides complained
To the cops who’d never come
Love me like I wanna be loved
Love me like I wanna be loved
Singing, love me like I wanna be loved
Love me like I wanna be loved
Love me like I wanna be loved
They drank all night and they slept all day
In that Polk Street SRO
  When the sun went down
They crushed some ice
Ordered Chinese to go
   And turned that stereo again real loud
Singing at the top of their lungs
   Till the neighbors got the broomsticks out
Called the cops who’d never come
Love me like I wanna be loved
Love me like I wanna be loved
Singing, love me like I wanna be loved
Love me like I wanna be loved
Love me like I wanna be loved
  Nilli said, “I had a body once
Willie, you have no idea
  I could make a grown man bark all night
Anytime, anywhere”
   Willie said, “I had a lion’s mane,
Now I sing at the top of my lungs
  Till the neighbors get the broomsticks out
And the cops all sing along”

And you find yourself lost and all your confidence is gone
And the stars over your head through the clouds won't be revealed
I'll walk with you, even if it's uphill
When the weight of your troubles sends your knees into the dirt
And all your loyal distractions only magnify the hurt
When lonesome doesn't quite define how so alone you feel
I'll walk with you, even if it's uphill
   Hard times and landslides are part of life, I know
Like they say, ""None of us get out alive""
Whatever ocean you're swimming across, however valley low
  Whatever mountains you climb
I'll walk with you, even if it's uphill
Blessed are the times filled with sun, surrounded by your friends
Those days when all the new roads wait right where the old roads end
But should you wake up to Everest right outside your windowsill
I'll walk with you, even if it's uphill
   Hard times and landslides are part of life, God knows
We all got some mountains to climb
Whatever ocean you're swimming across, however valley low
I'm right here, I've been right here all this time
And I'll walk with you, even if it's uphill
I'll walk with you, even if it's uphill

SAID JUST TAKE HER OUT FOR DRINKS AND A MOVIE
TRUST ME MAN YOU DON’T WANNA PASS THIS UP
SO I GAVE IN ON A SATURDAY NIGHT
CALLED HER UP JUST TO GIVE IT A TRY
SHE WALKED IN LOOKING JUST LIKE LOVE
AFTER A COUPLE ROUNDS HER LIPS KISSED MY MOUTH
MY HEART STARTED BEATIN’ THINKIN’ THIS WAS
GONNA ALL WORK OUT
TILL IT FELT LIKE YOU, IT FELT LIKE MOVING ON
AND I WAS STRONG BUT I WAS WRONG
THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO
I WAS CAUGHT UP IN THE MOMENT
SHE WAS SOMETHING THAT I WANTED
TILL IT FELT LIKE YOU OOH-OOH-OOH
TILL IT FELT LIKE YOU
SHE’S HOTTER THAN AN ALABAMA JULY
NOTHING BUT WANT TO IN HER BLUE EYES
SIGNS ALL SAID HOW THIS NIGHT COULD END
THE HONEY IN HER VOICE WHISPERED IN MY EAR
WHATCHA THINK LETS GET OUT OF HERE
TRUTH BE TOLD I WAS ALL IN
TILL IT FELT LIKE YOU, IT FELT LIKE MOVING ON
AND I WAS STRONG BUT I WAS WRONG
THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO

 It's the 4th of July
I get to wake up in your freedom
But sometimes I wonder why
Seems like everybody's pissin'
 On the red, white, and blue
 Happy birthday America
Whatever's left of you  ///
You were the darlin' when you saved the world
 WW one and two
 France would be part of Germany now
If it hadn't been for you
   Now your children want to turn you in
To something  other than yourself
They burn your flag in their city streets
 More than anybody else
 Happy birthday America
 It's the 4th of July
I'll get to wake up in your freedom
But sometimes I wonder why
Seems like everybody's pissin'
 On the red, white, and blue
 Happy birthday America
Whatever's left of you
 Who they gonna count on
When you're not there to take their call
Will the world keep right on spinnin'
Without the greatest of them all
 Witout the helping hand of God
Your days are numbered my old friend
 We're sure gonna miss you girl
You wre the best that's ever been
Happy birthday Americaaaaaa
 All the broken down cities
By the left's design
 And the right can't seem to get it right
 Most of the time
 Every time I go to town and vote
 I just come home with the blues
 The lesser of two evils
 All we ever get to choose
 Happy birthday America
 It's the 4th of July
I get to wake up in your freedom
But sometimes I wonder why
Seems like everybody's pissin'
 On the red, white, and blue
 Happy birthday America
Whatever's left of you

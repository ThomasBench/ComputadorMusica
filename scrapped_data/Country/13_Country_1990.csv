But you won't, no you won't
Cause I can't make you love me,   if you don't even try
I'll close my eyes, then I won't see
The love you don't feel, when you're holding me
Morning will come and I'll do what's right
Give me till then, to give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

to share with you the last bite of bread I had to eat
I would swim out to save you in your sea of broken dreams
When all your hopes are sinking, let me show you what love means
Love can build a bridge, between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge, dont you think it's time, don't you think its time
I would whisper love so loudly, ev'ry heart would understand
That love and only love, can join the tribes of man
I would give my heart's desire, so that you might see
The first step is to realize, that it all begins with you and me
Love can build a bridge, between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge, don't you think it's time,don't you think its time

When we stand together, it's our finest hour, we can do anything, anything
If we keep believin' in the power

 They'd dig for silver and for gold and leave the empty holes

 The eagles fly and the otters play in the land of the Seminole

 I'm callin' to you like a long-lost friend but I know who you are
 And blow, blow from the Okeechobee all the way up to Micanopy
 Blow across the home of the Seminole the alligators and the gar 
 Progress came and took its toll and in the name of flood control
 They made their plans and they drained the land 
 Now the Glades are goin' dry 
 And the last time I walked in the swamp I stood up on a cypruss stump
 I listened close and I heard the ghost of Oseola cry 
 So blow, blow Seminole wind blow like you're never gonna blow again

7,Feelin Good Again (ver 2),Robert Earl Keen,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/robert-earl-keen/feelin-good-again-chords-1451898,"Standing out on Main Street across from Mr. Blues
In my faded leather jacket and my weathered Brogan shoes
A chill north wind was blowing but the spring was coming on
As I wondered to myself just how long I had been gone
So I strolled across old Main Street, walked down a flight of stairs
Stepped into the hall and saw all my friends were there
A neon sign was flashing ""Welcome come on in""
It feels so good, feeling good again
My favorite band was playing an Otis Redding song
When they sang the chorus, everybody sang along
Dan and Margarita were swaying side by side
I heard they were divorcing, but I guess they let it slide
And I wished I had some money, with which to buy a round
I wished I'd cashed my paycheck before I came to town
But I reached into my pocket found three twenties and a ten
Feels so good, feeling good again
There was old man Perkins sitting on his stool
Watching Butch and Jimmy John talking loud and playing pool
The boys from Silver City were standing by the fire
Singing like they though they were the Tabernacle choir
And I wanted you to see them all I wished that you were there
I looked across the room and saw you standing on the stair
And when I caught your eye, I saw you break into a grin
It feels so good, feeling good again.
And I wanted you to see them all I wished that you were there

Nothin’ worse could ever happen
But seeing you with someone else/
Proved that I was wrong
And when your eyes met mine, I knew/
That you were gone forever
Along with all the reasons I had for hanging on
I’d be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back to Georgia
Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time
I think I’d rather die and go to hell and face the devil/
Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind
I always thought that someday, we might get back together
I just thought you needed time/
To spread your wings and fly
But when I saw the loving way you held onto each other/
It was all that I could do, not to break right down and cry

On a slow train back to Georgia

Oh, the snowflakes fell in silence
Over Belleau Wood that night
For a Christmas truce had been declared
By both side of the fight
As we lay there in our trenches
The silence broke in two
By a German soldier singing
A song that we all knew
Though I did not know the language
The song was ""Silent Night""
Then I heard my buddy whisper,
""All is calm and all is bright""
Then the fear and doubt surrounded me
'Cause I'd die if I was wrong
But I stood up in my trench
And I began to sing along
	Then across the frozen battlefield
	Another's voice joined in
	Until one by one each man became
	A singer of the hymn
Then I thought that I was dreaming
For right there in my sight
Stood the German soldier
'Neath the falling flakes of white
And he raised his hand and smiled at me
As if he seemed to say
Here's hoping we both live
To see us find a better way
	Then the devil's clock struck midnight
	And the skies lit up again
	And the battlefield where heaven stood
	Was blown to hell again
But for just one fleeting moment
The answer seemed so clear
Heaven's not beyond the clouds
It's just beyond the fear
No, heaven's not beyond the clouds
It's for us to find it here

I would give you my heart,
Be all that you need,
Show you you're everything that's precious to me,
If you give me a chance,
I can love you like that
I never make a promise,
I don't intend to keep,
So when I say forever,
Forever's what I mean.
I'm no Cassanova,
And what I say is true,
I'll be holding nothing back,
When it comes to you.
You want tenderness, I got tenderness
To see you through, to the heart of you
If you want a man, who can understand,
You don't have to look very far

And the next thing that I knew, there we were, lost in conversation
Before I handed her her purse,
I said you'll only get this back on one condition
And we danced
Out there on that empty hardwood floor
The chairs up and the lights turned way down low
The music played we held each other close
And we danced
And we danced
Like no one else had ever danced before
I can't explain what happened on that floor

Put out the fire in your head

There were people running a flash of light Then everything changed

She loved him like no one before, it was good to be alive
But sometimes that can slip away as fast As any fingers through your hands
So you let time forgive the past and go and make some other plans

Where the cactus flowers grow
I was wishing that the world would stop
When you said ""We'd better go""
We took a row boat across the Rio Grande
Captain Pablo was our guide
For two dollars in a weathered hand
He rowed us to the other side
We were dreaming like
The end was not in sight
And we dreamed all afternoon
We asked the world to wait
So we could celebrate
A gringo honeymoon
We stepped out onto the golden sand
The sun was high and burning down
Rented donkeys from an old blind man
Saddled up and rode to town
Tied our donkeys to an Ironwood tree
By the stream where children play
We went in the first place we could see
Serving cold beer in the shade
We were drinking like
The end was not in sight
And we drank all afternoon
We asked the world to wait
So we could celebrate
A gringo honeymoon
Met a cowboy who said that he
Was running from the D.E.A
He left his home, wife, and family
When he made his get away
We'd followed him on down a street of dust
To his run-down, one-room shack
He blew a smoke ring and he smiled at us
""I ain't never goin' back""
We were flying like
The end was not in sight
And we soared that afternoon
We asked the world to wait
So we could celebrate
A gringo honeymoon
He said ""There's one last place that you should go""
He took us to the town's best bar
He knew a crusty caballero
Who played an old gut-string guitar
And he sang like Marty Robbins could
Played like no one I've known
For a while we knew that life was good
It was ours to take back home
We were singing like
The end was not in sight
And we sang all afternoon
We asked the world to wait
So we could celebrate
A gringo honeymoon
We were standing on a mountain top
Where the cactus flowers grow
I was wishing that the world would stop
When you said we'd better go

She's been goin' out with me
Said she'd let us know by tonight
Which one it would be
So I waited by the phone
But she never called me up
Had to know what was goin' on
So, I drove by her house and sure enough
That ain't my truck in her drive
Man this ain't my day tonight
Looks like she's in love and I'm out of luck
That ain't my shadow on her wall
Lord this don't look good at all
That's my girl my whole world
But that ain't my truck
I pulled over by the curb
I've been sittin' here all night
Wonderin' what it was I did so wrong
That he did so right
I've thought of breakin' down her door
But there's nothin' left to say
That chevy four-by-four
Says it all sittin' in my place
That ain't my truck in her drive
Man this ain't my day tonight
Looks like she's in love and I'm out of luck

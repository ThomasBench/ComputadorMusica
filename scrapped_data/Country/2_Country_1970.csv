0,Angel Flying Too Close To The Ground,Willie Nelson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/willie-nelson/angel-flying-too-close-to-the-ground-chords-77920,"If you had not have fallen
Then I would not have found you
Angel flying too close to the ground
I patched up your broken wing and hung around for a while
Trying to keep your spirits up and your fever down
I knew someday that you would fly away
For love's the greatest healer to be found
So leave me if you need to I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground
Fly on  fly on past the speed of sound
I'd rather see you up than see you down
So leave me if you need to I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground
So leave me if you need to I will still remember
Angel flying too close to the ground

and said boy let me tell you what
I guess you didn't know it
cause I think I'm better than you 
Johnny, you rosin up your bow
and play your fiddle hard
Cause hell’s broke loose in Georgia
and the Devil deals it hard
And if you win you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the Devil gets your soul
The Devil opened up his case
and it sounded something like this 
When the Devil finished Johnny said
Fire on the mountain, run boys run
The Devil's in the house of the risin' sun
Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough
Granny does your dog bite no, child, no
The Devil bowed his head
Fire on the mountain, run boys run
The Devil's in the house of the risin' sun
The chicken in the bread pan are pickin' out dough
Granny will your dog bite no, child, no

But lately some of my kinfolks have disowned a few others and me.
I guess it's because I kind of changed my direction.
Lord I guess I went and broke their family tradition.
They get on me and want to know Hank why do you drink? Why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
Over and over everybody makes my predictions.
So if I get stoned, I'm just carrying on an old family tradition.
I am very proud of my daddy's name
All though his kind of music and mine ain't exactly the same.
Stop and think it over. Put yourself in my position.
If I get stoned and sing all night long it's a family tradition.
So don't ask me, Hank why do you drink? Hank, why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?
If I'm down in a honky-tonk some ole slick's trying to give me friction.
I said leave me alone I'm singing all night long it's a family tradition.
Lord I have loved some ladies and I have loved Jim Beam
And they both tried to kill me in 1973.
When that doctor asked me, Son how did you get in this condition?
I said, hey sawbones, I'm just carrying on an ole family tradition.
So don't ask me, Hank why do you drink? Hank, why do you roll smoke?

6,The Gambler,Kenny Rogers,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/kenny-rogers/the-gambler-chords-82135,"On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere,
I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness
'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.
He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.
And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice.""
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow.
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.
Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
know when to walk away and know when to run.
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.
Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep.
'Cause ev'ry hand's a winner and ev'ry hand's a loser,
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.""
And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
know when to walk away and know when to run.
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.

Well I was drunk the day my mom got out of prison

wasn't bad so I had one more for dessert

my clothes and found my cleanest dirty shirt
and I shaved my face and combed my hair
and stumbled down the stairs to meet the day
I'd smoked my brain the night before
on cigarettes and songs that I've been pickin'
cussin' at a can that he was kicking
Then I crossed the empty street and caught
the Sunday smell of someone fryin' chicken
and it took me back to somethin' that
I'd lost somehow somewhere along the way

that makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
half as lonesome as the sound
on the sleepin' city sidewalks
Sunday mornin' comin' down
In the park I saw a daddy with
a laughing little girl who he was swingin'
and listened to the song that they were singin'
Then I headed back for home and
somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
and it echoed thru the canyon like
the disappearing dreams of yesterday.

He's watching people everywhere, he knows who does and doesn't care
And I'm an ordinary man, sometimes I wonder who I am
But I believe in love,  I believe in music
I believe in magic,    and I believe in you
Well, I know with all my certainty what's going on with you and me
Is a good thing.     It's true,   I believe in you
I don't believe virginity is as common as it used to be
In working days and sleeping nights, that black is black and white is white
That Superman and Robin Hood are still alive in Hollywood
That gasoline's in short supply, the rising cost of getting by
But I believe in love,     I believe in old folks
I believe in children,     and I believe in you
But I believe in love,    I believe in babies
I believe in Mom and Dad,    and I believe in you

15,The Gambler (ver 4),Kenny Rogers,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/kenny-rogers/the-gambler-chords-1062394,"On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere,
I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness
'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.
He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.
And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice.""
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow.
Then he bummed a cigarette, and asked me for a light.
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.
Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
know when to walk away and know when to run.
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.
Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep.
'Cause ev'ry hand's a winner and ev'ry hand's a loser,
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.""
And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
know when to walk away and know when to run.
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way,
When all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw,
Plowin' through the ragged sky, and up a cloudy draw,
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel,
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel,
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky,
For he saw the riders coming hard, and he heard their mournful cry.
Yippe-ai - oh,   yippee-a i- ay,  (Coyote Yip)
Ghost riders in the sky,
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat,
He's ridin' hard to catch that herd but he ain't caught them yet,
Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky,
All horses snortin' fire, as they ride on, hear them cry.
As the riders loped on by him, he heard one call his name,
If you want to save your soul from hell, a ridin' on our  range,
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride,
Trying to catch the devil's herd, across these endless skies.
Yippe-ai - oh,   yippee-ai - ay,     (Coyote Yip)

28,Red Headed Stranger,Willie Nelson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/willie-nelson/red-headed-stranger-chords-890485,"The red headed stranger from Blue Rock, Montana,
Rode into town one day.
And under his knees, was a raging black stallion,
Walking behind was a bay.
The red headed stranger had eyes like thunder,
And his lips they were sad and tired.
His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside,
And his heart was as heavy as night.
Don't cross him, don't boss him,
He's wild in his sorrow,
Ridin' and hidin' his pain.
Don't fight him, don't spite him,
Just wait 'til tomorrow,
Maybe he'll ride on again.
Yellow haired lady leaned out of her window,
Watched as he passed her way.
She drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion,
But cast greedy eyes on the bay.
How could she know that the dancin' bay pony
Meant more to him than life?
This was the horse that his little lost darlin'
Had ridden when she was his wife.
Don't cross him, don't boss him,
He's wild in his sorrow,
Ridin' and hidin' his pain.
Don't fight him, don't spite him,
Just wait 'til tomorrow,
Maybe he'll ride on again.
Yellow haired lady came down to the tavern,
And looked up the stranger there.
He bought her a drink and gave her some money,
He just didn't seem to care.
She followed him out as he saddled the stallion,
And laughed as she grabbed at the bay.
He shot her so quick they had no time to warn her,
She never heard anyone say:
Don't cross him, don't boss him,
He's wild in his sorrow,
Ridin' and hidin' his pain.
Don't fight him, don't spite him,
Just wait 'til tomorrow,
Maybe he'll ride on again.
The yellow haired lady was buried at sunset,
The stranger went free of course.
For you can't hang a man for killing a woman,
Who's trying to steal your horse.
This is the tale of the red headed stranger
And if he should pass your way,
Stay out of path of the ragin' black stallion
And don't lay a hand on the bay.
Don't cross him, don't boss him,
He's wild in his sorrow,
Ridin' and hidin' his pain.
Don't fight him, don't spite him,
Just wait 'til tomorrow,
Maybe he'll ride on again.

Then leave them the words of a sad country song
My heroes have always been cowboys
And they still are it seems
Sadly in search of  but one step in back of
Themselves and their slow moving dreams
Cowboys are special with their own brand of misery
From being alone too long
You could die from the cold in the arms of a nightmare
Knowing well your best days are gone
Picking up hookers instead of my pen
I let the words of my years fade away
Old worn out saddles old worn out
Memories with no one and no place to stay

And the man on the radio won't leave me alone

I stood alone in the cold gray dawn

I know I'm wrong and I couldn't see
I let my world slip away from me

Put a cold one in my hand

Don't ya play I'm so lonesome I could cry
'Cause I'll get all balled up inside

'Bout stoned outta my mind

Just as sure as the morning sun comes

Walked in the kitchen and died
And oh what a feeling 
When my soul went through the ceiling
And on up into heaven I did rise
When I got there they did say
""John it happened this ole way,
You slipped upon the floor and hit your head""
And all the angel say just before you passed away
These were the very last words that you said
Please don't bury me down in the cold cold ground
I'd rather have them cut me up and pass me all around
Throw my brain in a hurricane and the blind can have my eyes
And the deaf can take both my ears
If they don't mind the size
Give my stomach to Milwaukee if they run out of beer
Put my socks in a cedar box, 
just get them out of here
Venus De Milo can have my arms,
look out I got your nose
Sell my heart to the junk man and give my love to rose
Please don't bury me down in that cold cold ground
I'd rather have them cut me up and pass me all around
Throw my brain in a hurricane and the blind can have my eyes
And the deaf can take both my ears 
if they don't mind the size
Give my feet to the foot loose ,careless ,fancy free
Give my knees to the needy, 
don't pull that stuff on me
Hand me down my walkin cane, 
it's a sin to tell a lie
Send my mouth way down south and kiss my ass goodbye
Please don't bury me down in the cold cold ground

Throw my brain in a hurricane and the blind can have my eyes

Fancy shoes that dance in time
Oh, the secrets of her dark eyes, they did sing a gypsy rhyme
Yellow clover, entangled blossoms, in a meadow silky green
Where she held me, to her bosom, just a boy of seventeen
I recall a gypsy woman, silver spangles in her eyes
Ivory skin against the moonlight,
and the taste of life's sweet wine
Soft breezes blow from fragrant meadows
Stir the darkness in my mind
Oh, gentle woman you sleep beside me
And little know who haunts my mind
Gypsy lady I hear your laughter,
and it dances in my head
While my tender wife and babies, slumber so-oftly in their beds
I recall a gypsy woman, silver spangles in her eyes
Ivory skin against the moonlight,
and the taste of life's sweet wine

0,Please Come To Boston (ver 2),David Allan Coe,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/david-allan-coe/please-come-to-boston-chords-3839750,"(riff)
Please come to Boston for the springtime
I'm staying here with some friends and they've got lots of room
You can sell your paintings on the sidewalk
By a cafe were I hope to be working soon
Please come to Boston she said
No, baby you come home to me
And she said Hey ramblin' boy, why don't ya settle down?
Boston ain't your kinda town
There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee  (riff)
Please come to Denver, with the snow fall
We'll move up into the mountains so far that we can't be found
And throw ""I love you"" echoes down the canyon
And then lie awake at night til they come back around
Please come to Denver she said
No, you come home to me
And she said Hey ramblin' boy, why don't ya settle down?
Denver ain't your kinda town
There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee  (riff)
Now this drifter's world goes 'round and 'round
And I doubt that it's ever gonna stop,
But of all the dreams I've lost or found
And all that I ain't got
I still need to lean to somebody I can sing to
Please come to L.A. to live forever
A California life alone is just too hard to build
I live in a house that looks out over the ocean
And there's some stars that fell from the sky, livin' up on the hill
Please come to L.A. she just said
No, baby you come home to me
And she said Hey ramblin' boy, why don't ya settle down?
L.A. ain't your kinda town
There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee    (riff)
Please come to Boston
Hey ramblin' boy come home (4x)

1,Longhaired Redneck,David Allan Coe,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/david-allan-coe/longhaired-redneck-chords-64951,"Country DJs knows that I'm an outlaw
They'd never come to see me in this dive
Where bikers stare at cowboys who are laughing at the hippies
Who are praying they'll get out of here alive
The loud mouth in the corner's getting to me
Talking about my earrings and my hair
I guess he ain't read the signs that say I've been to prison
Someone ought to warn him before I knock him off his chair
Cause my long hair just can't cover up my redneck
I've won every fight I've ever fought
Hey, I don't need some turkey telling me that I ain't country
And sayin' I ain't worth the damned old ticket that he bought
Cause I can sing all them songs about Texas
  And I still do all the sad ones that I know
They tell me, I look like Merle Haggard
And sound a lot like David Allan Coe
And the barmaid in the last town that we played in
Knew the words to every song I'd wrote
She said Jimmy Rabbit turned her on to my last album
Just about the time the jukebox broke
Yeah, Johnny Cash helped me get out of prison
Long before Rodriguez stole that goat
I've been the Rhinestone Cowboy for so long I can't remember
And I can do you every song Hank Williams ever wrote
And I can sing all them songs about Texas
  And I still do all the sad ones that I know
I can't help it, I look like Merle Haggard
And I sound a lot like David Allan Coe
But the country DJs all think I'm an outlaw
And they'd never come to see me in this dive
Where bikers stare at cowboys who are laughing at the hippies
Who are praying they'll get out of here alive
The loud mouth in the corner's getting to me
Talking about my earrings and my hair

2,If That Aint Country (ver 3),David Allan Coe,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/david-allan-coe/if-that-aint-country-chords-2118567,"Well I'm just an old man now, was with scars
Most of them I got fightin' in them redneck bars
And a bunch of new tattoos Squench put on me
Why he covered up the ones I got years ago
Back in prison when I was just Dave Coe
And I wasn't famous then, and I wasn't free
Well I grew up in a three room run down shack
At the foot of a mountain by a railroad track
Where decent folk don't go when the sun goes down
Now daddy work the coal mines and he worked on cars
And momma'd go to church and daddy'd go to bars
An most folks just called it the hillbilly part of town
We had a 55 Chevy when I was fifteen
I painted it red but I was still green
S**t I couldn't even afford to buy gas
I had a 410 rifle and a Bowie knife too
Redman tobacco that I liked to chew
And we'd count the car when the train when past
And If That Ain't Country, I'll Kiss Your Ass 
If That Ain't Country, it'll hair lip the pope
If That Ain't Country, it's a damn good joke
I've been on The Grand Ole Opry,
I know Johnny Cash
And If He Ain't Country, What'
Now one of my sisters was a lady of the night
And then one day she saw the light
Now she don't do those things that she used to do
She never made the funeral when daddy died
An I said I'd forgive her but I guess I lied
There's just no way to hide the way I feel
Now me and my brother took our sister Diane 
Down to the funeral home to see the old man
Jimmy was the oldest and Diane was the youngest one
Now Ray was in the middle and there was me
And I'm the one at twenty-three 
Who grew up to be that Yankee's rebel son
Now times are changin' I've heard folks say
It's been ten years since my daddy past away
But I can still picture him in his overalls
Covered with grease from his head to his feet
Cussin' the sweat and the Texas heat, and mesquiters
Standin' by the house where he made his deals
And around the porch was a bunch of old wheels
And a couple Harley Davidson parts daddy sold for gas
There was fifty holes in an old tin roof
Me and my family we was livin' proof
A perfect example of poor white trash
And If That Ain't Country, I'll Kiss Your Ass 
If That Ain't Country, it'll hair lip the pope
If That Ain't Country, it's a damn good joke
Been on The Grand Ole Opry,
And I know Johnny Cash

You act as though your heart is miles away
I speak to you, but you don't even hear me
Don't be unkind: is there something on your mind?
You look at me with eyes that never see me
You're watching memories down in your heart
Is there someone from the past you can't forget, dear?
Don't be unkind: is there something on your mind?
Even though you tried your best to love me
I know I can't compete with memories
So tell me now, before the vows are spoken
While there's still time, is there something on your mind?

I'm sure a dozen questions come to mind

I guess you'll have to blame it on the times
The many times you had your way no matter what the cost
And the many times you took for granted love you now have lost
And if I've hurt you darling  I don't mean to be unkind
I guess you'll have to blame it on the times
That small conceited world of yours  could never understand
That to want to stand alone is not a crime
And if for one time in my life  I'm acting like a man
I guess you'll have to blame it on the times
Blame it on the many times a hiding place I'd seek
Afraid to say what's on my mind and ashamed for being weak
So if at last I'm seeing  after so long being blind
I suppose you'll have to blame it on the times

What my eyes showed me then
The colour in her cheeks
Was just her natural skin
She wore no makeup
To make her look that way
 She was a natural mama with the red cheeks

Well I finally realised
There was hunger in my stare
In my mind I was swayin'
With the woman in the rockin' chair
But the lady I was livin' with
Was standin' right by my side
She saw my stare and she saw my hunger
And Lord it made her cry
So with anger on her face
Yes and the hurt in her eyes
She scratched me and she clawed me
She screamed and she cried
""Oh you don't give me near
All the lovin' that you should
Yet you're ready to go and lay with her

And I guess we could get together
And try this one more time
But I know that wanderlust would come again
She'd only wind up a-cryin'

Plain as the light of day
It's hard to feel guilty for lovin' the ladies

Momma always knew
  When I'd break a promise
She could see it when she looked in my face
And before she went to heaven I promised her I'd change
But my life’s become a shame and disgrace
I know that somewhere there's a heaven
And I know my precious mother is gonna be there
I hope there's a wall around heaven
So momma can't see me down here
I know if she could see me
  How sad her heart would be
Cause I'm worse now than I've ever been before
But momma I'm gonna change
  And I'll live for the Lord
I'll meet you in heaven some sweet day

Build me a home without windows or doors to go in.

With engine oil upon our face

Of what it takes to make it to the top
What makes him want to go well Lord I guess I know
He loves it too damn much to ever stop
He bites the dust once more gets up to hear no score
Then he stumbles to the chutes to ease the pain
And underneath his breath he cusses to himself
I'll ride him if I get the chance again
He's never been a hero and he probably never be one
But in his heart he knows he gave his all
My hat goes off to you my friend and to the champ you might have been
If Lady Luck had smiled on you at all

49,Right Wont Touch A Hand,George Jones,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/george-jones/right-wont-touch-a-hand-chords-1821582,"The wind blows Sunday papers by my feet
As I walk down this cold and lonely street
My hands searched through my pockets for a dime
While the memory of you eats away my mind 
Looking back I see that I was wrong
But the road I'm on don't lead me back to home
And I can't turn back 'cause everything is gone
Yes it's gone
And right won't touch a hand that's filled with wrong
I was filled with so much jealousy
And doubted all the love you had for me
But now I see the kind of fool I've been
I'll never see the one I love again
Looking back I see that I was wrong
But the road I'm on don't lead me back to home
And I can't turn back 'cause everything is gone
Yes it's gone
And right won't touch a hand that's filled with wrong

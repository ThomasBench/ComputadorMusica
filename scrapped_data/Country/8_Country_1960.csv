I watched Mommy and Daddy
And if that's the way it's done,
I don't wanna play house

She don't love me she's just lonesome again
For a while I know that I'll be happy
And that's all that matters within
Though I love her I know I can't hold her
But she'll come back when she's lonesome again

Yes it's true I always have been

A whirlwind is dancing around
I stopped to survey all the beauty that's here
When a shadow moves out across the ground 
It's an eagle that circles above me
And he screams to his friends on the hill
Stay close together move not a feather
Man walks among us be still be still
Man walks among us be still 
Everything hides but I see them
I've spotted an old mother quail
I look close and see looking right back at me
The eyes of a young cottontail
I see a coyote sneaking as he crawls
Through the brush on the hill
And the eagle screams down stay close to the ground
Man walks among us be still be still
Man walks among us be still
Twenty feet high in the side of a Cactus
I see a hole where the Butcher bird stays
If mortals could choose and if Heaven should ask us
Here's where I'd want to spend all of my days
Soon will be gone all the desert
Cities will cover each hill
Today will just be a fond memory
Man walks among us be still be still
Man walks among us be still

Will it be the rain that clings to your bosom
will it be the sunshine that dries your golden hair

none but the wind should warn of your returning

46,Chain Gang,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/chain-gang-chords-2004367,"I was just a kid roaming around
Traveling thru a little old town
A man walked up and said come with me
Your broken son that's vagrancy
A care-free lad that loved to roam but
Lord I wish I'd-a stayed at home
The way it looks I'll probably hang
Cause there ain't no hope on a chain gang
I dig that ditch I chop that corn
I curse the day that I was born
I believe it's better for a man to hang
Than to work like a dog on a chain gang
The guard stands there with a great big gun
I bet he'd love to see me run
And I guess I probably will someday
I'd rather be dead than to live this way
He's well-fed and he's six-foot tall
And he's the meanest of them all
He cracks that whip and he swings that cane
That sun must've touched his brain
I dig that ditch I chop that corn
I curse the day that I was born
I believe it's better for a man to hang
Than to work like a dog on a chain gang
I got a gal back home that's sweet and kind
But she's been waiting a long long time
I just told her to forget my name
I won't ever live down the shame
Lord deliver me from his hole
Before I lose my mind and soul
The flesh gets weak and the back gets broke
There ain't no cause to laugh and joke
I dig that ditch I chop that corn
I curse the day that I was born
I believe it's better for a man to hang
Than to work like a dog on a chain gang

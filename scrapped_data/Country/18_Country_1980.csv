And they seem to be more into laid back songs
Nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
Ev'rybody just wants to go back home
I myself have seen my wilder days
And I have seen my name at the top of the page
But I need to find a friend just to run around
But nobody wants to get high on the town
And all my rowdy friends have settled down
And I think I know what my father meant
When he sang about a lost highway
And ol' George Jones I'm glad to see is finally getting straight
And Waylon's staying home and loving Jessi more these days
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
And all my rowdy friends have settled down
And the hangovers hurt more than they used to
And cornbread and iced tea's took the place of pills and ninety proof
And it seems like none of us do things quite like we used to do
And nobody wants to get high on the town
And all my rowdy friends have settled down
And I think I know what my father meant
When he sang about a lost highway
And Johnny Cash don't act like he did back in '68
And Kris he is a movie star and he's moved off to L.A.
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
And all my rowdy friends have settled down
Yeah me and my rowdy friends done rowdied on down

True love, it's a new love.
They're gonna make it through the hard times,
And walk those lines. 
Yeah, these ties'll bind young love.

She had both hands full, he held open the door,
'Can I help you with these? Can I give you a ride?

Young love, strong love.
True love, it's a new love.

The biggest thing that happens, is the county fair,
I guess that's why it seemed like such a big event,
What we all call the Carroll County accident.
The wreck was on the highway just inside the line,
Walter Browning lost his life, and for a time
It seemed that Mary Ellen Jones would surely die,
But she lived long enough for her to testify.
Walter Browning was a happy married man,
And he wore a golden wedding ring upon his hand,
But it was gone, nobody knew just where it went,
He lost it, in the Carroll County Accident.
Mary Ellen testified that he flagged her down,
Said he was sick, and could she drive him into town,
No one ever doubted what she said was true,
'Cause she was well respected in the county too.
I went down to see the wreck like all the rest,
The bloody seats, the broken glass, the tangled mess,
But I found something no one else had even seen,
Behind the dash in Mary's crumpled up machine.
A little match box circled by a rubber band,
And inside the ring from Walter Browning's hand,
It took awhile to figure out just what it meant,
The truth about the Carroll County accident.
By dark of night I dropped the ring into a well,
And took a sacred oath that I would never tell,
The truth about the Carroll County accident,
Cause the County ordered Dad a marble monument,
I lost him in the Carroll County accident.

Found the bottom of the bottle always dry

He loved to write a song and pick the guitar
And he came to hang a Gold one on the wall.
The town in which he lived is not important
But you'll know which town I mean by the time I'm thru
He soon became a famous entertainer
But leonard was a name he never used
He was on his way to having what he wanted
Just about as close as one could be
Hey! Once he even followed Elvis Presley
And he wrote a lot of country songs for me.
But he laid it all aside to follow Jesus
For years he chose to let his music go
But preaching wasn't really meant for leonard
But how in the hell was leonard s'posed to know.
Well, life began to twist its way around him
And I wondered how he carried such a load
He came back again to try his luck in music
And lost his wife and family on the road.
After that he seemed to bog down even deeper
And I saw what booze and pills could really do
And I wondered if I'd ever see him sober
But I forgot about a Friend that leonard knew.
Well, leonard gave me lots of inspiration
He helped teach me how to write a country song
And he even brought around a bag of groceries
Hey! Back before Muskogee came along.
Really I'm not trying to hide his showname
Or the town in which this episode began
Spoken: [Somehow I had to write a song for old Tommy]
If just to see the smilin' faces in the band.

Who lived just to labor his whole life away

That my body will blacken and turn into coal

and suppose I said ""I wanna come back home"".
And suppose I cried and said ""I think I finally learned my lesson""
and I'm tired a-spendin' all my time alone.
If I told you that I realised you're all I ever wanted
and it's killin' me to be so far away.
Would you tell me that you loved me too and would we cry together?
Or would you simply laugh at me and say:
""I told you so, oh I told you so
I told you some day you come crawling back and asking me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
Now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again"".

And told you that I loved you,
And suppose I said I wanna come back home.
And suppose I cried and said I think I finally learned my lesson
And I'm tired of spending all my time alone.
If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted
And it's killing me to be so far away.
Would you tell me that you loved me too and would we cry together?
Or would you simply laugh at me and say:
I told you so, oh I told you so.
I told you someday you'd come crawling back 
and asking me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go,
And now I found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again.

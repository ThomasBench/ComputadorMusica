0,One Too Many Mornings,Waylon Jennings,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/waylon-jennings/one-too-many-mornings-chords-2360559,"        Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark
        When the night begins to fall then the dogs will lose their bark
        Then the silent night is shattered from the sounds inside my mind
        And i'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind
        From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
        And i turn back to the room where my love and i have laid
        I gaze across the street to the sidewalks and the sign
        And i'm just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind
        It's a restless hungry feeling and it does no one no good
        And everything i'm saying you could say it just as good
        You're right from your side and i'm right from mine
        We're both just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind
        We're just one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind

They're all at the mercy of a good lookin' smooth talkin' man
Lonely women make good lovers
So if you've got a woman, you better treat her just as good as you can.
Lots of times a lonely girl will go out on the town
With no thoughts of evil on her mind.
She don't try to plant bad seeds, but lord knows there's somethin' every woman needs
And a friendly smile will do it every time.
Lonely women make good lovers
Once a woman's tasted love, she can't do without it
She'll search for something warm when she gets cold
And if her lips are wet with wine, when it comes to lovin' time
She'll trade her pride for somethin' warm to hold.
Lonely women make good lovers

My momma didn't bounce me on her knee
My grandma and grandpa‘s done passed on
that kinda left me all alone
My wife took off after our first child,
well my kinda ramblin life wasn't her kinda style
so i kinda got toughened up and my heart learned not to feel
so they started calling the man of steel
And my friends all call me superman
I never let nobody get the upper hand..
o lord i dont know what to do,
the man of steel done got the blues
No woman ever got the best of me
I could walk right out with ease
Until I fell in love and then she walked out
The man of steel got melted down
Now I can't sleep and I can't eat
Can't watch no love scenes on tv
Lord I don’t know what Im going to do
The man of steel’s done got the Blues.
my friends all call me superman

The smell of the night
Sure can get under your skin
Just for a moment  I held you too close
Now I'm all out of time, and I don't wanna let go

Lighting ev'rything in sight,
But tonight no light will shine on me.
Oh, it's shameful and it's sad, I lost the only pal I had,
I just could not be what she wanted me to be.
I will hold my head up high
To that dark and rolling sky,
For tonight no light will shine on me.
I was so mistaken when I thought that she'd be true,
I had no idea what a woman in love would do!
One more night, I will wait for the light
while the wind blows high above the tree.

To get my payday like I done before

44,Dont Toss Us Away (ver 2),Patty Loveless,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/patty-loveless/dont-toss-us-away-chords-3092504,"Well It seems that everyone we've known,
Their love's grown cold will,
Will ours stand as stone,
One by one they break, it's such a shame.
And now you say that you want to do the same,
Don't toss us away so thoughtlessly,
It just ain't right,
Oh can't you see, I still love you,
I want you to stay,
Darling please, don't toss us away,
Well just think of all that we've been through
The world we're building me and you
How could all those years be tossed away
In just one moment in just one day.
Don't toss us away,
It just ain't right,
To let love just die, without a fight,
I still love you,
I want you to stay,
Darling please, don't toss us away,
So now I'm asking once again,
to understand to be my friend,
Oh it hurt so bad to think you'd go
Still the same I love you so,
Don't toss us away so thoughtlessly,
It just ain't right,
Oh can't you see, I still love you,
I want you to stay,
Darling please, don't toss us away,
Darling please, don't toss us away,

And no luck, it's true,
But I always get lucky with you.
I've been turned on, and turned down
When the bars close at two,
But I always get lucky with you.
I keep two strikes against me most all of the time
And when it's down to just a phone call, I'm minus a dime.
I've had good days, and bad days,
But when the day is through
I always get lucky with you
I keep two strikes against me most all of the time
And when it's down to just a phone call, I'm minus a dime.
There's been good days, and bad days,
But when the day is through
I always get lucky with you
Oh, I always get lucky with you.

But life goes on, and this old World will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops falling soft against the window 
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times
I'll get along, you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops falling soft against the window 
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times

When me and my grandpa'd get way 
We'd hop in his pickup truck and we'd go to town 
We had a couple chores that we had to do 
It didn't take long before we were through 
Then we'd let the pickup truck just wander around 
We'd make a run to the county dump 
We'd always wave we saw someone        
Grandpa make up a song as we rolled along 
the post office without fail 
We get some feed and we'd check out the mail 
And we never took the same road twice on the way back home. 
I spent a few years out runnin' free 
I spent two or three in New York City 
moved back to Texas tired, hell I'd had enough 
I'd go to Luckenbach on Saturdays 
Cause Hondo had a way to brighten up my day 
He always made me laugh when we rode in his pickup truck 
We'd make a run to the county dump 
We'd always wave when we saw someone 
Hondo'd make up a tale as we rolled along 
the post office without fail 
He'd get some chew and we'd check out the mail 
And we never took the same road twice on the way back home 
Well I miss grandpa and Hondo too 
I really miss the things that we used to do 
So last week I went out and bought me an old pickup truck 
Now me and the kids spend Saturdays 
We do fun things in a simple way 
We love to start the day with a ride in the pickup truck 
We make a run to the county dump 
We always wave if we see someone 
The kids love to make up a song as we roll along 
To the post office without fail 
We get some stamps and we check out the mail 
Wnd we never take the same road twice on the way back home

And I never thought I'd ever set her free

She said I've loved you for a long time,
But you're married to a friend of mine
And I try hard to never let it show,
But my love for you is stronger, I can't hide it any longer
And so I thought I'd better let you know

The magic   and the wonder
Colors dull and candles dim
And darkness standing under

You send my soul to dreaming
  You've given back my joy in life
And filled me with new meaning

For He lives in my heart and I'll have no fear

All your sins are all now gone this day
Take up your bed and go your way
And as he walked through the crowed they heard him declare
I can tell you all there's a man in there
When the ship was tossed from side to side
And said don't you care that we're about to die
And He said peace be still and when the wind had laid

Shot down and sinkin' fast on Sunset Strip
Holdin' to something in my head
Everything gets heavy when you're losin' your grip
Nothin' looks as empty as a motel bed
Lord I'm still a stranger
In this God-forsaken land
Farther from my future and my friends
I'm gonna take enough to wake me up and make me one last one night stand
Then take me home 'til somethin's gonna smile at me again
Break my connections when I shake me loose
Give my equipment to the band
Let my friend the devil pay the rest of my dues
Take me home 'til somethin's gonna smile at me again

She ain’t lookin’ for a lover, she’s just lookin’ for a home.
If you want more than sympathy then look for something else,
‘Cause she’s not true to anyone not even to herself.
She’ll have sixteen smilin’ strangers who are handin’ her a line,
While she’s drawin’ dirty pictures on the black side of your mind.
With a body she’ll let anybody hold, but the devil’s got her soul.
But if you take her, take her easy,
Treat her gentle, she used to love me.
See the little girl lost, pleadin’ silently for help.
Knowin’ no one understands her, she don’t understand herself.
She’ll feed your hungry ego ‘til you think you’re quite a man,
But you’d better count your fingers when she turns loose of your hand.
‘Cause you’re just a game she’s playin’ any way that she can win,
And you ain’t about to touch her any deeper than her skin,
In that body anybody can control, but the devil’s got her soul.
But if you take her, take her easy,
Treat her gentle, she used to love me.

With diamonds and jewels profound,
Well, I'd rather know that I had salvation,
Than to know my reward,
Would be Satan's jewel crown.
Satan's Jewel Crown,
I've worn it so long but God for my,
Soul has reached down,
His love set me free,
He made me His own, and helped me cast off,
Satan's jewel crown.
Oh, this life that I live so sinful and needless,
Drinking and running around,
All the things that I do for the love of the devil,
I know my reward,
Will be Satan's jewel crown.

I only know I woke to find you gone

Asked his dad to go his bail.

Told his son to go to hell.

Said, ""dad, please take me home.""

She lived ev'ry day to love him,
Nothing else fits in her plans.

He took her life and the stranger's,
Then he took his own.

I bet you never dreamed that old guitar would put me where I am today
Yes, it's been a lot of years, I guess it's been an interesting life
No, ma'am, I never found another woman that I wanted for a wife
I guess the first time showed us that I wasn't the domesticated kind
But I don't blame her for getting tired of living from a suitcase all the time
Yes, I know sometimes it looks like I've just simply thrown my life away
I just always figured that if I hung on, I'd make it big someday
I guess it takes a special breed to live this life and think the way I think
But you'll be glad to hear that any more I ain't near as bad to drink
How is Tommy doing with the business now that Daddy's passed away
I'm sure Daddy always knew that Tom would be the one to take his place
And when he tried to lecture me, I'd sit and pick and sing and let him nag
But way down deep inside I think he always knew that hardware ain't my bag
We open Monday night in Bolton City for another two week stand
I wish there was some way that you and Tom could come and hear my band
Wish I had the time to tell you 'bout the places that I've been, the things I saw

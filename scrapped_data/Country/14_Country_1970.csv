0,Leaving Louisiana In The Broad Daylight,Emmylou Harris,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/emmylou-harris/leaving-louisiana-in-the-broad-daylight-chords-3871016,"Lord, Mary took to runnin' with a travelin' man,
Such a sad case, so broken hearted.
She say: Mama, I got to go, gotta get outta here,
Gotta get out of town, tired of hanging around,
Gotta roll on between the ditches.
It's just an ordinary story 'bout the way things go,
Round and around, nobody knows,
But the highway goes on forever.
Oh, that 'ol highway goes on forever.
Lord, she never would've done it if she hadn't got drunk,
If she hadn't started runnin' with a travelin' man,
If she hadn't started taking those crazy chances.
She say: Daughter, let me tell you 'bout the travelin' kind,
He'll be long gone before you know it.
Oh, he'll be long gone before you know it.
She say never have I known it when it felt so good,
Never have I knew it when I knew I could.
Never have I done it when it looked so right,
Leaving Lou'siana in the broad daylight.
This is down in the swamp where anything goes,
It's alligator bait and the bars don't close,
It's the real thing down in Lou'siana.
Did you ever see a Cajun when he really got mad,
When he really got trouble like a daughter gone bad?
It gets real hot down in Lou'siana.
The stranger better move it or he's gonna get killed,
He's gonna have to get it or a shotgun will,
It ain't no time for lengthy speeches,
There ain't no time for lengthy speeches.
She say never have I known it when it felt so good,
Never have I knew it when I knew I could.
Never have I done it when it looked so right,
Leaving Lou'siana in the broad daylight.
She say never have I known it when it felt so good,
Never have I knew it when I knew I could.
Never have I done it when it looked so right,
Leaving Lou'siana in the broad daylight.
It's just an ordinary story 'bout the way things go,
Round and around nobody knows, but the highway goes on forever.
There ain't no way to stop the water.

We stole a car old Merle And Me
Never thinking we'd be put in jail.
You might say that we were green 
I was barely seventeen
When they put those bars between old Merle And Me.
Late one night we hit the wall
Twenty feet we had to fall
To the ground where we could craw into the weeds.
Waiting for that shotgun blast
Never thinking we could last
We sure had to grow up fast, old Merle And Me.
We were young and crazy then
It was easy to pretend
Acting like we'd never been in reform school.
Looking danger in the eye
Walking with our heads held high
We were not afraid to die, old Merle And Me.
We were living by the gun
Never caring what wed done
Swearing it was all just fun and games you know.
We would die and go to hell
Before we broke our vow to tell
How we escaped that prison cell, old Merle And Me.
How was Merle or Me to know 
We would end up on death row
Waiting for our turn in the electric chair.
Shot down in a grocery store
We got busted at the door
Praying wasn't easy for, old Merle And Me.
We were young and crazy then
It was easy to pretend
Acting like we'd never been in reform school.
Looking danger in the eye
Walking with our heads held high
We were not afraid to die, old Merle And Me.

8,Orphan Of The Road,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/orphan-of-the-road-chords-2728407,"From a carny show and a rodeo that shared a three-day stand
A cowboy met a fiery carny queen
In new spring nights amid the lights of the painted carny van
They laughed and loved and shared short-lived dreams
But the carny show and the rodeo went their separate ways
And the carny season bloomed and soon moved on
And I was born on a winter morn to the dark-eyed carny queen
The too-late son of something that was gone
The black-sheep child that grew up wild from the seed the four winds sowed
Unwanted son of ice and fire, an orphan of the road
I was still a child when my mama died of a chill that closed her eyes
So I was left to grow up on my own
Without a name, too wild to tame. No one cared to try
So mostly I was mostly left alone
In dingy bars and cold boxcars, hobo jungle camps
I joined the men who drift from town to town
The surging flood of restless blood flowed inside my veins
I'd never find the time to settle down
The black sheep child that grew up wild From the seed the four winds sowed
Unwanted son of ice and fire An orphan of the road
In the misty rain, I caught the train that slowed down through the town
And I pulled myself into the boxcar door
In a passing light in the deep gray night, I saw the still dark form
Of an old man lying sick upon the floor
And he said ""I tried to find her, but they told me that she'd died
And that she'd left an only son behind
And I tried to find him, but I never did, but I know I could rest in peace
If I could just see him once before I die
I found a match and I quickly scratched it into a flicker and flame
Then I held it close and I gently raised his head
My mother, sir,"" I said of her, ""I have her same dark eyes
He smiled a cowboy smile and then was dead
The black sheep child that grew up wild From the seed the four winds sowed
Unwanted son of ice and fire An orphan of the road

Why you never see bright colors on my back, and
Why does my ap -  pearance, seem to have a sombre tone,
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on.
I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down,
Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town.
I wear it for the prisoner, who has long paid for his crime.
But is there because he's a victim of the crime.
I wear the black for those, who've never read,
Or listened to the words, that Jesus said,
About the road to happi - ness, through love and chari - ty,
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me.
Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do sup - pose,
In our streak-of-lightnin' cars and fancy clothes,
But just so we're re -minded, of, the ones who are held back,
Up front there oughta be a man in black.           
I wear it for the sick and lonely old,
For the reckless ones, whose bad trip left them cold,
I wear the black in mournin', for the lives that could have been,

And then a little light from heaven filled my soul
He bathed my heart in love and wrote my name above
Just a little talk with Jesus made me whole
He will hear our faintest cry and He will answer by and by
Now when you feel a prayer wheel turning
Then you'll know a little fire is burning
You will find a little talk with Jesus make it right
Sometimes my path seems drear, without a ray of cheer
And then a cloud of doubt may hide the light of day
The mists of sin may rise and hide the starry skies
But just a little talk with Jesus clears the way
He will hear our faintest cry and He will answer by and by
Now when you feel a prayer wheel turning
Then you'll know a little fire is burning
You will find a little talk with Jesus make it right
I may have doubts and fears  my eyes be filled with tears
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and night
I go to Him in prayer  He knows my every care

And gave him all the confidence he lacked,
With a purple heart and a monkey on his back.

Pinballs and pool halls flashing their lights.
Making change behind the counter in a penny arcade
Sat the fat girl daughter of Virginia and Ray
Lydia hid her thoughts like a cat
Behind her small eyes sunk deep in her fat.
She read romance magazines up in her room
And felt just like Sunday on Saturday afternoon.
But dreaming just comes natural
Like the first breath from a baby,
Like sunshine feeding daisies,
Like the love hidden deep in your heart.
Bunk beds, shaved heads, Saturday night,
a warehouse of strangers with sixty watt lights.
Staring through the ceiling, just wanting to be
Lay one of too many, a young PFC.
There were spaces between Donald and whatever he said.
Strangers had forced him to live in his head.
He envisioned the details of romantic scenes
After midnight in the stillness of the barracks latrine.
Hot love, cold love, no love at all.
A portrait of guilt is hung on the wall.
Nothing is wrong, nothing is right.
Donald and Lydia made love that night.
They made love in the mountains, they made love in the streams,
They made love in the valleys, they made love in their dreams.
But when they were finished there was nothing to say,
Cause mostly they made love from ten miles away.

        The silver tongued devil and I
Like all the young maidens who'd laid down beside him
She knew in her heart that he'd lied
But nothing that I could have said could have saved her
No matter how hard that she tried
'Cause she'll offer her charms to the darkness and danger
Of something that she's never known
And open her arms at the smile of a stranger
Who'll love her and leave her alone
        I said hey, little girl, don't you know he's the devil
        He's everything that I ain't
        Hiding intentions of evil,   under the smile of a saint
        All he's good for is getting in trouble
        And shifting his share of the blame
        And Some people swear he's my double
        And some even say we're the same
        But the silver-tongued devil's got nothing to lose
        I'll only live 'till I die
        We take our own chances, pay our own dues  [pause}
        The silver tongued devil and I

48,The Silver Tongued Devil And I (ver 2),Kris Kristofferson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/kris-kristofferson/the-silver-tongued-devil-and-i-chords-2995973,"I took myself down to the Tally Ho Tavern
To buy me a bottle of beer
And I sat me down by a tender young maiden
Who's eyes were as dark as her hair
And as I was searching from bottle to bottle
For something un-foolish to say
That silver tongued devil just slipped from the shadows
And smilingly stole her away
I said: ""Hey, little girl, don't you know he's the devil
""He's everything that I ain't
""Hiding intentions of evil
""Under the smile of a saint
""All he's good for is getting in trouble
""And shiftin' his share of the blame
""And some people swear he's my double
""And some even say we're the same
""But the silver-tongued devil's got nothing to lose
""I'll only live 'til I die
""We take our own chances and pay our own dues {pause}

Like all the fair maidens who've laid down beside him
She knew in her heart that he'd lied
Nothin' that I could have said could have saved her
No matter how hard that she tried
'Cos she'll offer her charms to the darkness and danger
Of somethin' that she's never known
And open her arms at the smile of a stranger
Who'll love her and leave her alone
  And you know, he's the devil
He's everything that I ain't
Hiding intentions of evil
Under the smile of a saint
All he's good for is getting in trouble
And shiftin' his share of the blame
And some people swear he's my double
And some even say we're the same
But the silver-tongued devil's got nothing to lose
I'll only live 'til I die

Someone comes along
And you came to me
It was almost like a song
You were in my arms   
Right where you belong
And we were so in love
It was almost like a song
January through December
We had such a perfect year
Then the flame became a 
Dying ember
All at once you weren’t here
Now my broken heart 
Cries for you each night
And it's almost like a song
But it's much too sad to write
Now my broken heart   
Cries for you each night
And it's almost like a song
But it's much too sad to write
It's too sad to write

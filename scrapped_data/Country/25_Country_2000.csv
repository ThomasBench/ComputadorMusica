You  came along just then
You gave me crazy love and you whispered,
""You got a bottle and nobody that your missin'.""
I wasn't much of a fighter or a lover
You said, ""Don't get excited, but take cover""
We stepped into the light to pictures of each other
Some were in black and white, the others were in color
Colette, I knew the second we met, you'd go to my head
we took a breath and leapt into the atmosphere
and I guess it was something you said, we'll rest when we're dead
now it must seem pretty clear
That I love you.  Yes, I do.
(repeat x8)

1,Diamonds And Gold,Langhorne Slim,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/langhorne-slim/diamonds-and-gold-chords-692735,"You can have all the diamonds
You can have all the gold
But someday you're still gonna get old
You've got to learn to get happy along the way
Take some chances allow yourself to get lost
You're beautiful baby, you're the boss
You've got to learn to get happy along the way
There's no fold to follow
Only stones left unturned
You must play with fire 
In order to get burned
Toss your misery out the door
What are you waitin' for
You've got to learn to get a little happy along the way
It's alright to change your style
It's alright to smile
It's alright to get a little happy along the way
Tough day at the office 
And a worse night at home
Don't wanna talk about it
Just wanna be left alone
There's no joy in living 
When you're giving all and getting none
It's a new beginning 
You thought you've lost but oh, honey, you've won
You can have all the diamonds,
All the gold
Someday we're still gonna get old
We've got to learn to get happy, along the way
Get your hat
Get your coat, babe
Leave your worries on the doorstep
We've got to get a little happy along the way

The doctor gave me thirty days
But I must have had my mama's will
And Gods amazing grace
I guess I'll keep on livin'
Even if this loves to die for
'Cause your bags are packed and I ain't cryin'
To change your mind cause I was born to be
The baby girl without a chance
A victim of circumstance
The one who ought a give up,
but she's just too hard headed
A single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter
I'm a survivor
I don't believe in self pity
It only brings you down
May be the queen of broken hearts
But I don't hide behind the crown
When the deck is stacked against me
I just play a different game
My roots are planted in the past
Who I am is who I want to be
The baby girl without a chance
A victim of circumstance
The one who ought a give up,
but she's just too hard headed
A single mom who works two jobs
Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter

Who loves her kids and never stops
With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter

When you look out in the morning you might see
And a big ole sky above you lookin' back
You may think of me but I'm a little bluer than that.
Where did we go wrong, I wish I knew, it haunts me all the time
Now wherever I go and whatever I do, you're always on my mind.
I can picture you in his arms tonight, as for me it don't feel right
To let us fade like some old photograph
It may work for you but I'm a little bluer than that.

The prettiest thing I'd ever seen in my life.
An' I loved her at first sight.
I found her in Marietta, a town north of Atlanta.
I brought her home to see my folks,
They loved her too.
We were together for a long time,
Thought it would be for all time.
But things change and re-arrange, she had to go.
She left me cryin' in '79, an airline pilot in Caroline.
I was a wreck, can't drive a check:
It broke my heart.
 My first love was an older woman.
There's been many since,
But there'll never be another.
Built in nineteen fifty-five, snowshoe white, overdrive,
I should've never sold her, I'll always love her,
She was mine.
Years went by, teardrops dried;
I got her back, I was surprised.
In '93, a gift to me on Christmas Eve.
We were both older, so I restored her.
Could've sold her, for alot more.
But I will never, she's mine forever,
Until I go.
My first love was an older woman.
There's been many since,
But there'll never be another.
Built in nineteen fifty-five, snowshoe white, overdrive,
I should've never sold her, I'll always love her,

I'll never sell her, she's mine forever,
I love her so.

Bend those strings till the hank comes out

I really used to care about what others thought
And the way they talk
In a crowd
I used to pull away when she would kiss my face 
And touch my hair
She didn't care who saw
She was all over me
And I used to let it get all over me
And now to prove that I love her
I'd crawl on my knees for the whole world to see
Now that she's all over me
The sky is blue
But from where I stand in the middle of this heartache
It sure looks gray
All alone
What I wouldn't give if I could feel
The familiar touch of her love holding me again
She was all over me
And I used to let it get all over me
And now to prove that I love her
I'd crawl on my knees for the whole world to see
Now that she's all over me
She was all over me
And I used to let it get all over me
And now to prove that I love her
I'd crawl on my knees for the whole world to see
Now that she's all over me

He figured she'd gone back to Austin Cause she talked about it all o' the
It was almost a year before she called him up
Three rings and an answering machine is what she got
If you're callin' bout the car, I sold it. If this is Tuesday night, I'm
If you got something to sell, you're wasting your time, I'm not buyin'
If it's anybody else, wait for the tone,
You know what to do. And P.S. If this is Austin, I still love you.
The telephone fell to the counter. She heard but she couldn't believe
What kind of man would hang on that long, What kind of love that must be
She waited three days and then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say but she heard three rings and then:
If it's Friday night, I'm at the ball game, and first thing Saturday, if it
I'm heading out to the lake, and I'll be gone all weekend long.
But I'll call you back when I get home,
on Sunday afternoon. And P.S. If this is Austin, I still love you.
This time she left her number But not another word
Then she waited by the phone and Sunday evening, This is what he heard:
If you're calling about my heart, It's still yours
I should've listened to it a little more,
Then it wouldn't have taken me so long to know where I belong.
And by the way, Boy, this is no machine you're talking to
Can't you tell that this is Austin and by the way,
I still love you.

Grab your bag and grab your coat 
Tell the ones that need to know
We are headed north
One foot in and one foot back
But it don't pay to live like that
So I cut the ties and I jumped the tracks
For never to return
Aw Brooklyn Brooklyn take me in
Are you aware the shape Im in?
My hands they shake my head it spins
Aw Brooklyn Brooklyn take me in
When at first i learned to speak
I used all my words to fight
With him and her and you and me
Aw but its just a waste of time
Yea its such a waste of time
That women she's got eyes that shine
Like a pair of stolen polished dimes 
She asked to dance I said it's fine (aw it's fine)
I'll see you in the morning time
Aw Brooklyn Brooklyn take me in
Are you aware the shape Im in?
My hands they shake my head it spins
Aw Brooklyn Brooklyn take me in
Three words that became hard to say
I and love and you
What you are then I am today
Look at the things I do
Aw Brooklyn Brooklyn take me in
Are you aware the shape Im in?
My hands they shake my head it spins
Aw Brooklyn Brooklyn take me in
Dumb down and numbed by time and age
Your dreams they catch the world the cage
The highway sets the travelers stage
All exits look the same
Three words that became hard to say
I and love and you
I and love and you
I and love and you
She keeps it simple
And I am thankful for her kind of lovin' 
'Cause it's simple 
No longer do we wonder if we're together 
We're way past that 
And I've already asked her 
So in January we're gettin' married 
She's talkin' to me with her voice 
Down so low I barely hear her 
But I know what she's sayin' 
I understand because my heart and hers are the same 
And in January we're gettin' married 
And I was sick with heartache 
And she was sick like Audrey Hepburn when I met her 
But we would both surrender 
True love is not the kind of thing you should turn down 
Don't ever turn it down 
I hope that I don't sound to insane when I say 
There is darkness all around us 
I don't feel weak but I do need sometimes for her to protect me 
And reconnect me to the beauty that I'm missin' 
And in January we're gettin' married 
No longer does it matter what circumstances we were born in 
She knows which birds are singin' 
And the names of the trees where they're performin' in the mornin 
And in January we're gettin' married 
Come January let's get married
Theres a darkness upon me thats flooded in light
In the fine print they tell me whats wrong and whats right
And it comes in black and it comes in white
And Im frightened by those that dont see it
When nothing is owed or deserved or expected
And your life doesnt change by the man thats elected
If youre loved by someone, youre never rejected
Decide what to be and go be it
There was a dream and one day I could see it
Like a bird in a cage I broke in and demanded that somebody free it
And there was a kid with a head full of doubt
So Ill scream til I die and the last of those bad thoughts are finally out
Theres a darkness upon you thats flooded in light
And in the fine print they tell you whats wrong and whats right
And it flies by day and it flies by night
And Im frightened by those that dont see it
Theres a darkness upon me thats flooded in light
In the fine print they tell me whats wrong and whats right
Theres a darkness upon me thats flooded in light
And Im frightened by those that dont see it
There was light in the room
Then you left and it was through
Then the frost started in on my toes and fingertips 
and it spread 
and it spread into my heart 
and it spread 
and it spread into my heart
Then for I don't know how long
I settled in to doing wrong 
and as the wind fills the sail
came the thought to hurt myself
and it spread 
and it spread into my home
and it spread
and it spread into my song
where there are no lines
separating the truth from the lies
Then you came back from space
with a brand new laugh and a different face 
You took my hand and held it up
and shot my arm full of love
and it spread 
and it spread into my home
and it spread
and it spread into my song
where there are no lines
separating the truth from the lies
I wanna have friends that I can trust
That love me for the man I've become not the man I was
I wanna have friends that will let me be
All alone when being alone is all that I need
Will you understand when I am too old of a man?
And will you forget when we have paid our debt
Who did we borrow from? Who did we borrow from?
Okay part two now clear the house
The party's over take the shouting and the people, get out
I have some business and a promise that I have to hold to
I do not care what you assume or what the people told you
Will you understand, when I am too old of a man?
Will you forget when we have paid our debts
Who did we borrow from, who did borrow from?
I wanna have pride like my mother has
And not like the kind in the bible that turns you bad
And I wanna have friends that I can trust
That love me for the man I've become and not the man that I was
The footprints over the snow, the fabric of all the lonely
Covering only the fables and hands
The rest is out in the cold holding the last of the season
F-F-F-freezzin, yeah
My my my hearts like a kick drum
My, my hearts like a kick drum
My, my hearts like a kick drum
My, my loves like a voice
Were walkin in to the fields, were walking into the forest
The moon is before us, up above 
Were holdin hands in the rain, saying words like “I love you”
Cha Cha do you love me? Yeah!
My, my, my hearts like a kick drum
My, my hearts like a kick drum
My, my hearts like a kick drum
My, my loves like a voice
Mother Mary heard us approaching her door
Though we didnt make a sound
Theres nothing like finding gold within the rocks and the coal
I wont look back anymore I left the people that do
Its not the chase that I love, its me following you
My, my, my hearts like a kick drum
My, my hearts like a kick drum
My, my hearts like a kick drum
My, my loves like a voice
My, my hearts like a kick drum
Don't push me out, just a little longer
Stall your mother, disregard your fathers words
Close the laundry door, tiptoe across the floor
  Keep your clothes on, I got all that I can take
  Teach me how to use the love that people say you made
Stop your parents car, I just saw a shooting star
We can wish upon it
but we wont share the wish we made
But i cant keep no secrets
I wish that you would always stay 
Last night I dreamt the whole night long
I woke with a head full of songs
I spent the whole day
I wrote em down but its a shame
Tonight Ill burn the lyrics, cause every chorus was your name
Break this tired old routine
and this time dont make me leave
I am a breathing time machine
Ill take you on for a ride
I am sick with wanting and it's evil and it's daunting
How I let everything I cherish lay to waste
I am lost in greed, this time it's definitely me
I point fingers but there's no one there to blame
A need for something, now let me break it down again
A need for something but not more medicine
I am sick of wanting and it's evil how it's got me
And every day is worse than the one before
The more I have the more I think I'm almost where I need to be
If only I could get a little more
A need for something, now let me break it down again
A need for something but not more medicine
Something has me, oh something has me
Acting like someone I don't wanna be
Something has me, oh something has me
Acting like someone I know isn't me
Ill with want and poisoned by this ugly greed
Temporary is my time, ain't nothing on this world that's mine
Except the will I found to carry on
Free is not your right to chose
It's answering what's asked of you
To give the love you find until it's gone
A need for something, now let me break it down again
A need for something but not more medicine
Something has me, oh something has me
Acting like someone I don't wanna be
Something has me, oh something has me
Acting like someone I know isn't me
Ill with want and poisoned by this ugly greed
Ill with want and poisoned by this ugly greed
Ill with want and poisoned by this ugly greed
You can't be like me
But be happy that you can't
I see pain but I don't feel it I am like the old tin man
I'm as worn as a stone
I keep it steady as I can
I see pain but I don't feel it I am like the old tin man
I miss it
I miss it
Oh, I miss that feeling of feeling
I used to fill the sky around with happiness and joy
I had news to give the wind to keep my sails and heart employed
I felt people move around me
I felt loneliness and shame
Back then every day was different now each moment is the same
I miss it
I miss it
Oh, I miss that feeling of feeling (X2)
The feeling of feeling
The wind upon my face
And caring what it brings this way
The feeling of feeling
The minutes pass away
And caring what I do with them
Maybe bring me love or something else
And so it goes a man grows cold
Some would say a man grows strong
I say the road only grows long
But as long as there's a road
My feet will never touch the ground
And if you won't give my heart back I've no need to stick around
I miss it
I miss it
Oh, I miss that feeling of feeling (X2)
The feeling of feeling
The feeling of feeling
It's hard to tell from where I'm sitting
I guess it's time that I was quitting
A slight figure of speech
I cut my chest wide open
They come and watch us bleed
Is it art like I was hoping now?
I went and cut my hair
I bought us tickets there
A slight figure of speech
I cut my chest wide open
They come and watch us bleed
Is it art like I was hoping now?
I jump over the sea
But that can't catch me, no
A slight figure of speech
I cut my chest wide open
They come and watch us bleed
Is it art like I was hoping now?
I lost my fear in your arms
I lost my tears in your car
I lost my will in your candle lit eyes
And all my love in your yard
Baby would you leave me if you knew that I was making it up?
And underneath the love you got to wonder am I giving you up?
No way am I
It goes on.
Violent is the motion in my heart and in my body and mind.
And silent is the feeling that I lost but I'm determined to find.
And love is but an ocean, unrealistic notion, but I cling to her devotion, 
and I let it pull me down to the floor.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on.
I found my will in your car
I caught my tears in your arms
I found myself on that poor county drive
And found my love in your guard
Baby would you leave me if you knew that I was making it up?
And underneath the love you got to wonder am I giving you up?
No way am I.   
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on.
It goes on, on, on.
I havent finished a thing since I started my life
I dont feel much like starting now.
Walking out lonely has worked like a charm
Im the only one I have to let down.
But watching you makes me think that that is wrong
I can go on with my insecure nature
I can keep living off sympathy.
I can tell all the people that all of my success
Is a direct reflection on me.
But watching you makes me think that that is wrong
What is important? Whats really important?
Am I not to know by my name?
Will I ever know silence without mental violence?
Will the ringing at night go away?
Its up to you.
My father told me.
I havent finished a thing since I started my life

19,You Won,Keith Urban,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/keith-urban/you-won-chords-2306975," There was a world outside my door,
 I wasn't in touch with anymore.
 There was a way I used to feel,
 I knew what was and wasn't real.
 You built a bridge, I tore it down,
 I felt safe on shaky ground.
 And I was a master of despair,
 Making believe I didn't care.
 I shouldn't be standing here today,
After all the crazy things I've done.
 I'm ready to fall and that's OK,
 I ran as far as I could run.
You won.
 Out of a world turned upside down,
 It took some time to come around.
 Out of a dream you made me whole,
 You lit a fire down in my soul.
 I shouldn't be standing here today,
After all the crazy things I've done.
 I'm ready to fall and that's OK,
 I ran as far as I could run.
And you won.
 I shouldn't be standing here today,
After all the crazy things I've done.
 I'm ready to fall and that's OK,
 I ran as far as I could run.
And you won.
You won.
I'm ready to fall.
I thought I knew what I was doing.
 I thought nobody could slow me down,
 I was just a kid, a motherless child,
No-one to watch over me I was runnin' wild.
Free of all responsibility 'til my life,
And my love for myself caught up with me.
 And now I'm, (ready to fall), yes I am...

Lately I've been noticing I say the same things he used to say
And I even find myself acting the very same way
I tap my fingers on the table to the rhythm in my soul
And I jingle the car keys when I'm ready to go
When I look in the mirror he's right there in my eyes
Staring back at me, and I realise
The older I get, the more I can see
How much he loved my mother, and my brother and me
And he did the best that he could
And I only hope when I have my own family
That every day I see
A little more of my father in me
There were times I thought he was being just a little bit hard on me
But now I understand he was making me become the man he knew that I could be
And every-thing he ever did he always did with love
And I'm proud today to say I'm his son
When some-body says I hope I get to meet your dad
I just smile and say, you already have
The older I get, the more I can see
How much he loved my mother, and my brother and me
And he did the best that he could
And I only hope when I have my own family
That every day I see
A little more of my father in me
He's in my eyes, my heart my soul
My hands my pride
And when I feel alone and I think I can't go on
I hear him saying, Son you'll be all riii.......ght
Everything is gonna be all right, yes it is
The older I get, the more I can see
He loved my mother, and my brother and me
And he did, the best that he could
And I only hope when I have my own family
Every day I see, oh I hope I see
I hope every day I see,
A little more of my father in me
A little more of my father in me
I hope every day I see in me
In me, in me
I hope every day I see
A little more of my father in me

that I would like to be dead
in a shark’s mouth
a woman swimming under
her warm breath sending a thunder
onto parts south
And love is stripped and frayed
Duty is delayed
Until next life
Someone has my mind
Holding it so kind
It is my wife
And my home is the sea
My home is the sea
Look not for me
And my home is the sea
Disaster flies upon me
And I scream
And we can see the house lights
Colored from a distance
For a parting is a dream
And tumble into me
My arms enfold these seas
I’m a strong man
And I love my tummy
it’s round and firm and funny
And that’s what I am
And my home is the sea
My home is the sea
I am under your spell
And you will have me, I reckon
And the drowning this town
Is a drowning I welcome
I know nothing and I’m overjoyed
I know nothing and I’m overjoyed
I know nothing and I’m overjoyed
God gave you life and thought
And now it’s ours to waste
I have the finest love
And the finest taste
And with the sea air in my lungs
I am home

when the news of revolution hit the air
The girls hadn't even started taking down our posters
when the boys started cutting off their hair
The radio stations all decided angst was finally 
old enough it ought to have a proper home
Dead fat or rich nobody’s left to bitch
about the goings on in self destructive zones
The night the practice room caught fire
there were rumors of a dragon headed straight for Muscle Shoals
""Stoner tries to save an amplifier""
and it's like the dragon's side of the story is never told
When the dream and the man and the girls hang around long enough
to make you think it's coming true,
it's easier to let it all die a fairy tale,
than admit that something bigger is passing through
The hippies rode a wave putting smiles on faces,
that the devil wouldn’t even put a shoe
Caught between a generation dying from its habits,
and another thinking rock and roll was new
Till the pawn shops were packed like a backstage party,
hanging full of pointy ugly cheap guitars
And the young'uns all turned to karaoke,
hanging all their wishes upon disregarded stars
My Grandaddy's shotgun is locked in a closet
and it never shot a thing that could have lived
An old man decided that you couldn't choose your poison
till you're nearly old enough to vote for him
They turned what was into something so disgusting
even wild dogs would disregard the bones

about the goings on in self destructive zones

Would you come to me and ease my pain?
If you needed me, I would come to you, 
I'd swim the seas for to ease your pain.
In the night’s forlorn ah the morning's born,
And the morning shines with the lights of love.
You will miss sunrise if you close your eyes,
And that would break my heart in two.
The Lady's with me now since I showed her how
To lay her lily hand in mine.
Loop and Lil agree she's a sight to see
And a treasure for the poor to find?
Well if I needed you, would you come to me? 
Would you come to me and ease my pain?
If you needed me, I would come to you, 
I'd swim the seas for to ease your pain.

And put some feel good in my soul
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
Want a little more right and a little less left
And just kick back and let the feelin' flow
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
I set my sails for a new direction
But the wind got in my way
I changed my course but my definition of change
Just ain't the same
I'm gonna sit around here, stay away from there
Or maybe I'll just let her go
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke, yeah (11 10 8 open 8 solo)
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
Drink a little drink, smoke a little smoke
Kick back, give the blues spin
Dig down deep, find my stash
Kick back, give the blues spin

Better maybe break out that old rock and roll

Danced around the broken blues in the dirty summer rain,
Moonlight on the cars parked in single file, the bars,
With their thick and rosy smoke waving its busted hand
Bringin you down, Can't bring you down
Bringin you down, Can't bring you down
Bringin you down, Can't hear the soun
Run through the river and into town
Pretty little moon with it's head on down
Chin Up Cheer Up
Chin Up Cheer Up
Took a walk with you and I busted up my shoe
In an old yellow canoe out in Hollywood
You called the police, but they didn't care, the lease
On your place had run out , your landlord straightened his hat
Bringin you down, Can't bring you down
Bringin you down, Can't bring you down
Bringin you down, Can't hear the soun
Run through the river and into town
Pretty little moon with it's head on down

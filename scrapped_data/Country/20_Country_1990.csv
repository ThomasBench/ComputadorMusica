0,We Shall Be Free,Garth Brooks,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/garth-brooks/we-shall-be-free-chords-930367,"This ain't comin' from no prophet
Just an ordinary man
When I close my eyes I see
The way this world shall be
When we all walk hand in hand
When the last child cries, for a crust of bread
When the last man dies, for just words that he said
When there's shelter over, the poorest head
Then we shall, be free
When the last thing we notice, is the color of skin
And the first thing we look for is the beauty within
When the skies and the oceans are clean again
Then we shall be free
We shall be free
We shall be free
Stand straight, and walk proud
'Cause we shall be free
When we're free to love, anyone we choose
When this world's big enough for all different views
When we all can worship, from our own kind of pew
Then we shall, be free
We shall be free
We shall be free
Stand straight, and walk proud
'Cause we shall be free
And when money talks, for the very last time
And nobody walks, a step behind
And there's only one race, and that's mankind
Then we shall, be free
We shall be free
We shall be free
Stand straight, and walk proud
'Cause we shall be free

1,Standing Outside The Fire (ver 3),Garth Brooks,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/garth-brooks/standing-outside-the-fire-chords-3898259,"WE CALL THEM COOL
THOSE HEARTS THAT HAVE NO SCARS TO SHOW
THE ONES THAT NEVER DO LET GO
AND RISK THE TABLES BEING TURNED
WE CALL THEM FOOLS
WHO HAVE TO DANCE WITHIN THE FLAMES
WHO CHANCE THE SORROW AND THE SHAME
THAT ALWAYS COMES WITH GETTING BURNED
BUT YOU’VE GOT TO BE TOUGH
WHEN CONSUMED BY DESIRE
CAUSE IT’S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO
STAND OUTSIDE THE FIRE
WE CALL THEM STRONG
THOSE WHO CAN FACE THIS WORLD ALONE
WHO SEEM TO GET BY ON THEIR OWN
THOSE WHO WILL NEVER TAKE THE FALL
WE CALL THE WEAK
WHO ARE UNABLE TO RESIST
THE SLIGHTEST CHANCE THAT MIGHT EXIST
AND FOR THAT FORSAKE IT ALL
THEY’RE SO HELLBENT ON GIVING
ON WALKING A WIRE
CONVINCED IT’S NOT LIVING
IF YOU STAND OUTSIDE THE FIRE
STANDING OUTSIDE THE FIRE
STANDING OUTSIDE THE FIRE
LIFE IS NOT TRIED IT IS MERELY SURVIVED
IF YOU’RE STANDING OUTSIDE THE FIRE
THERE’S THIS LOVE THAT IS BURNING
DEEP IN MY SOUL CONSTANTLY YEARNING
TO GET OUT OF CONTROL
WANTING TO GLIDE HIGHER AND HIGHER

    STANDING OUTSIDE THE FIRE

2,Its Your Song,Garth Brooks,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/garth-brooks/its-your-song-chords-1698067,"Standing in the spotlight
On such a perfect night
Knowing that you're out there listening
And I remember one time
When I was so afraid
I didn't think I had the courage
To stand up on this stage
Then you reached into my heart
And you found the melody
And if there ever was somebody
Who made me believe in me
It was you
It was you
It was your song that made me sing
It was your voice that gave me wings
It was your light that shined guiding my heart to find
This place where I belong
It was your song
Every night I pray
Before the music starts to play
That I'll do my best and I won't let you down
And for all the times I've stood here
This feeling feels brand new
And anytime I doubt myself, I think of you...'Cause
It was your song that made me sing
It was your voice that gave me wings
It was your light that shined guiding my heart to find
This place where I belong
It was your song
Dreams can come true
with God's great angels like you
It was your song
It's always been your song

A serious injury and a whole lot of endless pain
If it was a storm   I'd compare it to a hurricane

If it was a drink it would be a strong one
If it was a sad song, it would be a long one
If it was a color, it would be deep deep blue

it would be you

If it was a tidal wave, it would sink a thousand ships,

  Rattled through the reeds and the willow trees beyond  
Daddy in his good hat, momma in her Sunday dress  
Watched with pride as I stood there   
in the water up to my chest  
And the preacher spoke about the cleansing blood  
And I sank my toes into that east Tennessee mud  
Then it was down with the old man,  
 Up with the new  
  Raised to walk in the way of light and truth  
I didn't see no angels  
Just a few saints on the shore  
I felt like a newborn baby  
Cradled up in the arms of the Lord  
Amazing Grace, oh how sweet the sound  
  There was glory in the air,  
there was dinner on the ground  
My sins which were many, were washed away and gone  
Along with a buffalo nickle,  
I forgot to leave at home  
That seemed like such a small small price to pay  
For the blessed peace of mind,  
that came to me that day  
It was down with the old man,  
  Up with the new  
  Raised to walk in the way of light and truth  
  I didn't see no angels  
Just a few saints on the shore  
But I felt like a newborn baby  
Cradled up in the arms of the Lord  
This road is long and dusty  
Sometimes a soul it must me cleansed  
And I long to feel that water  
Rushing over me again  
Down with the old man up with the new  
  Raised to walk in the way of light and truth  
Didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore  
I felt like a newborn baby  
Cradled up in the arms of the Lord  
I felt like a newborn baby  
Cradled up in the arms of the Lord

But, I've got plans for tonight
When I'm feeling blue, know just what to do
And how to make it right
Seems like I've needed this forever
Gonna have myself a night to remember
Dim the lights. Lock the doors
Spread your pictures on the floor
Throw the dust off of our past
Let it all coming flooding back
Cause it ain't easy being strong
And when I can't forget you're gone
I just surrender
Gonna have myself a night to remember
Sad ain't my style but once in a while
I just have to give in
Cause a woman 1ike you, is so hard to 1ose
You just don't want it to end
I know this can't go on forever

Dim the lights. Lock the doors
Spread your pictures on the floor

There's a swing outside on the porch where I feel I could
Rock away the dusk til the dawn
And even though the wind may be howlin'
Stars are bright and they push me on and on
There's a half moon rising in southeastern skies
There's a cold wind blowin' across the great divide
And the stars they guide my way across the night
There's a half moon rising, pushin me on to another mountain top
Push me on, no I'll never stop, push me on home

And my coat is tattered and worn 
And the hunger in my belly, and the fever in my head 
Will vanish 'ere my first glimpse of home
And even though the rain may now be fallin' 
The passion is deep and pushes me on

As she lies sleeping
Down below me now in the valley 
Is the only place on earth that I ever want to know
And her lips are as soft as I remember 
She alone has brought me back on home

Hits me straight in the eye
Guess you forgot to close the blind last night
Oh that's right, I forgot, it was me
I sure do miss the smell of black coffee in the morning,
The sound of water splashing all over the bathroom,
The kiss that you would give me even though I was sleeping,
But I kind of like the feel of this extra few feet in my bed
Telephone's ringing, but I don't answer it
'Cause everybody knows that good news always sleeps till noon
Guess it's tea and toast for breakfast again
Maybe I'll add a little T.V. too
No milk!    God, how I hate that
Guess I'll go to the corner, get breakfast from Jenny
She's got a black eye this morning, ""Jen how'd ya get it?""
She says, ""Last night, Bobby got a little bit out of hand""
Lunchtime, I start to dial your number
Then I remember so I reach for somebodies smoke
And anyways I'd rather listen to Coltrane
Than go through all that shit again
There's something about an afternoon spent doing nothin  
Just listening to records and watching the sun falling
Thinking of things that don't have to add up to something
And this spell won't be broken
By the sound of keys scraping in the lock
Maybe tonight it's a movie  With plenty of room
 for elbows and knees
A bag of popcorn all to myself,
Black and white with a strong female lead
And if I don't like it, no debate, I'll leave
Here comes that feeling that I'd forgotten
How strange these streets feel
when you're alone on them 
Each pair of eyes just filled with suggestion
So I lower my head, make a b-line for home
Seething inside
Funny, I'd never noticed
The sound the streetcars make as they pass my window
Which reminds me that I forgot to close the blind again
Yeah, sure I'll admit there are times when I miss you
Especially like now when I need someone to hold me
But there are some things that can never be forgiven
And I just gotta tell ya
That I kinda like this extra few feet in my bed

California to the sea

I hoed sugar beets outside of Firebaugh
I picked the peaches from the Marysville trees
Me and a hundred others just like me
We split up come the springtime

Shouted my name and disappeared in the rain and wind
They found him shot dead outside of Stockton
His body lyin' on a muddy hill
Somebody killin' just to kill
Late that summer I was rollin' through the plains of Texas
A vision passed before my eyes
A small house sittin' trackside
With the glow of the savior's beautiful light
A woman stood cookin' in the kitchen
Kid sat at a table with his old man
Now I wonder does my son miss me
Does he wonder where I am
Tonight I pick my campsite carefully
Outside the Sacramento yard
In the early winter dark
Wind whistling cold I pull my coat around me
Heat some coffee and stare out into the black night
With my machete by my side
Tonight I'm sorry could not fill
And the name of who I ought to kill

And when I looked I couldn’t believe just what I saw
She said, “I bet you don’t remember me”
And I said, “Only ev’ry other memory”
I had a barbecue stain on my white T-shirt
You were killin' me in that mini-skirt
Skippin’ rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
You had a suntan line and red lipstick
I worked so hard for that first kiss and a
Heart don’t forget something like that
Like an old photograph time can make a feeling fade
But the mem’ry of the first love never fades away
I had a barbecue stain on my white T-shirt

Skippin’ rocks on the river by the railroad tracks
She had a suntan line and red lipstick

No, a heart don’t forget

And if I can make that sacrifice
Honey, you can do it too

Well, you come home drunk and nasty
You won't tell me where you've been

She has feelings that fly by night
She believes in forgiveness

And you can fly beside her
But you gotta go where your heart says go
She lets the bright lights guide her
Through the rain and the drivin' snow
Where she comes from she don't know
She's a child of the wild blue yonder
Flying out of here
She's a child of the wild blue yonder
Born in an angel's wing
If you see her falling
That's just a little trick she does
She makes a dive for the pain that's calling
Then heads for the clouds like a little dove
She can't help her laughing
She can't stop your crying days

To hold on a love that surely must fly away

Spirit father praised her
Through their love she was set free
From a baby kicking and screaming
To a full blood woman dreaming
With the power just to be

I thought it'd last forever 'til the motor blew.
Well, I guess I didn't look close enough,
it's a little bit just like falling in love;
looks don't mean a thing, if the heart ain't true.
It might be a cool ride, smooth lines,
something been custom made out in Hollywood.
But when you get done gazing at the outside,
you better start checking out the inside.
If you want a love built to last, you better look real good
and see what's under the hood.
Sporty little model standing by the door,
so, I took her for a spin on the old dance floor.
Headlights shining bright but nobody home.
Now I need something that's more my speed,
got a whole lotta time to find what I need.
so, I put her in park and headed on off for home.

There's so much to look back on now
Still it feels brand new

Three car garage, her own credit cards
He pulls in late to wake her up      with a kiss goodnight

Buy me a rose, call me from work
   Open a door    for me what would it hurt
Show me you love      me by that look in your eyes
These are the little things    I need the most in my life
Now the days have grown to years of feeling all   alone
She can't help but wonder what she's doin' wrong
Lately she'd try anything     to turn his head
  Would it make a difference if she'd   said
Buy me a rose,   call me from work
Open a door    for me what would it hurt
Show me  you love      me by that look in your eyes
These are the little things    I need the most in my life
And the more that he lives, the less that he tries
To show her the love that he holds inside
And the more that she gives, the more that he sees
This is a story of you      and me

I knew thats probably what you'd think
If I dropped by this time of night
Remember way back when
I promised you I'd drop in
At one of those meeting down at the Y
Well, they started talkin 'bout steps you take
Mistakes you make the hearts you break
And the price you pay 
I almost walked away
You could hear a pen drop when this old man
Stood up and said I'm gonna say it again
Like I do every week 
For those who don't know me
Its the simple things in life
Like the kids at home and a loving wife
That you miss the most, when you lose control
And everything you love starts to disappear
The devil takes your hand and say say no fear
Have another shot, just one more beer    
Yeah, I've been there,          thats why I'm here
This ole boy stood up in the aisle
Said he'd been livin a life of denial
And he cried as he talked about the wasted years
I couldn't believe what i heard
It was my life word for word
And all of a sudden it was clear
Its the simple things in life
Like the kids at home and a loving wife
That you miss the most, when you lose control
And everything you love starts to disappear
The devil takes your hand and say say no fear
Have another shot, just one more beer    
Yeah, I've been there,          thats why I'm here
I know for us it may be too late 
But it would mean the world to me
If you were there when I stand to say

Like the kids at home and a loving wife

And everything you love starts to disappear
The devil takes your hand and say say no fear

gettin' to know the concrete
Lookin for a purpose, from a neon sign.
I would meet you anywhere
The western sun meets the air
I'll hit the road, never lookin' behind.
Can you deny, there's nothin' greater
Nothin' more than travelin' hands of time
St. Genevieve can hold back the water,
but saints don't bother
with a tear-stained eye.
Seein' traces of the
scars that came before
Hitting the pavement,
still askin' for more
when the hours don't move along,
worn-out wood and familiar songs
To hear your voice is not enough,
It’s more than a shame.
Can you deny, there's nothin' greater
Nothin' more than travelin' hands of time
St. Genevieve can hold back the water,
but saints don't bother
with a tear-stained eye.
Like a man said,
rode hard and put away wet
throw away the bad news
and put it to rest
If learning is livin',
and the truth is a state of mind
you'll find it's better
at the end of the line.

  I'll split and I'll be gone

ignore

 I see you sometime maybe
When I can't recall
 How you drove me crazier
 Forget about it
  When forever's over
I won't remember how much I loved you anymore 
 Forget about it
 Put me out of your head
Now that you're free and easy out there on 
the town 
 Forget about it 
when you're lying in bed just wishing
I was there to lay you down

 I see you sometime maybe
When you  will recall
 How you drove me crazier

 Laying by the fireside holding me   tight
 I can't remember when I  felt so right

Don't wink, don't wave  don't try to tease me 
with your smile
 Forget about it

reconcile

As it has so many times before

I can feel my world is crumblin'
And the blues are at my door

On a blue piece of paper
The clouds are movin' in
The beginning of the end is near
I feel your love has faded into darkness
It seems I have no friend
I feel the blues movin' in
Oh it's not the words you wrote that made me sad
And broken-hearted
That's put me in this sad shape I'm in
Between the lines are mixed emotions
And there's teardrops on the paper
You said that's all I'll write today
I'll close for now old friend

On a blue piece of paper

And this hole that I'm sinkin' in
Gets deeper while I'm diggin' to get out

Tell me you still love me

My daddy sang the wonders of old cow town
  Silver haired and he's still there 
Under a sky so warm and fair I tell you friends there's a song in every town.
So sing me one more song 
About old San Antone, 
  Seems like a dream now it was so long ago,
  Jerry Jeff Walker can be just like a coat from the cold,
Well I'ma going home
Well it's Nothing short of the gospel hymns, 
  I guess that's why folks keep writing 'um when I die, I want to go there too
some day I hope to walk along heavens street and I'll still be looking for my taco meat 
And I swear I hear a steel guitar just rising in the air.
I said sing me one more song
About old San Antone,
  Seems like a dream now it was so long ago,
  Ol' Guy Clark he can be just like a coat from the cold,
Well I'ma going home
When the night is real real still, 
  Swear I can hear a whippoorwill
  She knows there's music in the dirt down there
  Hill country rain, is a cleansing thing
And all I have to do is see one sitting in a shallow creek
I got nothing to do
I said sing me one more song 
About old San Antone,
  Seems like a dream now it was so long ago,
  Jerry Jeff Walker can be just like a coat from the cold, 
So sing me one more song about those dusty plains,
  Them honky tonk angels, and their lonely bee hive pain, 
  Wish I stowed away on some fast moving train going home, 
I'ma going home.

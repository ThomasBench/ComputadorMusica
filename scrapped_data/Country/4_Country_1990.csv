0,Tennessee Stud,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/tennessee-stud-chords-15851,"Back about eighteen and twenty-five
I left Tennessee very much alive
I never would've made it through the Arkansas mud
If I hadn't been riding on the Tennessee Stud
Had some trouble with my sweetheart's Pa
One of her brothers was a bad outlaw
I wrote a letter to my Uncle Fudd
And I rode away on the Tennessee Stud
The Tennessee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a horse like Tennessee Stud
Drifted on down into no man's land
Across the river called the Rio Grande
Raced my horse with the Spaniard's foe
'Til I got me a skin full of silver and gold
Me and the gambler, we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee
Pulled our guns and he fell with a thud
And I rode away on a Tennessee Stud
The Tennessee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a horse like Tennessee Stud
I rode right back across Arkansas
I whupped her brother and I whupped her Pa
I found that girl with the golden hair
She was riding on a Tennessee Mare
Pretty little baby on the cabin floor
Little horse colt playing round the door
I loved the girl with the golden hair
And the Tennessee Stud loves the Tennessee Mare
The Tennessee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a horse like Tennessee Stud

Local country station Just a-blarin' on the radio
Pick him up at seven and they're headin' to the rodeo
Mama's on the front porch screamin' out her warning
Girl you'd better get your red head back in bed before the morning
Nine o'clock the show is ending but the fun is just beginning
Grap a bite to eat and then they're headin' to the honky tonk
But loud crowds and line dancing just ain't what they really want
Drive out to the boondocks and park down by the creek
And where it's George Strait 'til real late and dancing cheek to cheek
Ain't going down 'til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough
Going 'round the world in a pickup truck
Ain't going down 'til the sun comes up
Ten 'til twelve is wine and dancing midnight starts the hard romancing
One o'clock that truck is rocking two is comin' still no stopping
Break to check the clock at three they're right on where they wanna be
And four o'clock get up get going Five o'clock that rooster's crowing
Ain't going down 'til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough
Going 'round the world in a pickup truck
Ain't going down 'til the sun comes up
Six o'clock on Saturday her folks don't know he's on his way
The stalls are clean the horses fed they say she's grounded 'til she's dead
And here he comes around the bend slowing down she's jumping in
Hey mom your daughter's gone and there they go again
Ain't going down 'til the sun comes up
Ain't givin' in 'til they get enough
Going 'round the world in a pickup truck
Ain't going down 'til the sun comes up

You never once let on we were falling apart

A pretty war with feelings hid 
She begs me not to miss her
She says forever to light a fuse
We could use a hand full of wheel 
And a day off and a bruised road
However you might feel, tonight is real
When I forget how to talk I sing
Wont you please bring that flash to shine?
And turn my eyes red unless they close when you click
And my face gets sick, stuck like a question unposed
Just climb aboard the tracks of trains arm in my fragile family tree
And watch me floating inches above the people under me
Please beware the quiet front yard
I warned you before there were water skies
I warned you not to drive
Dry your eyes you poor devil
Are there really ones like these?
The ones I dream float like leaves
And freeze to spread skeleton wings
I passed through before I knew you
I believe its just because 
Daddys payday is not enough
Oh I believe its all because 
Daddys payday is not enough
Just climb aboard the tracks of trains arm in my fragile family tree
And watch me floating inches above the people under me

Stories nobody knows

Hank's voice on the radio
Telephone poles trees and wires fly by

Broken down shacks engine parts
Could tell a lie but my heart would know
Listen to the dogs barkin in the yard

Lookin out the window
Little bit of dirt mixed with tears

Voices on the wind
Call me back to the first time
Far away and clear
You can hear the teardrops
Fallin' for the last in love
  If I let you down
  All I can say is I'm sorry
  Now it's all over town
  So I don't want to hear it from you
Please don't look away
It's hard enough to say
This could go on forever
When the night is clear
I can hear the teardrops
Fallin' for the last in love
  Every now and then
  Voices on the wind
  I may love you always and always
  Far away and clear
  You can hear the teardrops
  Fallin' for the last in love
  Callin' for the last in love
  Will we always be the last in love

You could tie me in a thousand knots and just watch me unfold

Silver Eagle, Lonely Road
I was on my way to Mobile
For a big New Year's Eve show
Stopped for just a minute
To see a friend outside of town
My collar up, I found his name
Felt the wind die down
And a drunk man in a cowboy hat
took me by surprise
wearin' shiny boots, a nudie suit
and haunted, haunted eyes
he said, friend its good to see you
its nice to know you care
and the wind picked up and he was gone or was he
ever really there
'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whip-poor-will
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right you'll hear his song,
Smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery
He's always singin' there
I climbed back on that eagle
took one last look around
red tail lights, shadow moves slow across the ground
off somewhere a midnight train
slowly passes by
I can hear that whistle blowin'
I'm so lonesome I could cry
'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whip-poor-will
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right you'll hear his song,
Smell whiskey in the air

The good life he promised ain't what she's living today
But she never complains of the bad times or bad things he's done, Lord
She just talks about the good times they've had and all the good times to
She's a good-hearted woman in love with a good-timin' man
She loves him in spite of his ways that she don't understand
Through teardrops and laughter, they'll pass through this world hand-in-hand,
A good-hearted woman loving her good timing man
Cowboys like smokey ol' pool rooms and clear mountain mornings
Little warm puppies, and children, and girls of the night
Them that don't know him won't like him and them that do sometimes won't know how to take him
He ain't wrong, he's just different but his pride won't let him
Do the things to make you think he's right
Mammas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
Don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
Mammas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
They'll never stay home and they're always alone 
Even with someone they love

Let your hand remember every fret
Fingers touching each shiny string
But you let go of everything

Hang around just to meet you
Some threw roses at your feet
And watch you pass out on the street

Kiss your brow, taste your sweat
Write about your soul, your guts
Criticise you and wish you luck

A derelict in your duct tape shoes
Your orphan clothes and your long dark hair
Looking like you didn't care

Blood spilled out from the hole in your heart
Over the strings of your guitar
The worn down places in the wood
That once had made you feel so good

Drove a hundred thousand miles on my knees
Hauled marbles and rocks and thought twice before
I hauled a Barbie Doll bed for the girl next door
She tried to pay me with a kiss and I began to understand
When I turned sixteen, I saved a few hundred bucks
My first car was a pickup truck
I was cruisin' the town and the first girl I seen
Was Bobbie Jo Gentry, the homecomin' queen
She flagged me down and climbed up in the cab
And said, ""I never knew you were a pickup man""
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill
And I still wouldn't trade it for a Coupe De Ville
I got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made
You know, if it weren't for trucks we wouldn't have tailgates
I met all my wives in traffic jams
There's just somethin' women like about a pickup man
Most Friday nights I can be found
In the bed of my truck on an old chaise lounge
Backed into my spot at the drive-in show
You know a cargo light gives off a romantic glow
I never have to wait in line at the popcorn stand
'Cause there's somethin' women like about a pickup man
You can set my truck on fire and roll it down a hill

I got an eight-foot bed that never has to be made

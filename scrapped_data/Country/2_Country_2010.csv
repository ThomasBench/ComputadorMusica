right smack on top, of Sedona Arabelle
John Ford said won’t you hop on in,
in a stagecoach baby, gonna take you for a spin, oh oh, woah, woah.
Hey, little Hollywood, you’re
gone but you’re not forgot.
You got the cash but your credit’s no good,
you flipped the script and you shot the plot.
I remember, I remember when your neon used to
burn so bright and pink-
 a Saturday night kind of pink.
The black list and its hosts
came down so swift, it drove them to the coast
We’re going to California, but were all out of work
I guess that’s better than a grave and a hearse, oh oh, woah, woah
Hey, little Hollywood, you’re
gone but you’re not forgot.
You got the cash but your credit’s no good,
you flipped the script and you shot the plot.
I remember, I remember when your neon used to
burn so bright and pink-
 a Saturday night kind of pink.
There’ll be devils in their rush
The duct tape makes you hush
Hey there Sedona, let me cut you a deal, I’m a little hung-over and 
I may have to steal your soul, woah, woah.
Hey, little Hollywood, you’re
gone but you’re not forgot
You got the cash but your credit’s no good
You flipped the script and you shot the plot
I remember, I remember when your neon used to
burn so bright and pink, so bright and pink!-
 a Saturday night kind of pink.

When my working day is over, we'll go swim our cares away
Put your toes down in the water, and smile across your face
And tell me that you love me, lovely Lady May
Now I ain't the sharpest chisel that your hands have ever held
But darlin' I could love you well, till the roll is called on high
Ive seen my share of trouble, and I've held my weight in shame
But I am baptized in your name, lovely Lady May
Lord the wind can leave you shiverin' as it waltzes over the leaves
It's been rushing through my timber till your love brought on the spring
Now the mountains all are blushin, and they don't know what to say
Except a good long line of praises for my lovely Lady May
Now I ain't the toughest hickory that your axe has ever fell
But I'm a hickory just as well, I'm a hickory all the same
I came crashing through the forrest as you cut my roots away
And I fell a good long ways, for my lovely Lady May

With your quiet voice and impeccable style
Don't ever let them steal your joy
And your gentle ways, to keep 'em from running wild
Dress you down, and tell you that your place
Is in the middle, when they hate the way you shine
I see you tugging on your shirt
Trying to hide inside of it and hide how much it hurts
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends
And the joke's on them
You get discouraged, don't you, girl?
It's your brother's world for a while longer
We gotta dance with the devil on a river
To beat the stream
Call it living the dream, call it kicking the ladder
They come to kick dirt in your face
To call you weak and then displace you
After carrying your baby on your back across the desert
I saw your eyes behind your hair
And you're looking tired, but you don't look scared
Let 'em laugh while they can
Let 'em spin, let 'em scatter in the wind
I have been to the movies, I've seen how it ends

In this brand new Chevy with a lift kit 
Look a hell lot better with you up in it

You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
She was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker 
We were falling in love in the sweet heart of summer 
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said 
  fire it up let's go get this thing stuck

Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you

I looked at her and she looked at me 
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night 
Cuz it felt so right, her and I, man we felt so right
I put it in park 
and grabbed my guitar 
and strummed a couple chords 
and sang from the heart
Girl you sure got the beat in my chest bumpin' 
  Hell I can't get you out of my head
Baby you a song 
You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise 
Down a back road blowin' stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you

So I'm gonna sit right here,
On the edge of this pier
And watch the sunset disappear
Funny how the good ones go,
Too soon but the good lord knows
The reasons why I guess.
Sometimes the greater plan
Is kinda hard to understand
Right now it don't make sense.
I can't make it all make sense.
So I'm gonna sit right here,
On the edge of this pier
And watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

Well I'll remember you
And all the times that we used to
Sit right here,
On the edge of this pier
And watch the sunset disappear

And how to cast an old zebco and how to work a stick shift
He taught me the bible about all 12 disciples
And he made sure that I know there’s life after this
With pearly gates and streets of gold
He said if I just believe that’s where I’ll go
Lord when I die I wanna live on the outskirts of heaven
Where there’s dirt roads for miles and hay in the fields and fish in the river
Where there’s dogwood trees and honey bees and blue skies and green grass forever
So lord when I die, I wanna live on the outskirts of heaven
Now it says in the King James in the almightys kingdom
He mentions a mansion that he’s built just for me
Now I’d gladly trade it for a farm house with acreage
And a back yard that’s shaded and a squeaky front porch swing
That’s where I wanna hang my wings
When I die I wanna live on the outskirts of heaven
Where there’s dirt roads for miles and hay in the fields and fish in the river
Where there’s dogwood trees and honey bees and blue skies and green grass forever

My hopes and my doubts 
The rings on my fingers
And the keys to my house
With no hard feelings
When the sun hangs low in the west 
And the light in my chest won't be kept 
Held at bay any longer 
When the jealousy fades away
And it's ash and dust for cash and lust 
And it's just hallelujah 
And love in thoughts 
And love in the words 
Love in the songs 
they sing in the church

With so much to have and hold

And it finally lets me free

Will the trade winds take me south 
Through Georgia grain or tropical rain 
Or snow from the heavens?
Will I join with the ocean blue
Or run into the savior true 
And shake hands laughing 
And walk through the night 
Straight to the light 
Holding the love 
I've known in my life 
And no hard feelings
Lord they knows they haven't done 
Much good for anyone 
Kept me afraid and cold
With so much to have and hold

For life and its loveliness

Lord knows we've had a few

I'd like to say that I took the reigns and rode away
No regrets, no left-unsaids, just turn the page

I'm jaded, whoa, I hate it
But somehow the highs outweigh the lows
And I'd do it all again even though we both know
I'd still have to let you go

I tried like hell to tell myself it was all your fault
I held on tight with all my might, I just couldn't hang on

When I'm strung out on leaving
Exalting all my demons

And you'd say you forgive me
And we'd live out some easy, ancient song

Now I'm underneath the rubble

 Maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes on the moving on
Well, If you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes to outrun the storm
But im almost out that door 
And I'm one number away from calling to you
I said I was through, but I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess, girl, I confess
I lied when I said, ""I'm leaving, im not coming back""
 Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
 But everywhere I go I see your face
 In my brain, dial it up, everything I want to say 
But I'm still one number away
 Will you pick up when I call?
Or just forget we loved at all,
We don't have to talk, I just wanna hear your voice
And I'm one number away from calling to you
I said I was through, but I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess, girl, I confess
I lied when I said, ""I'm leaving, Im not coming back""

Puerto Ricans they were playing me salsa in the rain
With open doors and manual locks
In fast food parking lots
I headed West, I was a man on the move
New York had lied to me, I needed the truth
Oh, I need somebody, needed someone I could trust
I don't gamble, but if I did I would bet on us
Like the Dead Sea
You told me I was like the Dead Sea
You'll never sink when you are with me
Oh Lord, like the Dead Sea
Whoa, I'm like the Dead Sea
The finest words you ever said to me
Honey can't you see,
I was born to be, be your Dead Sea
You told me you were good at running away
Domestic life, it never suited you like a suitcase
You left with just the clothes on your back
You took the rest when you took the map
Yes, there are times we live for somebody else
Your father died and you decided to live
It for yourself you felt, you just felt it was time
And I'm glad, cause you with cats, that's just not right

You can't sleep alone and You ain't sleeping with Me

You hate how I live
Go up to come down
I smoke You away and then You drink ‘til You drown

If I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name, I bet there'd still be a spark
From back when I was gasoline and this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think 'bout your name on my 
arm
Baby is it spring or is it summer
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night on your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born In The USA
You relive those glory days from so long ago
When I think about you
I think about 17
I think about my old Jeep
I think about the stars in the sky
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen
Whoah-oh-oh-oh
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night
Springsteen, Springsteen
Oh Springsteen

48,Drink In My Hand (ver 2),Eric Church,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/eric-church/drink-in-my-hand-chords-1090961,"Early Monday morning, 'til Friday at five
Man I work, work, work but I don't climb, climb, climb
Boss man can shove that overtime up his can
All I wanna do is put a drink in my hand
Ya fill it up, I'll throw it down
I got a 40 hour week worth of trouble to drown
No need to complicate it, I'm a simple man
All you gotta do is put a drink in my hand
Yeah, the parking lot is muddy, can't get to the door
I'll take my jacked up drop er' down in 4x4
Chill down a long neck, warm up the band
All you gotta do is put a drink in my hand
Ya fill it up, I'll throw it down
I'm about to tear a new one in this old town
5,4,3,2,1, I'm a rocket man
All you gotta do is put a drink in my hand
Make me want to go ouhhh ouh ouhhh, when you dance like that
You got that little tattoo playing peek-a-boo on your back
Yeah, if you wanna impress me, baby here's my plan
All you gotta do is put a drink in my hand
Ya fill it up, I'll throw it down
When you drive me home, take the long way around
You be my Lois Lane, I'll be your Superman
All you gotta do is put a drink in my hand
My head Monday morning that alarm clock sings
It goes bang, bang, bang, while it ring, ring, rings
Yeah, I'm ready to roll, if you wanna, rock again
All you gotta do is put a drink in my hand
Yeah, fill it up; I'll throw it down
I got a little hungover still hanging around
Yeah, that hair of a dog is howling hey there man
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand
Yeah, that hair of a dog is howling hey there man
All you got to do is put a drink in my hand

49,Hard Times,Tyler Childers,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tyler-childers/hard-times-chords-2084199,"I bought a house
At the mouth of the holler
A ring at the pawn shop
And a crib for the kid
I heard some word
There was work up in Hindman
I'm going tomorrow
And hope that there is
My sweat and my wages
They don't seem to weigh out
I'm gettin' more aches
Than I'm gainin' in gold
Whoever said
You could raise you a family
Just a'workin' your tail off
Knee deep in coal
Well the sign at the church
Says I'll reap what I'm sowin'
But I ain't lost sleep
It'll come in due time
If the Lord wants to take me
I'm here for the taking
Cause hell's probably better
Than tryin' to get by
You can see me on front page
It'll be out tomorrow
A boy in his twenties
Shot down in his prime
For trying to hold up
A Texaco station
They'll say I was despereate
They're probably right
I bought a house
At the mouth of the holler
A ring at the pawn shop
And a crib for the kid
I heard some word
There was work up in Hindman
I'm going tomorrow
And hope that there is

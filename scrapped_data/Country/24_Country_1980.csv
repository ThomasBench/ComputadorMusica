0,You Are Always There For Me,Reba McEntire,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/reba-mcentire/you-are-always-there-for-me-chords-1810413,"I know sometimes I'm like a child
I disappoint you so
And how you keep forgiving me
I'll never, never know
When I stumble and I fall
And need love desperately
You are always there for me
Like an oak in the wind
Like an old familiar friend
Like a harbour in a wild and raging sea
Darling, you are always there for me
When I take your love for granted
Like I often do
It's not that I don't need you so
It's not, I don't love you
It's just that I'm a fool sometimes
Just too blind to see
That you are always there for me
Like an oak in the wind
Like an old familiar friend
Like a harbour in a wild and raging sea
Darling, you are always there for me
Like an oak in the wind
Like an old familiar friend
Like a harbour in a wild and raging sea
Darling, you are always there for me

1,Every Second Someone Breaks A Heart,Reba McEntire,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/reba-mcentire/every-second-someone-breaks-a-heart-chords-1810531,"It's a dangerous world we live in
Crime is everywhere
There's always some sad story going down
You can see it on the air
It's an evil epidemic going 'round
But nobody seems to notice
The saddest crime of all
Oh, just how many times a day
Someone takes their love away
And the national statistics
Never put it in the chart
But every second someone breaks a heart
There's a woman out there somewhere
Who feels she lost her life
But her man just shot her world down and it hurts
And it cuts him like a knife
Some girl stole his heart and left him without a world
They don't call it a crime of passion
But it kills you all the same
It's murder when a true love dies
Right before your very eyes
And as soon as one is over
Another one will start
Every second someone breaks, someone breaks a heart
Be careful all the time
Do you know where your love is tonight (if you love somebody)
To find the perfect crime
And you never know just when they'll strike
So you better watch your woman
And you better watch your man
'Cause no one's safe when love's at stake
Anybody's heart can break
And the next time that it happens
You're not the losing part
Every second someone breaks a heart
Every second someone breaks a heart
Every second someone breaks a heart

Isn't that how love's supposed to be
Now it seems the good times are all over

Why I fell in love so easily
And then woke up to find that all he left behind
Were tattered dreams and broken pieces in my memory____

What's so good about watching good love die

Tell me what's so good about goodbye

But no one there to hold

With loving arms that you can lean upon

Got a big long cigar too

Between the two they lived their lives trapped on a dead end street

And if time allowed they'd make those fools wish they were never born

Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Hiding Christmas presents wrapped in pretty bows
Each year they'd be some place I couldn't find

Shaped like Christmas trees
She'd tell me the old old story one more time

we would never look to heaven, make a wish or climb a mountain,

But life ain't no easy freeway, just some gravel on the ground.
You pay for every mile you go to spread some dust around.
But we all have destinations, and the dust will settle down,
this life ain't no easy freeway, just some gravel on the ground.
So let's walk the road together, who knows what we'll find tomorrow.
Maybe good times, maybe sorrow will be waiting round the bend
Given time, two hearts discover what they're feeling for each other.
At the best we'll end up lovers, at the least we'll make a friend.
But life ain't no easy freeway, just some gravel on the ground.
You pay for every mile you go to spread some dust around.
But we all have destinations, and the dust will settle down,
But life ain't no easy freeway, just some gravel on the ground.

Broken lives and families that love has split apart
Children who miss daddy, mommy's on the run
The pleasure that is painful and hidden from the sun
Nashville hearts are lonely words that speak of love gone wrong
Sad and soulful stories and beautiful love songs
For each and every melody of happiness denied
You know that there's another one that shows the other side
Country love is kisses in the kitchen
Country love is honest and its true
Country love is home with your family
County love's the way that I love you
Country love is silky nights and warm familiar hands
Someone whos been there before and always understands
Nashville nights are lonely roads that we've all travelled on
Sometimes they take you far away or they can bring you home
If you're lost out on the highway, do not deny the dove
When Nashville nights the question, the answers country love
Country love is kisses in the kitchen
Country love is honest and its true
Country love is home with your family

For every bit of pain you've caused me
A - nother little tear falls down
Baby, if you hurt me one more time
Oh, I think I'm gonna drown.
 |     |     |   |
So many times, oh, you know
 I've tried to leave you
You say you've changed, foolish me
 I always be - lieve you.
Baby, but then you hurt me a - gain
And there's not a thing I can do
I'm sinking I know but I need you so
I guess I'll go down loving you.
‘Cause I’m standing in a sea of teardrops
It's getting deeper all the time
Standing in a sea of teardrops
And every day I feel it rise.
For every bit of pain you've caused me
A - nother little tear falls down
Baby, if you hurt me one more time
Oh, I think I'm gonna drown.
Baby, if you hurt me one more time
Oh, I think I'm gonna drown.

47,If She Just Helps Me Get Over You,Don Williams,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/don-williams/if-she-just-helps-me-get-over-you-chords-3723806,"It may not make me tremble the soft touch of her hand
But she won't break my heart the way you do
So I'm gonna try to give her the best love that I can
If she just helps me get over you
If she’d just pick me up when I get down
If she's there when the memories walk around
Maybe some day I'll love her as much as I love you
If she just helps me get over you
I don't suppose that loving will ever be the same
But she wants me the way I wanted you
So I'm gonna try to give her the best love that I can
If she just helps me get over you
If she’d just pick me up when I get down
If she's there when the memories walk around
Maybe some day I'll love her as much as I love you
If she just helps me get over you
If she’d just pick me up when I get down
If she's there when the memories walk around
Maybe some day I'll love her as much as I love you
If she just helps me get over you

48,Wouldnt It Be Great,Loretta Lynn,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/loretta-lynn/wouldnt-it-be-great-chords-3761663,"Wouldn't it be fine if you could say
You love me just one time
With a sober mind
Wouldn't that be fine
Now wouldn't that be fine
If you could love me first
And let the bottle wait
Now wouldn't that be great
Wouldn't that be great
Wouldn't it be great hey hey wouldn't that be great
Throw the old glass crutch away and watch it break
Wouldn't it be great hey hey wouldn't that be great
Lord it's for our sake now wouldn't that be great
In the name of love
What's a man so great
Keep thinking of
In the name of love
What a man he was
Love went to waste
When the sexy lace
Couldn't turn his face
The bottle took my place
Love went to waste
Wouldn't it be great hey hey wouldn't that be great
Throw the old glass crutch away and watch it break
Wouldn't it be great hey hey wouldn't that be great
Lord it's for our sake now wouldn't that be great
And I know you could
If you just would
Wouldn't that be good
Lord I know you could
Wouldn't it be great hey hey wouldn't that be great
Throw the old glass crutch away and watch it break
Wouldn't it be great hey hey wouldn't that be great
Lord it's for our sake now wouldn't that be great
Now wouldn't that be great

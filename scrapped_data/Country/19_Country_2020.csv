I been goin' nowhere since I've been gone
How'd I end up here where I don't belong?
I wanna be home   in my own   hometown
Yeah, back where my roots ran wild in my barefoot stompin' ground
Yeah, I wanna wake up to some of that cookin'
Know my way around without lookin'
Home    in my own home  town
I'm always gonna be home-town, yeah
I'm always gonna be home-town, yeah
These black dirt boots just don't fit in
Where the air is thick and they smile too thin
Ain't no wildflowers blowin' here in the wind
And these black dirt boots just don't fit in
I wanna be home   in my own   hometown

I'm always gonna be home-town, yeah
I'm always gonna be home-town, yeah
There's a graveyard there where my granddad is
And a speed of life that I sure do miss
And that high school crush that I never did kiss
I wanna be home   in my own   hometown
I wanna be home   in my own   hometown

Can't hold on to a memory

Things you did and didn't say

The first time I slept on the couch, was our first New Year's Eve
I heard words come out my mouth, that I still can't believe
Broken hearts and shattered champagne
We both don't wanna feel that again
The second I apologized, you said, ""Boy, I don't know""
I said it 'cause I meant, but you still wouldn't let it go
So I swallow my pride, see it from your side
I promise I'll do the best I can do
I won't say I'm sorry over and over
Can't just say I'm sorry, I've gotta show you
I won't do it again, I'll prove my love is true
I hope the last time I said sorry
Is the last time I'll say sorry to you
No, oh, oh-oh (Oh)
No, oh, oh-oh
To you
No, oh, oh-oh
No, oh, oh-oh
The last time I said sorry
Is the last time I'll say sorry
If I could build a perfect world I'd only make you smile
I'd hang the stars, the sun and moon outside this room, but I'll
I'll never be perfect, though I'm gonna try
Oh, I'm gonna do better, I swear that I
I won't say I'm sorry over and over
Can't just say I'm sorry, I've gotta show you
I won't do it again, I'll prove my love is true

14,Murder Most Foul,Bob Dylan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bob-dylan/murder-most-foul-chords-3051382,"It was a dark day in Dallas, November '63
A day that will live on in infamy
President Kennedy was a-ridin' high
Good day to be livin' and a good day to die
Being led to the slaughter like a sacrificial lamb
He said, ""Wait a minute, boys, you know who I am?""
 ""Of course we do, we know who you are!""
 Then they blew off his head while he was still in the car
 Shot down like a dog in broad daylight
 Was a matter of timing and the timing was right
 You got unpaid debts, we've come to collect
We're gonna kill you with hatred, without any respect
 We'll mock you and shock you and we'll put it in your face
 We've already got someone here to take your place
 The day they blew out the brains of the king
 Thousands were watching, no one saw a thing
 It happened so quickly, so quick, by surprise
 Right there in front of everyone's eyes
 Greatest magic trick ever under the sun
 Perfectly executed, skillfully done
 Wolfman, oh wolfman, oh wolfman howl
 Rub-a-dub-dub, it's a murder most foul
 Hush, little children, you'll understand
 The Beatles are comin', they're gonna hold your hand
 Slide down the banister, go get your coat
 Ferry 'cross the Mersey and go for the throat
 There's three bums comin' all dressed in rags
 Pick up the pieces and lower the flags
 I'm goin' to Woodstock, it's the Aquarian Age
 Then I'll go to Altamont and sit near the stage
 Put your head out the window, let the good times roll
 There's a party going on behind the Grassy Knoll
 Stack up the bricks, pour the cement
 Don't say Dallas don't love you, Mr. President
 Put your foot in the tank and then step on the gas
 Try to make it to the triple underpass
 Blackface singer, whiteface clown
 Better not show your faces after the sun goes down
 Up in the red light district, they've got cop on the beat
 Living in a nightmare on Elm Street
When you're down on Deep Ellum, put your money in your shoe
 Don't ask what your country can do for you
 Cash on the barrel head, money to burn
 Dealey Plaza, make a left-hand turn
I'm going down to the crossroads, gonna flag a ride
The place where faith, hope, and charity lie
 Shoot him while he runs, boy, shoot him while you can
 See if you can shoot the invisible man
 Goodbye, Charlie! Goodbye, Uncle Sam!
 Frankly, Miss Scarlett, I don't give a damn
 What is the truth, and where did it go?
 Ask Oswald and Ruby, they oughta know
 ""Shut your mouth,"" said a wise old owl
Business is business, and it's a murder most foul
 Tommy, can you hear me? I'm the Acid Queen
 I'm riding in a long, black Lincoln limousine
 Ridin' in the backseat next to my wife
Headed straight on in to the afterlife
 I'm leaning to the left, I got my head in her lap
 Hold on, I've been led into some kind of a trap
Where we ask no quarter, and no quarter do we give
We're right down the street, from the street where you live
They mutilated his body and they took out his brain
What more could they do? They piled on the pain
But his soul was not there where it was supposed to be at
For the last fifty years they've been searchin' for that
 Freedom, oh freedom, freedom over me
 I hate to tell you, mister, but only dead men are free
Send me some lovin', then tell me no lie
 Throw the gun in the gutter and walk on by
 Wake up, little Susie, let's go for a drive
Cross the Trinity River, let's keep hope alive
 Turn the radio on, don't touch the dials
 Parkland hospital, only six more miles
 You got me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, you filled me with lead
 That magic bullet of yours has gone to my head
 I'm just a patsy like Patsy Cline
 Never shot anyone from in front or behind
 I've blood in my eye, got blood in my ear
 I'm never gonna make it to the new frontier
 Zapruder's film I seen (right?) before
 Seen it thirty-three times, maybe more
 Ugliest thing that you ever have seen
 They killed him once and they killed him twice
 Killed him like a human sacrifice
 The day that they killed him, someone said to me, ""Son
 The age of the Antichrist has just only begun""
 Air Force One comin' in through the gate
 Johnson sworn in at 2:38
 Let me know when you decide to throw in the towel
 It is what it is, and it's murder most foul
What's new, pussycat? What'd I say?
I said the soul of a nation been torn away
And it's beginning to go into a slow decay
And that it's thirty-six hours past Judgment Day

Tell them, ""We're waiting, keep coming,"" we'll get them as well

And stay off the pills

And pay all your bills

Have a good cry
Well, go on and make a good living, girl, don't forget

They'll drive you crazy like a run in your hose

That the prize is looking back and knowing it was all time well spent
Paris in the spring, in 1973
She said if there is a Heaven, well, that's right where I'll be
We said our goodbyes
She gave me a wink and grabbed her coat to leave

I know he's empty
When he fills another drink
It's a temporary fix, but it ain't fixin' anything
Would you take that red wine, turn it into words in red
Let them land there on his lips, let them go straight to his head
Lord, pour water in his wine glass
Bring the man he used to be back
'Cause I wanna look him in the eyes
And see someone I recognize
I'm on my knees, and all I ask
Is, Lord, pour water in his wine glass
No, I don't hate him for it
I just hate that pourin' it out
Gets him out of bed
And puts him right back in it
Lord, pour water in his wine glass
Bring the man he used to be back
'Cause I wanna look him in the eyes
And see someone I recognize
I'm on my knees, and all I ask
Is, Lord, pour water in his wine glass
I know he's broken
Maybe he just needs a break
And his heart is out here tryin', I keep almost losin' faith

I know I’ve been M-I-A
The dreams I just had to chase
Been runnin' me around
The other day it hit me like a hammer
That you can’t get back those moments that really matter
Another candle on a cake
Another month on a page
You blink, another year under the sun we all go 'round

It's knowing that it's flying away
And there's no way to slow it down
Instead of counting up the days
I just wanna make 'em count
I need to catch up with my sister
Our old jacket pins and stickers
Sometimes the bigger picture is in the little things
Hiding out in aisle three
In the CVS from that gossip queen
Who'da told the whole town if she’d seen us acting fifteen, again
The other day it hit me like a hammer

Living by the water somewhere in the Americas
 South or Central, or some Virigin Island
Barefoot and sun kissed, always smiling
 Guys named captain aren't haters, they're lovers
Living life large or largely undercover
Dive bars and cocktails, waitresses and tall tales
Chasing the sun, run aground or full sail, like
 Captain Outrageous and Captain Tony
A painter and a sailor, old Key West cronies
Floating on the breeze, the salt of the sea
Ornery, tattoed and laughing
Guys named Captain
 Casanovas and entrepreneurs
Full of bravado, that's half the allure
The wink of the eye, a shadowy past
Laugh lines from blowing smoke up your glass
Like Captain Bligh and Captain Kidd
Mutiny on the Bounty, first light in the morning
 Buccaneers with nothing to fear
Who go down with the ship, last man standing
Guys named Captain
 Guys named captain have sons and daughters
 Flesh and blood, like my father
 Captain Vic who played the mandolin

  Lookin' up at the blue skies
   Really made me realize
They don't make 'em quite like you
Cinnamon skin in the sunshine
   Stop time in the moonlight
   Really made me feel like
   Like I could fall for you
Then one day you were just gone
And I've been wonderin' for so long
Oh, was it your heart or mine?
Was it just the wrong time, 
Gabrielle?
We never got very far
But, girl, wherever you are
I wish you well
Gabrielle
You were   pickin' flowers on a side road
  Leanin' back on a fence post
  Couldn't help but notice
  You were wantin' somethin' more
I was  starin' off in the distance
  Blinked twice and I missed it
  Can we just rewind it
Like it was before?
And I woke up and you were gone
And I've been wonderin' for so long
Oh, was it your heart or mine?
Was it just the wrong time, 
Gabrielle?
We never got very far
But, girl, wherever you are
I wish you well, oh
Gabrielle
mmmm, oh
And the miles, they fly by
Until you land back home again
And do you ever wonder
What we might have been?
  I can still see ya standin' there
Sun shinin' behind your dress
   Your silhouette
Mmh, so perfect
Take me back there
Take me back there
Oh, was it your heart or mine?
Was it just the wrong time, 
Gabrielle?
We never got very far

I'd rather stay home 'cause when I go out
I wish I never did
Take me back home, when I was a kid
Sobriety is a hell of a drug
They say you only fight with the people you love
But I won't forget what it's like to be poor
I could be there again, baby that's for sure
Love me, hate me
Desecrate me
Call me a bitch
Then call me baby
You don't know me
You don't own me
Yeah that's no way
To stone me
Yeah that's no way
To stone me
You can pick a side but both are wrong
You can fight the good fight but you're on your own
I used to feel loved, now I feel used
Almost went broke just from paying dues
Through the mud and rain you can drag my name
You can say I've spent my life in vain
But I won't be ashamed of what I am
For your judgement day I don't give a damn
Love me, hate me
Desecrate me
Call me a bitch
Then call me baby
You don't know me
You don't own me

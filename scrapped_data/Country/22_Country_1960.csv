Oh, devil woman, devil woman let go of me.
Devil woman, let me be, and leave me alone, I wanna go home.
Running along by the seashore, running as fast as I can.
Even the seagulls are happy, glad I'm coming home again.
Never again will I ever, cause another tear to fall..

35,Gypsy Joe And Me,Dolly Parton,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/dolly-parton/gypsy-joe-and-me-chords-4117252,"explanation?).
We might have slept in a rail yard or camped by the river bank,
we fed ourselves from the fruit of the land
and quenched our thirst with rain.
We never did allow no roots to grow beneath our feet,
life just had no pattern for Gypsy Joe and me.
All we had was each other and the rags upon our back,
the closest thing to a home we knew was some abandoned shack.
But we had all we wanted and the rest we didn't need,
life was free and simple for Gypsy Joe and me.
Now, Gypsy was my little dog, I found by the road in a ditch,
and so I named him Gypsy, 'cause that name just seemed to fit.
Oh, and Joe he was my man, the flower of my soul,
though he never said he loved me, I just always seemed to know.
While standing by the highway, thumbin' for a ride,
the speeding wheels of a passing car,   took Gypsy's life.
I lost him where I found him and his loss was misery,
now there's no more Gypsy, there's just Joe and me.
Well, the winter came and the snow did fall and the night was cold and still
and the rags we wore were not enough and Joe he caught the chill.
And he told me how he loved me and in my arms he went to sleep,
now there's no more Gypsy, no more Joe, there's just me.
While standin' here on the edge of this bridge, lookin' down, I see
the face of Joe and Gypsy, lookin' back at me.
And somewhere in the distance I can hear them callin' me,
Tonight we'll be together again, Gypsy, Joe and   me.
Tonight we'll be together again, Gypsy, Joe and me.

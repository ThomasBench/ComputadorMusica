0,Take Me Home Country Roads (ver 5),John Denver,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-denver/take-me-home-country-roads-chords-1101747," Almost Heaven; West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River.
 Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains,
Blowin' like a breeze.
Country Roads, take me home, to the place, I belong,
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
 All my memories gather round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue water.
 Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine,
Teardrop in my eye.
Country Roads, take me home, to the place, I belong,
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
   I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me,
The radio reminds me of my home far away.
And driving down the road I get a feeling
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday.
Country Roads, take me home, to the place, I belong,
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
Country Roads, take me home, to the place, I belong,
West Virginia, mountain mama, take me home, country roads.
Take me home, down country roads; take me home, down country roads

I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness
'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.
He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.
And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice.""
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow. 
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.
Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
know when to walk away and know when to run.
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.
Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep.
'Cause ev'ry hand's a winner and ev'ry hand's a loser,
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.""
And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
know when to walk away and know when to run.
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
A-plowing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the Riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry
Yippie yi Ohhhhh
Yippie yi yaaaaay
Ghost Riders in the sky
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on hear their cry
As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from Hell a-riding on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the Devil's herd, across these endless skies

Coming home to a place he'd never been before
He left yesterday behind him,
you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door
When he first came to the mountains, his life was far away;
On the road and hanging by a song
But the string's already broken, and he doesn't really care;
It keeps changing fast, and it don't last for long
But the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lul la by 
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below;
he saw everything as far as you can see
And they say that he got crazy once,
and he tried to touch the sun;
And he lost a friend but kept the memory
Now he walks in quiet solitude, the forests and the streams;
seeking grace in every step he takes 
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand;
the serenity of a clear blue mountain lake
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
talk to God and listen to the casual re ply
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado
Now his life is full of wonder,
but his heart still knows some fear;
of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down,
To bring in a couple more;
more people, more scars upon the land
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
I know he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eag le fly
Rocky Mountain high
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high
I've seen it raining fire in the sky
Friends around the campfire and every body's high

Lonestar belt buckles and old faded Levi's and each night begins a new day
If you don't understand him and he don't die young
He'll probably just ride away
Mammas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
Don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
Mammas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
They'll never stay home and they're always alone
Even with someone they love
Cowboys like smokey ol' pool rooms and clear mountain mornings
Little warm puppies, and children, and girls of the night
Them that don't know him won't like him and them that do sometimes won't know how to take him
He ain't wrong, he's just different but his pride won't let him
Do the things to make you think he's right
Mammas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
Don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
Mammas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
They'll never stay home and they're always alone
Even with someone they love

14,Sunday Morning Coming Down (ver 5),Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/sunday-morning-coming-down-chords-1176331,"Well I woke up Sunday morning
with no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
and the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
so I had one more for des-sert
then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes 
and found my cleanest, dirty shirt
then I washed my face, and combed my hair 
and stumbled down the stairs to meet the day
I'd smoked my mind the night before 
with cigarettes and songs I'd been picking
but I lit my first and watched a small kid   playing
with the can that he was kicking
then I walked across the street
and caught the Sunday smell of someone's frying chicken
and lord it took me back to some-thin that I lost somewhere
somehow along the way
on a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing lord, that I was stoned
cause there's something in a Sunday
that makes the body feel alone
and there's nothing short of dying
that's half as lonesome as the sound
of the sleeping city sidewalks
and Sunday morning coming down
in the park I saw a daddy
with a laughing little girl that he was swinging
and listened to the songs that they were singing
then I headed down the street 
and somewhere far away a lonely bell was ring - ing
and it echoed through the canyons
like our disappearing dreams of yester - day
on a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing lord, that I was stoned
cause there's something in a Sunday
that makes the body feel alone
and there's nothing short of dying
that's half as lonesome as the sound
of the sleeping city sidewalks
and Sunday morning coming down

Is gonna keep you free and clean
Now you wear your skin like iron
Your breath as hard as kerosene
Weren't your mama's only boy
But her favorite one it seems
She began to cry when you said good  - bye
And sank into your dreams
Pancho was a bandit, boys, his
horse was fast as polished steel
He wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
Pancho met his match you know on the
borders down in Mexico
Nobody heard his dying words
but that's the way it goes
All the Federales say
they could have had him any day
They only let him slip a  -  way
out of kindness I suppose
Lefty he can't sing the blues
all night long like he used to
The dust that Pancho bit down south
ended up in Lefty's mouth
The day they laid poor Pancho low
Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to   go
there ain't nobody knows
All the Federales say
they could have had him any day
They only let him slip a  -  way
out of kindness I suppose
Poets tell how Pancho fell and
Lefty's living in a cheap hotel
The desert's quiet and Cleveland's cold,
And so the story ends we're told
Pancho needs your prayers it's true but
save a few for Lefty too
He only did what he had to   do
and now he's growing old
All the Federales say
they could have had him any day
We only let him slip a  -  way
out of kindness I suppose
A few gray Federales say
could have had him any day
We only only let him go so long
out of of kindness I suppose

They were praying for the lovers   In the valley of the gun

She said Father please forgive me  I can't make it without my man
And she knew the gun was empty  And she knew she could not win
But her final prayer was answered  When the rifles fired again
They were praying for the lovers   In the valley of the gun
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared  There was thunder from the throne
And seven Spanish angels  Took another angel home
They came and found the lovers as they lay there side by side
Their dreams had all been shattered they said she was his bride
And they laid them by the Altar in the valley of the gun

Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my momma put the rags to use
There were rags of many colors
Every piece was small
And it was way down in the fall
Momma sewed the rags together
Sewin every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors
That I was so proud of
As she sewed, she told a story
From the bible, she had read
Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you
Good luck and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it
And momma blessed it with a kiss
My coat of many colors
That my momma made for me
Made only from rags
But I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money
Well I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me
So with patches on my britches
and holes in both my shoes
I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing
And making fun of me
in my coat of many colors
My momma made for me
And oh I couldn't understand it
For I felt I was rich
My momma sewed in every stitch
And I told em all the story
Momma told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colors
Was worth more than all their clothes
But they didn't understand it
And I tried to make them see
That one is only poor
Only if they choose to be
Now I know we had no money
But I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me
Made just for me

Why you never see bright colors on my back
And why does my appearance seem to have a sombre tone
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on
I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down
Living in the hopeless hungry side of town
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime
But is there because he's a victim of the times
I wear the black for those who've never read
Or listened to the words that Jesus said
About the road to happiness through love and charity
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me
Well, we're doing mighty fine I do suppose
In our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought to be a man in black
I wear it for the sick and lonely old
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold
I wear the black in mourning for the lives that could have been
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men
And I wear it for the thousands who have died
Believing that the Lord was on their side
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died
Believing that we all were on their side
Well, there's things that never will be right I know
And things need changing everywhere you go
But till we start to make a move to make a few things right
You'll never see me wear a suit of white
Oh, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day
And tell the world that everything's o-kay
But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back
Till things are brighter, I'm the man in black

down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered,
so many times that my memories are worn.
And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County,
down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking,
Mr. Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River,
to the abandoned old prison down by Adrie Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols,
but empty pop bottles was all we would kill.
And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County,
down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking,

Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel,
and they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken,
then they wrote it all down as the progress of man.
And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County,
down by the Green River where Paradise lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking,

When I die let my ashes float down the Green River,
let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin',
just five miles away from wherever I am.

3 conductors and 25 sacks of mail
All along a southbound oddyssey, and the train pulls out of Kankakee
And rolls along past the houses, farms and fields
Passin' trains that have no name, and freightyards full of old black men
The graveyards of the rusted automobiles
Good mornin' America, how are you?
Sayin' don't you know me?, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done.
Dealin’ card games with the old men in the club car.
Penny a point, ain’t no one keepin' score
Pass the paper bag that holds that bottle.
Hear the wheels rumblin' ‘neath the floor.
And the sons of Pullman Porters, and the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpet made of steel
Mothers with their babes asleep are rockin’ to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel.

Sayin' don't you know me?, I'm your native son

Changin’ cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Half way home, and we'll be there by mornin'
Through the Mississippi darkness rollin’ down to the sea.
And all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again the passengers will please refrain
This train has got the disappearin’ railroad blues
Good mornin' America, how are you?
Sayin' don't you know me?, I'm your native son

dreamed the police heard everything I thought... what then?
well I went to court and the judge's name was Hoffman

He said, ""This is my last fight.
And if they take me back to Texas,
They won't take me back alive"".
There were Seven Spanish Angels,
At the Altar of the Sun.
They were praying for the lovers,
In the Valley of the Gun.
And when the battle stopped, and the smoke cleared,
There was thunder from the Throne.
And the Seven Spanish Angels,
Took another Angel home.
She reached down and picked the gun up,
That lay smoking in his hand.
She said, ""Father, please forgive me,
I can't make it without my man"".
And she knew the gun was empty,
And she knew she could not win.
But her final prayer was answered,
When the rifles fired again.

and ten days on the road are barely gone

yes, and hey it's good to be back home again

and what's the latest thing the neighbors say? 
And your mother called last Friday, Sunshine made her cry;
and you felt the baby move just yesterday

and feel your fingers feather soft upon me 
The kisses that I live for, the love that lights my way 
the happiness that living with you brings me

""Son, my life is over, but yours is just begun.
Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done.
Walk away from trouble if you can.
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek.
I hope you're old enough to understand:
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man.""

In her arms he didn't have to prove he was a man.
One day while he was workin' the Gatlin boys came callin'.
They took turns at Becky.... There was three of them!
Tommy opened up the door and saw his Becky cryin'.
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand.
He reached above the fireplace and took down his daddy's picture.
As his tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again:
""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done.
Walk away from trouble if you can.
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek.
I hope you're old enough to understand:
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man.""
The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom.
One of them got up and met him halfway 'cross the floor.
When Tommy turned around they said, ""Hey look! ol' yellow's leavin'.""
But you coulda heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and blocked the door.
Twenty years of crawlin' was bottled up inside him.
He wasn't holdin' nothin' back; he let 'em have it all.
When Tommy left the barroom not a Gatlin boy was standin'.
He said, ""This one's for Becky,"" as he watched the last one fall.
""I promised you, Dad, not to do the things you done.
I walk away from trouble when I can.
Now please don't think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek,

Starts when the sun goes down.

Of every farm and factory town.
There in the world of weekly wage.  There's always a place out there.
And the names and the faces are the same everywhere.
Well the room is full it's a Friday night
We all want to hear ""Louey-Louey"".
Been a long hard day and a long hard life,
And this is how we make it through it.
It's a blue-collar place,  A red-blooded crowd,
Tonight everythings all right,  In Honky-tonk America.
There's a flashing sign on rain soaked street,
That lights up just about dark.
A welcome beacon on life's highway,
When your weary and when you've lost heart.
Never say it's loneliness,  It's only the drinks and the pain.
But something brings us back here again and again.
Well the room is full it's a Friday night
We all want to hear ""Proud Mary"".
Been a long hard day and a long hard life,
We all have our crosses to carry.
It's a blue-collar place,  A red-blooded crowd,

We'll talk about freedom alright,
But maybe some other time.  Tonight everybodys feelin' fine.

why everything's the same as it was?
I can't understand..no, I can't understand..

Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world?..

Cause the tables have turned and I'm finally learning to live and forgive and 
There's no sweet revenge at loves angry end and we all need to know
When the last curtain falls with a final goodbye
And the bitter cold darkness of night floods the days of our light
With a silence so loud we can't feel at all
There's no reason or cause to cheer or applause when the last curtain falls

And the shoreline disappears

Fly back there with me
Where the phosphor shines
Green flashlights from the sea

Our hearts were free from toil
And we made love on the kitchen table

Seven shades of blue
And with the ocean's roll
I will wave to you
And the birds will sing my laughter
And the whales will steal my song

And the world will get along

 Is not this the land of Beulah? Blessed, blessed land of light,
 Where the flowers bloom forever, And the sun is always bright!
I can see far down the mountain, where I wandered weary years,
 Often hindered in my journey by the ghosts of doubts and fears;
 Broken vows and disappointments thickly sprinkled all the way,
 But the Spirit led, unerring, to the land I hold today.
I am drinking from the fountain, Where I ever would abide;
 For I’ve tasted life’s pure river, And my soul is satisfied;
 There’s no thirsting for life’s pleasures, Nor adorning, rich and gay,
 For I’ve found a richer treasure, One that fadeth not away.
Tell me not of heavy crosses, Nor of burdens hard to bear,
 For I’ve found this great salvation makes each burden light appear;
 And I love to follow Jesus, gladly counting all but dross,
 Worldly honors all forsaking for the glory of the cross.

They both weep softly as he’s placed in her arms.
While just one floor below them cries a family in grief
For a loved one crossed Jordon their maker to meet.
A handsome young man walks the isle with his bride
The onlookers proudly wipe tears from their eyes.
A few short years later the papers are filed.
As they both cry in anger in a fight for their child.
Winding through life, runs a river of tears
flowing deep with emotions with each passing year.
Tears of pain and joy, tears of gain and loss
Time and again we must cross the river of tears.
Two teen-age solders march bravely to war
To battle for freedom on some distant shore.
One returns safely to tears of great joy
While the other's folks morn for the loss of their boy.
Winding through life, runs a river of tears
flowing deep with emotions with each passing year.
Tears of pain and joy, tears of gain and loss
Time and again we must cross the river of tears.
Sooner or later we'll cross
The river of tears

Seems like he just don’t care

And I never could've known it would be like this 
You got the kind of charm that I can't resist 
I figure what's the harm in a little bitty kiss or two 
But I fell in love, (Whatcha wanna do that for) 
But I fell in love, (Whatcha wanna do that for)  
I fell in love 
Took me by surprise, put me on the floor 
Right between the eyes with a two by four 
Just a little taste and 
I fell in love 
I was doing fine out on my own 
Never sitting home by the telephone 
I couldn't complain that I didn't have much to do 
I was a two fisted woman looking for a fight 
Had a boy on my left, a boy on the right 
But you burned me up like a chicken in a barbeque 
But I fell in love, (Whatcha wanna do that for) 
But I fell in love, (Whatcha wanna do that for)  
Oh I fell in love 
Didn't see it coming into view 
I was overwhelmed and overdue 
I ain't gonna sweat it 
I fell in love

Well I fell in love, (Whatcha wanna do that for) 
I fell in love, (Whatcha wanna do that for)

I may be a fool but I don't care 
I never knew what hit me 
I fell in love 
But I fell in love, (Whatcha wanna do that for) 
I fell in love, (Whatcha wanna do that for)

Sure enough - that made my buddy real mad

Well, Sir, he pulled out a big, long switch blade knife
Quick as a whistle he began to slice
That big mean drunk stood back, his face full of tears
Lookin' down at the floor, at one of his ears
Ha, he cut that thing off even with the sideburns
Well, ya might say the little Mexican fella, he just didn't give a dern
But he was a gentleman about it - An' bent over and with a half way grin
Picked it up and handed it back to him
He said, ""Now big man, the next time you get the urge to spit a little beer
You just open up your hand there and spit it in your own ear
Won't be no trouble that way"", that's what I heard him say

set us up
a round of that Colorado Cool-Aid
And while you're up there, bring this big fella here, a box of Bandaids""

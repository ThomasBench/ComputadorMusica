Thinkin' maybe that your love has died
 There it is, I can see it in your eyes

'Cause I've hurt you so, you know your sorrow shows
And you just can't stay ...
  Oh but you can't let go

When that final whistle blows and the stock's all in the pen
The coliseum's quiet except for the sounds
Of cowboys getting ready and the workmen of the grounds
The cowboys ask each other, what each other's got
Did you draw ol' Necklace or pluck old Double-Ought
The tension now is mounting as the crowd starts pouring in
A shiver goes all through me like from a cold cold wind
I hear the horses comin' runnin' down the alleyway
They're snortin' and a blowin' as men shut the sliding gates

Hey rookie can you take ten head have you got the heart
You think you're a tough cowboy we'll find out in the end
When that final whistle blows and the stock's all in the pen
We had too much time a while ago but not enough time now
The Anthem is now over the grand entry's going out
I sit there on my bronc I'm ready and I wait
I hear a chute gate open so I look out through the gate
A horse comes boiling out and blows up at the roof
And then there comes another kicking like a curly wolf
I hear the chute boss holler through the yelling of the crowd
He says there's one ahead of you so you'd better get screwed down

I run my spurrs into his neck and then I drag 'em out
My mind is in a blur my eyes are seeing red
The flank catch slams into my back, his rump bangs on my head
From somewhere in the background I can hear a buzzer sound
My hand's jerked from the riggin and I crash into the ground
I stumble to my feet as I stagger to the wall
I wonder to myself is it really worth it all

and said to hold my bronc as long as you can
My car broke down in Billings and they just got it put together
I'll be photo finishin' into ole Cheyenne.
Well here I am in Sheridan and it's nine o'clock
in the mornin' and time's a going fast
I just pulled 'er over had some coffee and a doughnut
And I bought the car a brand new tank of gas
Well, I don't know if I'm gonna make it's nine fifteen
I'll be lucky, if I ever get there
By god now what's that I hear, is it a si-reen
Sure enough he got me on his radar
He pulled up behind me and turned on those flashin' lights
A sign that I knew meant to pull 'er over
So I stomped on my brakes and skidded to a halt
I wiped out three reflector posts along the shoulder
He got out of his car and was a walkin' real slow
So I jumped out and met him halfway
He jerked out his gun and said, ""Mister are you crazy?
I ain't never seen nobody drive that way""
I told him take it easy and he could put up that cannon
The way he's shakin', it just might go off
He put up the gun as I explained my situation
He listened to my story, then he coughed
He wrote me out a ticket that seemed to take forever
I took it as I headed for my car.
That cop, he hollered after me and said, ""Hey, cowboy
You better slow down, 'cause you can't outrun this radar""
As I rolled on down the road I was a cursin' and a swearin'
about the ticket that I had just acquired
I wondered if I oughtta pay it or throw it out the window
But I might just set the damn thing a-fire.
So I gunned it once again and was a travelin' down the road
with the gas pedal mashed to the floor
When I came around a curve and right there in the highway
There's more damn sheep than I've ever seen before.
I'm going too fast to ever stop, so I just close my eyes
as the car rolls on through the herd
When I open up my eyes again there's a sheep on the fender
And that herder's saying some mighty awful words
The sweats a drippin' off my hands as I barrel through ole Wheatland
I'm a nervous wreck and I must be a sight
The flies inside this ole car are buzzin' all around me
Guess my twenty-four hour deodorant quit last night.
Sixty, fifty, forty, thirty, twenty miles more
The rodeo starts in an-other eighteen minutes
I pull in through the main gates I hear the anthem playin'
I can't believe it, thank God I finally made it
There's only one more obstacle that's standin' in my way
It's a nitwit with a weekend badge
He's standin' by the gate and as I slide her to a halt
He says,""Where, in the hell, you goin' so dog gone fast?""
I tell him, ""I'm entered, I ain't got time to talk
My horse is in the chute and I'm late""
He says I need to get a pass from the secretary
My eyes get red, my heart fills up with hate.
I yelled, ""You dirty so and so you better let me through""
He asked if I'd re-peat that once again
So I whacked him in the mouth and I left him lyin' there
on his back kickin' in the sand.
I got there just in time to see my bronc come runnin' out
His head and tail was held way up high
I swear he looked right straight at me and grinned and gave a horse laugh
And me, I just stood there and cried.
I turned around feelin' helpless and purely dumbfounded
I looked and what did I see
Three highway patrolmen and a gateman with a fat lip
And they were all a lookin' back at me
Sittin' in the cell now, I've done a lot of thinkin'
about that wild ride I made a month ago
I'm sorry that I'm in this rotten situation
If I could do it again I wouldn't have drove so slow
If I could do it again I wouldn't have drove so slow.

I guess livin' on this train is gettin' to me
I see crystal chandeliers and burgundy
If that conductor only knew all the trouble I've been through
Just to be here on this train once again
If there's nothing in this world I've gotta do
But to ride these rails of steel my whole life through
Then take away these visions that I see
Of crystal chandeliers and burgundy
Of crystal chandeliers and burgundy

46,Only One Night Of The Year,Ronnie Milsap,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ronnie-milsap/only-one-night-of-the-year-chords-3456098,"There's a magic light in the stars tonight
It shines with a wondrous glow
  There's a whisper of love in the silence of
Gently falling snow
There's cookies and milk on the table
Ribbons on bright candy canes
And every child who is able
Has their nose to the window pane
  Cause for only one night of the year
You can see flying reindeer
   And if you believe in Christmas Eve
There's no telling who will appear
With his whiskers and pipe
He comes only one night of the year
  It's the sugar plum world of cinnamon swirls
A hint of pinewood in the air
  As the church bell chimes I count twelve times
And slip into my easy chair
To watch the fire die to an ember
And drift into a winter dre-e_eam
Of a magical night in December
And faith in a sight unseen
  And for only one night of the year
You can see flying reindeer
   And if you believe in Christmas Eve
There's no telling who will appear
With his whiskers and pipe
He comes only one night of the year
  Ummmm   if you believe in Christmas Eve
  Raise a glass of good cheer
Cause wish as we might
It comes only one night of the year

47,Four Strong Winds (ver 3),Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/four-strong-winds-chords-3964957,"Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high
All these things that won't change, come what may
Well, our good times are all gone and I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
Think I'll go out to Alberta, weather's good there in the fall
Got some friends that I could go workin' for
Yet I wish you'd change your mind if I asked you one more time
But we've been through this a hundred times or more
Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high
All these things that won't change, come what may
Well, our good times are all gone and I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
If I get there 'fore the snow flies and if things are looking good
You could meet me if I sent you down the fare
But by then it would be winter, not much for you to do
And the winds can sure blow cold away out there
Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high
All these things that won't change, come what may
Well, our good times are all gone and I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way

The kids run out to play the game that kids all play
To a child the world is milk and honey
A dime is a lot of candy money
Oh ain't it funny now ain't it funny
Running barefoot through the fields in the rain
Chasing pretty butterflies in the lane
The world's a mess and they wonder why
Oh what a pretty blue blue sky
Gee ain't it funny now ain't it funny
The kids all say grownups are strange and aren't they
They teach their kids not to do as I do but as I say
They cry for peace and then make wars
And wonder what they're fighting for
Oh ain't it funny now ain't it funny
Oh gee ain't it funny now ain't it funny

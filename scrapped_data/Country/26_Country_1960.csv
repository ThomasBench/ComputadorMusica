I guess that things will never be the same
But I must forget that she is gone

Making plans shaking hands
Try to prove that I'm a man
It's hard to do but I must try 
Cause life goes on  and so will I
It's been kinda tough these last few days
Trying to act normal and be gay
It's not easy to be all alone 
But time goes by  and life goes on
If I see her anywhere
I hope she thinks that I don't care
For after night there comes the dawn
Yes time goes by  and life goes on

Then she and I walked hand in hand on the banks of Ponchartrain
I pinned a flower on her heart, I swore we'd never be apart
She vowed her love forever and as I kissed her did the same
Dorraine, my Dorraine, my dark haired little angel
My belle of Ponchartrain
We sat down on the dock and with our hearts and fingers locked
We laughed and talked and joked about when our names are the same
And joking I said honey are you marrying me for money
And it took just one quick look to tell it hurt my dear Dorraine
She jumped and stood above me and she cried why you don't love me
I'm rowing home across the lake you won't see me again
I called and called some more but she rowed fast from the shore
And the clouds brought by a wind began to rain on Ponchartrain
Dorraine, my Dorraine, my dark haired little angel
My belle of Ponchartrain
The storm should make her learn that she should make a swift return
But as the rain fell harder I lost sight of my Dorraine
As panic gripped my heart I drew the oars and made my start
To look for her on raging waters and the rain on Ponchartrain
At darkness I still called but no one heard my cries at all
And when the daybreak came then others helped me look for my Dorraine
But there was not a thing afloat except the oars from her rowboat
For all was lost upon the choppy waves and rain on Ponchartrain
Now I come day after day to where my sweetheart rowed away
And I gaze across the water of the rainy Ponchartrain
Just one thing and nothing more ever floated back to shore
Was this flower I hold it is the one I pinned on my Dorraine
Dorraine, my Dorraine, my dark haired little angel
My belle of Ponchartrain

I asked about the bridal suite, I told him I'm the groom
Then I took the elevator to the floor I was assigned
I fumbled with the key the way I did that other time
Inside I thought of all the things that started in this room
But I'm alone on our second honeymoon
I hear the happy people laughing in the street below
But the loneliness I feel tonight I hope you never know
The life that was a happy song has ended much too soon
And I'm alone on our second honeymoon
I look around the room and see you standing everywhere
The fragrance of your bridal flowers seems to fill the air
The blushing bride that gave me such a free and eager kiss
Two loving arms around me as you offered wedded bliss
We'd said that we'd return to live it over in this room

shot my woman down I went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' .44 beneath my head
Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun, Took a shot of cocaine and
away I run, made a good run but I ran too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico
Late in the hot joints takin' the pills, In walked the sheriff from 
Jericho Hill He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty heck that shot your woman down
Said yes, oh yes my name is Willy Lee, If you've got the warrant just 
a-read it to me, shot her down because she made me sore
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more
When I was arrested I was dressed in black, they put me on a train and they 
took me back, had no friend for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail
Early next mornin' bout a half past nine, I spied the sheriff coming 
down the line, Ah, and he coughed as he cleared his throat He said 
come on you dirty heck into that district court
Into the courtroom my trial began Where I was handled by 
twelve honest men, Just before the jury started out
I saw the little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes in walked the man, Holding the verdict in 
his right hand, The verdict read murder in the first degree

Promise you'll always go straight

I bet my clothes and my money

Was one card and that was a queen

Each man took one from the draw
I drew the one that would beat them
I turned it and here’s what I saw
I saw my mother's picture

To a store down in old San Antone
He stood at the window and I heard him say
Do I have a letter from home
The postmaster looked through the mail that had come
Then smilingly shook his grey head
The cowpoke looked sadly a moment at him
And these are the words that he said
No letter from home, no letter from home
There's never a letter from home
No message from Mother or none of the others
There's never a letter from home
That night he was shot on the wrong side of town
No more on those plains will he roam
I reached for my Bible and gave it to him
And said son here's your letter from home
If only I had just a little more time
To read it The young cowboy said
I can't take it with me and I must go on
Then he died with his letter unread
The letter from home, the letter from home
No time for the letter from home
The cowboy lay dead with his letter unread
Too late for the letter from home

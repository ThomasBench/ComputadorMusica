Do they ever say where is the lonely friend?
Is my name whispered in your bedside prayers?
Do you feel a vacant spot beside you there?
Well, there's always one more path that I must walk.
And there's people I should sit down with and talk.
And somebody might appreciate the flowers I could 
So, there's always another song to sing.
Do you tell them I was wilder than the wind?
Do you remember that I needed lots of friends?
And at other times I'd rather be alone..
where I could not be found when I was gone.
Well, there's always one more canyon to explore.
To touch the things left by those gone before.
At the top of the tiniest hill, I can feel like I'm 
And there's always another song to sing.

1,The Electrified Donkey,Johnny Horton,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-horton/the-electrified-donkey-chords-3927683,"Well I bought me a donkey about four foot tall
To plough my cotton in the early fall
I had to build a fence to keep my donkey in
I rigged up the wire with a battery charge
To keep my donkey from a-running at large
Corralled by volts of electrified juice
Which way did my donkey go
If you see him let me know
I haven't seen my donkey since
He backed into that electrified fence
Now the first time he backed up against it
He threw back his ears and he had a fit
He jumped up into the stratosphere
I just got word from Albuquerque
A donkey up there was looking for work
Oh how I wish he'd come on back
Which way did my donkey go
If you see him let me know
I haven't seen my donkey since
He backed into that electrified fence
Now more word came from Palamar
A man up there was a-watching the stars
He nearly had himself a stroke
He saw something riding up the rainbow trail
Two long ears and a cockabur tail
Was a donkey heading for the pearly gates
Which way did my donkey go
If you see him let me know
I haven't seen my donkey since
He backed into that electrified fence

Bear tracks, bear tracks lookin' back at me.
You better get your rifle boy before it's too late,
Cause the bear's got a little pig, and headed through the gate.
He's big around the middle, and he's broad across the rump.
Runnin' ninety miles an hour takin' thirty feet a jump.
He ain't never been caught he ain't never been treed,
And some folks say he look a lot like me.
Ole Slew Foot, he's a mighty, mighty bear;
Feet like tubs and long brown hair.
He's 'leven feet tall, and he's twenty feet around,
He's headed up the mountain, boys, so whistle up the hounds.
He's big around the middle, and he's broad across the rump.
Runnin' ninety miles an hour takin' thirty feet a jump.
He ain't never been caught, he ain't never been treed,
And some folks say he look a lot like me.
I saved up my money, and I bought me some bees,
And they started makin' honey way up in the trees.
Cut down the trees, but my honey's all gone,
Old Slew Foot's done made himself at home.
He's big around the middle, and he's broad across the rump.
Runnin' ninety miles an hour takin' thirty feet a jump.
Ain't never been caught, he ain't never been treed,
And some folks say he look a lot like me.
Winter's comin' on, and it's twenty below,
And the river's froze over, so where can he go.
We'll chase him up the gully, then we'll run him in the well,
And shoot him in the bottom just to listen to him yell.
He's big around the middle, and he's broad across the rump.
Runnin' ninety miles an hour takin' thirty feet a jump.
Ain't never been caught, he ain't never been treed,
And some folks say he look a lot like me.

I saw an old mother with silvery hair
She seemed so neglected by those who should care
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair
Her hands were all callused and wrinkled and old
A life of hard work was the story they told
And I thought of angels as I saw her there
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair
Bless her old heart, do you think she'd complain
Though life has been bitter she'd live it again
And carry that cross that is more than her share
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair
It wouldn't take much just to gladden her heart
Just some small remembrance on somebody's part
A letter would brighten her empty life there
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair
I know some youngsters in an orphans' home
Who'd think they owned heaven if she was their own
They'd never be willing to let her sit there
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair
I look at her and I think ""What a shame""
The ones who forgot her she loves just the same
And I think of angels as I see her there
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair

So, you think the battle is over,
and you even lay down your gun.
for you think the battle is done.
Now, boy, hit the dirt, listen to me,
for I'm still the one in command.
Get flat on the ground here beside me
and lay your ear to the sand.
Can you here the deafening rumble?
Can you feel the trembling ground?
that make such deafening sound.
For ev'ry shot fired had an echo
and ev'ry man killed wanted life.
There lies your friend, Jim McKinney.
Can you take the news to his wife?
No, son, the battle's not over;
the battle has only begun.
the part that has blackened the sun.
The fight yet to come's not with cannons,
Nor will the fight be hand to hand.
No one will regroup the forces;
No charge will a gen'ral command.
The battle will rage in the bosom
of mother and sweetheart and wife.
will grieve for the rest of their lives.
Now, quiet, rise from your cover.
Be thankful that God let you live,
to go fight the rest of the battle
for those who gave all they could give.
I see, sir, the battle's not over;
the battle has only begun.
this part that has blackened the sun.
For though there's no sound of the cannon,
and though there's no smoke in the sky,
I'm droppin' my gun and the saber,
and ready for battle am I.

At nineteen years my love was Sarah..she was 
much older than the rest.
Of all the men she said had kissed her, she 
loved the way I kissed her best.
Time has flown and I am older, my years are 
five and thirty-five.
Too late, too late, I've met my lover, a woman 
very much alive.
Lolene, Lolene, your name is music, your nearness 
makes my blood run wild.
Alas, alas, I cannot claim you, compared to me 
you're but a child.
So, one last time I must be with you, and kiss 
the lips that thrilled my heart.
And then goodbye, no more to see you, forever, 
we must be apart.

Love grows no colder, I still feel the same
Life has been empty, but I've learned to live it, Virginia

Oh, Virginia, when will these dreams that I dream of you stop, maybe never

I'm like the dove as it flies through the blue
One mate it chooses, and if it should lose
It remains lonely, and that's how I'm livin', Virginia

I remember it so well though it was many years ago
We both new something happened without a lot to say,
but we had other lives and so we went our separate ways.
But our hearts communicated and every time we passed,
we were gradually building something that would forever last.
As long (as long) as the moon (as the moon) shall rise,
as long (as long) as the rivers (as the rivers) flow, (as the rivers flow),
as long (as long) as the sun (as the sun) will shine,
as long, (as long) as the grass, shall grow.
My heart was calling for you when one night you came along
we danced around each other but then we sang our song.
Our harmony was shaky and the pitch not very true,
but then you gave in to me and I gave in to you.
We had to fight the world and we fought with all we had,
we vowed to be together through the sweet times and the bad.
As long (as long) as the moon (as the moon) shall rise,
as long (as long) as the rivers (as the rivers) flow, (as the rivers flow),
as long (as long) as the sun (as the sun) will shine,
as long, (as long) as the grass, shall grow.
I hear you whisper every night, may I have this dance ?
And though I’m not light on my feet, I always take the chance
We have gone through many storms and often walked through fire,
but always our loving faith took us higher and higher.
We know the mystery of life, its love hard and long,
(I love you) I love you and I always will as long…
As long (as long) as the moon (as the moon) shall rise,
as long (as long) as the rivers (as the rivers) flow, (as the rivers flow),

47,Please Dont Play Red River Valley,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/please-dont-play-red-river-valley-chords-2129461,"Well I see you got yourself a brand new harmonica
Mail ordered from the Steagal's catalogue
Boy I hope you can learn to play it like Lonnie Glossom
And while you added you to oughta learn a verse or two
Of Red River Valley Oh My Darling Clementine or Salty Dog
Oh but please don't play Red River Valley
And how about Polly Wolly doodle all day and see
Then she said farewell to my French harp and me
Well I see you're doin' pretty good on your new harmonica
But don't you think you oughta learn about one more tune you know
See you hold it like you's gonna eat a handful of popcorn
And sometime you suck in and sometimes you blow
But friend now please don't play Red River Valley
And how about Polly Wolly doodle all day
From Wayne Raney in Clint Texas was Red River Valley
Oh then she said farewell to my French harp and me

Joe Bean, see where the gallows stand
Just twenty short years from the day you were born
You died by the hangman's hand
Yes, they're hanging Joe Bean this morning
For a shooting that he never did
He killed 20 men, by the time he was 10, he was an unruly kid
Yes, they're hanging Joe Bean for the one shooting that Joe Bean never did
Well, Joe - your mother is at the Capitol
Asking the governor for a stay
And it's hard on her
Because she knows where you were, on that particular day
You were working Joe Bean, hard working, robbing the Santa Fe
Well, the telegraph wires are humming
Here, the governor's words come through
He said, I can't set you free, it's not up to me, but this much, Joe Bean, I'll do
I'll join your mother in extending Birthday greetings to you

49,Belshazzar,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/belshazzar-chords-701016,"well the bible tells us about a man, who ruled babylon and all its land
around the a city he built a wall, and declared that babylon would never fall
he had concubines and wives, he called his babylon paradise
upon his throne he drank and ate, but for belshazzar it was getting late
for he was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand
 he was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His houses were built upon the sand
while the people feasted and drank their wine, and praised the false gods of his time
all holy things they scorned and mocked, when suddenly all their mocking stopped
for on the wall there appeared a hand, nothing else there was no man
in blood the hand began to write, and belshazzar couldn't hide his fright
for he was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand
 he was weighed in the balance and found wanting
His houses were built upon the sand

City sidewalks, busy sidewalks
Dressed in holiday style
In the air
There's a feeling
Of Christmas
Children laughing
People passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on ev'ry street corner you'll hear
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day
(Strings of street lights)
(Even stop lights)
(Blink a bright red and green)
(As the shoppers rush home)
(With their treasures)
(Hear the snow crunch)
(See the kids bunch)
(This is Santa's big scene)
(And above all this bustle)
(You'll hear)
Silver bells, silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring
Soon it will be Christmas day

There's an Old Christmas Card in an old dusty trunk.

But every time I see a Christmas card, I somehow can't help reminiscing.
 About the very first Christmas that you and I spent together. (whoo, ooh..)
What a beautiful Christmas card you gave me that year.            
 Why I know you must have looked through thousands of cards.      
To find that wonderful poem that still brings a tear to my eye.
I thrill with every word, every line.

it was the summer that I turned eighteen.
We lived in a one-room, run down shack on the 
outskirts of New Orleans.
We didn't have money for food or rent..to say 
the least we was hard-pressed..
when momma spent every last penny we had to buy 
Momma washed and combed and curled my hair..
then she painted my eyes and lips.
Then I stepped into the satin dancin' dress..it had 
a split in the side, clean up to my hip.
It was red, velvet-trimmed and it fit me good.
And standin' back from the lookin' glass was a woman
where a half-growed kid had stood.
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
Lord, forgive me for what I do, but if you want out, 
well, it's up to you.
Now, don't let me down, your momma's gonna you move uptown. 
Momma dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck and she 
kissed my cheek.
Then I saw the tears welling up in her troubled eyes as 
she started to speak.
She looked at our pitiful shack and then she looked at me 
and took a ragged breath..she said, your Pa's runned off 
and I'm real sick and the baby's gonna starve to death.
She handed me a heart-shaped locket that said, to thine own 
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across the toe of 
It sounded like somebody else was talkin' askin', Momma what 
do I do?
She said, just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy, they'll be nice

It wasn't very long after, that I knew exactly what my momma was 
I knew what I had to do, but I made myself this solemn vow..
that I was gonna to be a lady someday, though I didn't know when or how.
But I couldn't see spendin' the rest of my life with my head hung 
down in shame.
I mighta been born just plain white trash but Fancy was my name.
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
It wasn't long after that a benevolent man took me in off the streets.
One week later I was pourin' his tea in a five roomed penthouse suite.
I've charmed a king, a congressman and an occasional aristocrat.
And I got me a Georgia mansion and a New York townhouse flat..
now, I ain't done bad.
Now, in this world there's a lot of self-righteous hypocrites who call 
me bad.
They criticize momma for turning me out, no matter how little we had.
But I haven't had to worry 'bout nothin', now for nigh on fifteen years.
But I can still hear the desperation in my poor momma's voice ringin' in 
my ears.

They're a gift from the loving God

But you dare not take them for granted
Or they'll drift away like smoke
And the warmth of their caring will vanish
Like the chill of the endless nights
Most of my friends are unknowns
And they probably won't rate an obituary
Unless they live and die in small towns
Where nothing much ever happens
But a few of my friends are big people
They'd made the world ring with laughter
Down to it's gaseous burning core
They're famous, sensitive,   talented
And their names are household words
Yet they are no more precious in God's eyes    or in mine
Than those wonderful nobodys who live and die in small towns
Who is your friend?
He's someone who warms you with a nod
Or with the unspoken word in hard times
When you're hurting beyond words
Who is your friend?
She's someone who holds you to her breast
And sighs softly into your hair
When no other medicine can stop the pain
A friend is someone who clinks his glass against yours
At three in the morning when you're lost
And with a few words of encouragement and concern
Makes you realize you aren't really lost at all
Friends come in both sexes and in all shapes and sizes
The most important thing they have in common
Is the ability to share with you your most sky splitting joys
Or your deepest, most awesome sorrows
For they are your friends

48,As Far As Im Concerned (ver 2),Glen Campbell,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/glen-campbell/as-far-as-im-concerned-chords-1820200,"If the morning sun should rise and find that you are 
bored with living and you've changed. 
And because you're not your use to be
perhaps you ought to leave and rearrange.
If the people who were once your friends 
now say unfriendly words it seems to me,
they don't understand your feelings and as far 
as I'm concerned love you should leave.
There are places you will travel and folks are gonna 
look at you no doubt.
Just remember it's not where you are 
but who you are inside thats gonna count.
So if you can only watch yourself 
cause no ones gonna say no when you're free.
Then I think you ought to taste it all 
and as far as I'm concerned love you should see.
You've got innocence and tolerance and confidence 
enough to take you far.
Along the way you might find love 
or even meet a cowboy movie star.
If the world should disagree with you 
and burden you with woahs you cannot bear. 
You can question what they're saying
just the way that kids are doing everywhere. 
But if you just close your mind 
and start to feel that you're the only one whose right.
Then you've lost touch with humanity 
but as far as I'm concerned love it's your life.
Yes as far as I'm concerned girl,   it's your life

49,Youve Still Got A Place In My Heart,Glen Campbell,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/glen-campbell/youve-still-got-a-place-in-my-heart-chords-1792993,"If the one you'd think is true 
ever turns his back on you
You've still got a place in my heart
If every road you take proves 
you made a big mistake
Baby you've still 
got a place in my heart
If I'm a fool to pray 
that you'll return some day
Well then I know a million fools 
that love has made that way
If the yea..rs should make you cry 
don't go on and live a lie
Baby you've still got a place in my heart
If the years should make you cry 
don't go on and live a lie
Baby you've still got a place in my heart

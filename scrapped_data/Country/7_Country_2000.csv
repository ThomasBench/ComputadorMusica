0,Long Time Gone,Dixie Chicks,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/dixie-chicks/long-time-gone-chords-925362,"Daddy sits on the front porch swingin', lookin' out on a vacant field
It used to be filled with burly tobacco now he knows it never will
My brother found work in Indiana, my sister's a nurse at the old folks home
Momma's still cookin' too much for supper and me, I've been a long time gone
Been a long time gone, no I ain't hoed a row since I don't know when
Long time gone and it ain't comin' back again
Delia plays that old church piano, sittin' out on her daddy's farm
She always thought that we'd be together, Lord, I never meant to do her harm
Said she could heard me singin' in the choir, me I heard another song
I caught wind and hit the road runnin' and Lord, I've been a long time gone
Been a long time gone, Lord, I ain't had a prayer since I don't know when
Long time gone and it ain't comin' back again
Now me, I went to Nashville, tryin' to be the big deal.
Playin' down on Broadway, gettin’ there the hard way
Livin' from a tip jar, sleepin' in my car
Hockin’ my guitar, yeah I'm gonna be a star
Now me and Delia singin' every Sunday, watchin' the children and the garden grow
We listen to the radio to hear what's cookin' but the music ain’t got no soul
Now they sound tired but they don't sound Haggard
They got money but they don't have Cash,
They got Junior but they don’t have Hank
Long time gone, no I ain't hit the roof since I don't know when
Long time gone and it ain't comin' back.. 
I said a long time gone, no I ain’t honked a horn since I don’t know when
Long time gone and it ain’t comin’ back again
I said a long time, long time, long time gone, oh it’s been a long time
Long time, long time, long time gone
Oh it's been a long time gone
Long time, long time, long time gone. Yeah, yeah.

1,Arlington,Trace Adkins,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/trace-adkins/arlington-chords-813306,"I never thought that this is where I'd settle down. 
I thought I'd die an old man back in my hometown. 
They gave me this plot of land,
Me and some other men, for a job well done.   
There's a big White House sits on a hill just up the road.
The man inside, he cried the day they brought me home. 
They folded up a flag and told my Mom and Dad:
""We're proud of your son."" 
And I'm proud to be on this peaceful piece of property.
I'm on sacred ground and I'm in the best of company.
I'm thankful for those thankful for the things I've done.
I can rest in peace; 
I'm one of the chosen ones:
I made it to Arlington.
I remember Daddy brought me here when I was eight. 
We searched all day to find out where my granddad lay. 
And when we finally found that cross,  
He said: ""Son, this is what it costs to keep us free.""
Now here I am, a thousand stones away from him.
He recognized me on the first day I came in.
And it gave me a chill when he clicked his heels,
And saluted me. 
And I'm proud to be on this peaceful piece of property.
I'm on sacred ground and I'm in the best of company.
I'm thankful for those thankful for the things I've done.
I can rest in peace; 
I'm one of the chosen ones:
I made it to Arlington.
And everytime I hear twenty one guns,
I know they brought another hero home to us.
We're thankful for those thankful for the things we've done.
We can rest in peace;  
We are the chosen ones:
We made it to Arlington.
Yeah, dust to dust,
Don't cry for us:

I spend all day out on this lake
And hell is all I catch
But today she met me at the door
Said I would have to choose
If I hit that fishin' hole today
She'd be packin' all her things and she
would be gone by noon
Well I'm gonna miss her
When I get home
Right now I'm on this lakeshore
And I'm sittin' in the sun
I'm sure it'll hit me
When I walk through that door tonight
Ya I'm gonna miss her

Now there's a chance
Now, if I hurry
I could beg her to stay

And the weather's perfect

I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there on a balcony in the summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd 
And say ""hello"" 
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said ""Stay away from Juliet"" 
And I was crying on the staircase 
Begging you ""Please don't go"" and I said 
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess 
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes."" 
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew 
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while... Oh, oh
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter 
and my daddy said ""Stay away from Juliet"" 
But you were everything to me
I was begging you ""Please don't go"", and I said 
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone 
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run 
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes.""  
Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel 
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess 
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes.""
Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting,   wondering if you were ever coming around 
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone 
I keep waiting for you but you never come 
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think 
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone 
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes."" 
Oh, oh, oh

  You don't want me back

Long before the sun came up way out in the sticks 
 The headlights showed a two-rut road 
Way back up in the pines 
 First time I heard Johnny Cash 
'Sing I Walk the Line' 
I got my thrill behind the wheel upon my daddies lap 
Grandpa rode co-pilot with a flashlight and a map 
 Cane pole out the window 
It was in the summer time 
 First time I heard Johnny Cash 
Sing 'I Walk the Line' 
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time 
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds 
Because you're mine 
I walk the line 
I never will forget that day, I know the time and place
Sounded like the whole thing came right down from outer space
 I still can see those headlights
and that dashboard in my mind
 First time I heard Johnny Cash 
sing I walk the line
I find it very very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine 
I walk the line
All these long years later it's still music to my ears 
I swear it sounds as good right now as anything I hear 
 I've seen the Mona Lisa 
I've heard Shakespeare read' real fine 
 Just like hearing Johnny Cash 
Sing 'I Walk the Line' 
As sure as night is dark and day is light 
I keep you on my mind both day and night 
And happiness that I've known proves that it's right 
Because you're mine 
I walk the line 
Because you're mine 
I walk the line

Well, I used to go out in a Mustang
a 302 Mach One in green
Till' Me and your mama made you in the back
and I sold it to buy her a ring
And I learned not to say much of nothing
so I figured you already know
but in case you don’t or maybe forgot
I’ll lay it out real nice and slow
Don’t call what your wearing an outfit.
Don’t ever say your car is broke
And don’t worry about losing your accent
cause a Southern Man tells better jokes
Have fun and stay clear of the needle
Call home on your sister’s birthday
Don’t tell them you’re bigger than Jesus
don’t give it away
don’t give it away
Five years in a St. Florian foundry,
they call it Industrial Park.
I worked hospital maintenance and Tech School
just to memorize Frigidaire parts.
But I got to missing your Mama
and I got to missing you too.
So I went back to painting for my old man
and I guess that’s what I’ll always do
So don’t let'em take who you are boy
and don’t try to be who you ain’t.
And don’t let me catch you in Kendale
with a bucket of wealthy-man’s paint.
Don’t call what your wearing an outfit.
Don’t ever say your car is broke.
Don’t sing with a fake British accent.
Boy and don’t act like your family’s a joke.
Have fun, and stay clear of the needle
call home on your sister’s birthday.
Don’t tell them you’re bigger than Jesus
Don’t give it away.

a few fish and some rays,
and I've watched boats sail,
In and out of cinnamon bays,
I've let go of a lover,
who took a piece of my heart,
and prayed many times for forgiveness,
and a brand new start

Alyssa lies to the teachers

As I stepped out the room, I heard her say a prayer so soft and sweet
God bless my mom and my dad
And my new friend Alyssa , oh, I know she needs you bad
Because Alyssa lies to the classroom
Alyssa lies everyday at school
Alyssa lies to the teachers
As she tries to cover every bruise
I had the worst night of sleep in years
As I tried to think of a way to calm her fears
I knew exactly what I had to do
But when we got to school on Monday, I heard the news
My little girl asked me why everybody looked so sad
The lump in my throat grew bigger with every question that she asked
Until I felt the tears run down my face
And I told her that Alyssa wouldn't be at school today
She doesn't lie in the classroom
She doesn't lie anymore at school
Alyssa lies with Jesus
Because there's nothing anyone would do
Tears filled my eyes when my little girl asked me why
Alyssa lies
Oh daddy, oh daddy tell me why

And the first time...ever I kissed your mouth,
I felt the earth move...through my hands.
 Like the trembling heart...of a captive bird
That was there...at my command.
And the first time...ever I laid with you,
I felt your heart...so close to mine.
And I know our joy...would fill the earth,
And last...till the end of time, my love.
  The first time...ever I saw...your...face.

And I tried to come clean, but I guess it's no use

They cleared the street and then they closed the schools

Or was is when your daddy died after he moved to town
And I know your momma calls you good for nothin’
She says her baby is a failure and she don't want you callin’

I’m gonna have your baby this coming June

You could do a little time and save my broken heart

In the deep, dark hills of eastern Kentucky
That's the place where I trace my bloodline
And it's there I read on a hillside gravestone
You will never leave Harlan alive
Well my granddad's dad walked down Katahrins Mountain
And he asked Tillie Helton to be his bride
Said, won't you walk with me out of the mouth of this holler
Or we'll never leave Harlan alive
Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinkin'
And you spend your life just thinkin' of how to get away
No one ever knew there was coal in them mountains
'Til a man from the Northeast arrived
Waving hundred dollar bills said, I'll pay you for your minerals
But he never left Harlan alive
Granny sold out cheap and they moved out west of Pineville
To a farm where big Richland River winds
I bet they danced them a jig, laughed and sang a new song
Who said we'd never leave Harlan alive
But the times got hard and tobacco wasn't selling
And ole granddad knew what he'd do to survive
He went and dug for Harlan coal and sent the money back to granny
But he never left Harlan alive
Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinkin'
And you spend your life just thinkin' of how to get away
Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinkin'

I got a little, 2 bedroom cave here in North Afghanistan
Things used to be real nice and they got out of hand when they moved in
(Ooooo yeah the taliban)       (taliban baby)
Now I ain't seen my wife's face since they came here
They make her wear a scarf over her head that covers her from ear to ear
She loves the desert and the hot white sand
But man she's just like me, nah she can't stand
The Taliban
(Ooo taliban baby)
You know someday soon we're both gonna saddle up and it'll be
Ride Camel Ride
My old lady she'll be here with me, smilin right by my side
We should do just fine out around Palestine or maybe Turkmenistan
We'll bid a fair adieu and flip the finger to the Taliban    
     (Oh  yeah the taliban) (baby)
Now they attacked New York City cause they thought they could win
Said they would, stand and fight until the very bloody end
Mr Bush got on the phone with Iraq and Iran and said 
""Now, you Sons-of-bitches you better not be doin any business with the taliban""
(Taliban baby)
So we prayed to Allah with all of our might
Until those big U.S. jets came flyin in one night
They dropped little bombs all over their    holy land
And man you should have seen em run like   rabbits, they ran

I began to warm and chill
To objects and their fields,
A ragged cup, a twisted mop
The face of Jesus in my soup
Those sinister dinner deals
The meal trolley's wicked wheels
A hooked bone rising from my food
All things either good or ungood.
And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this weighing of the truth.
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die.
I hear stories from the chamber
Christ was born into a manger
And like some ragged stranger
He died upon the cross. Might I say,
it seems so fitting in its way
He was a carpenter by trade
Or at least that's what I'm told
My kill-hand's tatooed E.V.I.L.
across it's brother's fist
That filthy five!
They did nothing to challenge or resist.
In Heaven His throne is made of gold
The ark of his Testament is stowed
All history does unfold.
It's made of wood and wire
And my body is on fire
And God is never far away.
Into the mercy seat I climb
My head is shaved, my head is wired
To enter the bright eye
I go shuffling out of life
Just to hide in death awhile
And anyway I never lied.
And the mercy seat is waiting
And I think my head is burning
And in a way I'm yearning
To be done with all this weighing of the truth.
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
And I'm not afraid to die.
And the mercy seat is burning
And I think my head is glowing
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all this twisting of the truth.
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway there was no proof
And I'm not afraid to die.
And the mercy seat is glowing
And I think my head is smoking
And in a way I'm hoping
To be done with all these looks of disbelief.
And a truth for a truth
And I've got nothing left to lose
And I'm not afraid to die.
And the mercy seat is smoking
And I think my head is melting
And in a way that's helping
To be done with all this twisting of the truth
And a tooth for a tooth
And anyway I told the truth
But I'm afraid I told a lie.

She told me she was pregnant on the day I turned 18
And I did what your supposed to do,  I bought her a ring

I mow the courthouse lawn, watch the prisoners walkin’ past

I lived less like a workhorse, more like a slave.
I thought that one quick moment that was noble or brave
would be worth the most of my life.
So I pointed my fingers, and shouted few quotes I knew,
as if something that's written, should be taken as true.
But every path I had taken and conclusion I drew
would put truth back under the knife. 
And now the only piece of advice that continues to help
is anyone that's making anything new only breaks something else. 
When my time comes,  ooohh-oohhh-ooohh-ooohhhh
So I took what I wanted, and put it out of my reach.
I wanted to pay for my successes, with all my defeats.
And if Heaven was all that was promised to me
why don't I pray for a death?
Now it seems like the unravelling started too soon.
Now I'm sleeping in hallways and I'm drinking perfume,
and I'm speaking to mirrors, and I'm howling at moons,
while the worse and the worse that it gets.

Yes, you can stare into the abyss, but it's starin' right back.

Never knew that I could feel this much

Is more than a reaction to your touch
It’s a perfect passion     and I can’t get enough
The way you look the way you laugh the way you love with all you have
There ain’t nothin' ‘bout you that don’t do somethin' for me
The way you kiss the way you cry the way you move when you walk by
There ain’t nothin' ‘bout you that don’t do somethin' for me

That never knocked me off my feet
  All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby, it’s no mystery
Why I surrender   girl, you got everything
The way you look the way you laugh the way you love with all you have
There ain’t nothin' ‘bout you that don’t do somethin' for me
The way you kiss the way you cry the way you move when you walk by
There ain’t nothin' ‘bout you that don’t do somethin' for me

your smile, your lips, and girl the list goes on and on and on
The way you look the way you laugh the way you love with all you have
There ain’t nothin' ‘bout you that don’t do somethin' for me
The way you kiss the way you cry the way you move when you walk by
There ain’t nothin' ‘bout you that don’t do somethin' for me
The way you look the way you laugh the way you love with all you have
Your dance, your drive, you make me feel alive
The way you talk, the way you tease, by now I think you see
There ain’t nothin' ‘bout you that don’t do somethin' for me

47,Boston,Kenny Chesney,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/kenny-chesney/boston-chords-731420,"She comes from Boston
Works at the jewelry store
Down in the harbor
Where the ferries come to shore
She never really knew how good it would feel
To finally find herself in a place so warm and real
She wears a Red Sox cap
To hide her baby dreads
The girl she was in New England
Is different now and dead
In all the local bars
She flirts and tells the boys while they're talkin'
She's from Boston
She comes from Boston
Talks to her family now and then
Through e-mails and postcards
She tries to explain to them
That education and occupation will have to wait for now
She loves the Rasta, reggae rhythms, her dreams have changed somehow
She wears a Red Sox cap
To hide her baby dreads
The girl she was in New England
Is different now and dead
In all the local bars
She flirts and tells the boys while they're talkin'
She's from Boston
Her toes dig deep and deeper in the sand
She's seduced by the sunsets and her new life at hand
She wears a Red Sox cap
To hide her baby dreads
The girl she was in New England
Is different now and dead
In all the local bars
She flirts and tells the boys while they're talkin'
She's from Boston
She wears a Red Sox cap
To hide her baby dreads
From Boston
She came to this island from Boston

That ole ball park man is back in gear 
Out on 49, man I can see the lights
School's out the night's roll in 
Man just like a long lost friend 
You ain't seen in a while, you can't help but smile
And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo and a yoo-hoo
Bottle (rollin')* on the floorboard
Perfect song on the radio
Sing along cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss, it's a sip of wine
It's summertime
Sweet summertime
Temperature says 93 down at the deposit
And guarantee but that swimmin' hole it's nice and cold
Bikini bottoms underneath
But the boys hearts still skip a beat
When them girls shimmy off them ole cutoffs
The more things change the more they stay the same
Don't matter how old you are 
Man you know what I'm talking bout yeah baby when you got...

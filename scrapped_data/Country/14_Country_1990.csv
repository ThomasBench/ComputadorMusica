0,Like The Rain (ver 2),Clint Black,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/clint-black/like-the-rain-chords-399115,"I never liked the rain until I walked through it with you
Every thunder cloud that came was one more I might not get through
But on the darkest day there's always light, and now I see it too
But I never liked the rain until I walked through it with you
I hear it falling in the night and filling up my mind
All the heaven's rivers come to light; I see it all unwind
I hear it talking through the trees and on the window pane
When I hear it I just can't believe I never liked the rain
Like the rain, I have fallen for you and I know just why you
Like the rain, always calling for you, I'm falling for you now 
Just like the rain.
When the cloud is rolling over, thunder striking me
It's as bright as lightning and I wonder why I couldn't see
That it's always good and when the flood is gone we still remain
Guess I've known all along I just belong here with you, falling
Like the rain, I have fallen for you and I know just why you
Like the rain, always calling for you, I'm falling for you now 
Like the rain, I have fallen for you and I know just why you
Just like the rain.
And when the night falls on our better days
And we're looking to the sky
For the winds that take us high above the plains
I know that we'll find better ways to look into the eye
Of the storms that will be calling
Like the rain, I have fallen for you and I know just why you
Like the rain, always calling for you, I'm falling for you now 
Like the rain         (repeat 6X on CD)

I have romanced millions, with my guitar and a love song
Taj Mahal to Paris, Galveston to Hollywood
I thought I had done it all, then I met you
Now I'm singing a new song, making music for Jesus my King
He is my hero, He's become my everything
Now theres no other song, no higher melody
under Heaven, the greatest love story,
Jesus and me.
People call me a winner, but I know what it means to lose.
I've seen some high times, I've paid some dues.
BUT Paying dues just isn't enough, nothing seemed to satisfy me.
Until I met Jesus, I tell you He's alive and I am free.
Now I'm singing a new song, making music for Jesus my King
He is my hero, He's become my everything
Now theres no other song, no higher melody

Viva Mexico
My eyes just won't stay open
And I dream a dream of home
I dream a dream of home
Where there's coffee on the table
And kindness in your hand
Honey I'll help you when I'm able
But right now I'm feeling bad
Right now I'm feeling bad
So Listen to your heart that beats
And follow it with both your feet
And as you walk and as you breathe
You ain't no friend to me
You ain't no friend to me
The road to Ensenada
Is plenty wide and fast
If you head South from Tijuana
Then I'll see you at last
I'll see you at last
But my eyes they open slowly
And they look around the room
The old man he seems worried
And there ain't no sign of you
There ain't no sign of you
So Listen to your heart that beats
And follow it with both your feet
And as you walk and as you breathe
You ain't no friend to me
You ain't no friend to me
You can offer to the righteous
All the good that you have won
But down here among the unclean
All your good just comes undone
Your good just comes undone
The sisters at the borderline
They're holding out their hands
They're begging me for something Lord
Oh , but I don't understand
I don't understand
So it's adios to Alvero
Tell him to stay between the lines
If he sees that Gabriella girl
Tell her I'll look her up next time
Say I'll look her up next time
Because the road to Ensenada
Is plenty wide and fast
And this time through Tijuana
Well it won't be my last
Well, It won't be my last
So Listen to your heart that beats
And follow it with both your feet
And as you walk and as you breathe
You ain't no friend to me
You ain't no friend to me
No, you ain't no friend of me

Some say it rained, I don't know if it's true.
Well, I can just imagine ten thousand angels cried
That would seem like rain to me and you.
The angels all stood ready to take Him from the tree
They waited for the words from His voice.
And when he asked the father why has thou forsaken me.
They watched the saviour die of his own choice.
I've never seen ten thousand angels cry
But I'm sure they did
As they stood by
And watched the saviour die.
God turned his head away
He couldn't bear the sight
It must have looked like rain
When ten thousand angels cried.
As the sun slipped away
The skies turned to grey
And when Jesus gave his all
That's when the tears began to fall
I've never seen ten thousand angels cry
But I'm sure they did
As they stood by
And watched the saviour die.
God turned his head away
He couldn't bear the sight
It must have looked like rain
When ten thousand angels cried.
It must have looked like rain

till he said, “I'm here to help you ma'am, by the way my name’s Joe”
She said, “I'm from St. Louis and I'm only passing through
When he changed the tire and closed her trunk and was about to drive away
she said, “How much do I owe you?” Here's what he had to say,
You don't owe me a thing, I’ve been there, too.
Someone once helped me out just the way I'm helping you
If you really want to pay me back, here's what you do,
Don't let The Chain Of Love end with you
Well, a few miles down the road the lady saw a small cafe,
but she couldn't help but notice how the waitress smiled so sweet
And how she must have been eight months along and dead on her feet
though she didn't know her story and she probably never will
The lady slipped right out the door and, on a napkin, left a note
there were tears in the waitress eyes when she read what she wrote
You don't owe me a thing, I’ve been there, too
Someone once helped me out just the way I'm helping you
If you really want to pay me back, here's what you do,

On my grampa's farm
I was thirstin' for knowledge
And he had a car
I was caught somewhere between a woman and a child
One restless summer we found love growing wild
On the banks of the river near on a well beaten path
It's funny how those memories they last
Like Strawberry Wine
Seventeen
The hot july moon
Saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
the Green on the Vine
Like Strawberry Wine
I still remember
when thirty was old
My biggest fear was September
when he had to go
A few cards and letters and one long distance call
we drifted away like the leaves in the fall
but year after year I come back to this place
just to remember the taste 
Of Strawberry Wine
Seventeen
The hot july moon
Saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
the Green on the Vine
Like Strawberry Wine
The fields have grown over now
years since the've seen a plow
there's nothing time hasn't touched
Is it really him or the loss of my innocence
I've been missing so much!
Yaaaaaah.
Strawberry Wine
Seventeen
The hot july moon
Saw everything
My first taste of love oh bittersweet
and Green on the Vine

Close your eyes and dream real steady
Maybe just a little will spill on you
The dark don't lie and dreams come true

At lonely miss Lily hiding in the hall
Lily's just praying for the trial to be over
Rosy's just waiting for the axe to fall

The sky's still shiny and the earth's still brown
Tell the judge I'm ready for the vases
Gonna' dance in their faces when the guitar sounds
It won't be long I'll be long gone
I been leaning toward the shadows all along
Those in the know say how it goes
You plan on reaping you better sow
You plan on sleeping you better keep moving
Sleeping ain't allowed around here you know
Tell me please when the rolling's over
Me and my baby gonna' have some fun
Bury our backs in a bed of clover
Smile in style while the sun goes down

You will never leave Harlan alive

And he asked Tillie Helton to be his bride
Said, won’t you walk with me out of the mouth of this holler
Or we’ll never leave Harlan alive
Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you’re drinkin’
And you spend your life just thinkin’ of how to get away

‘Til a man from the Northeast arrived
Waving hundred dollar bills said, I’ll pay you for your minerals
But he never left Harlan alive
Granny sold out cheap and they moved out west of Pineville
To a farm where big Richland River winds
I bet they danced them a jig, laughed and sang a new song
Who said we’d never leave Harlan alive
But the times they got hard and tobacco wasn’t selling
And ole granddad knew what he’d do to survive
He went and dug for Harlan coal and sent the money back to granny
But he never left Harlan alive
Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you’re drinkin’
And you spend your life just thinkin’ of how to get away

And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you’re drinkin’

That's what their daddies' used to tell them boys
     How to ride them bulls
I got a jingle in my jeans                Sore places in between
And I'm leavin' on a saw blade            With a push and a pull
10-4 Buddy, come on back           A horse trailer on a Cadillac
Yeah, we're talkin' to the cowboy          In the Coupe de Ville
Chug-a-luggin' up one side                Slidin' down the other
I'm a lover of the other side of the hill
Turn up that radio               Don't wanna think about a rodeo
Don't wanna think about a round-up            Up in old Cheyenne
It's a crazy circuit                       But still you work it
Turn down that sound, boys       Let's get up and check the scan
Bandana hangin' mirror                 Still wet from ear to ear
We'll, I guess it's true then              What the wise men say
When you ride your last one          Make sure he's the best one
Jump while he's movin'           Tip your hat boys and walk away

I wake up and right away her name is on my lips

Getting stoned all alone on my favorite memory
I'll start lovin' her, but I don't know where to stop

Like the times that we spent
Hiding out from the rain
Under the carnival tent
I laughed and she smiled
It would last for awhile
You don't know what you've got till you lose it all again
Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Listen to my heart break
Everytime she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to my tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go
A cool evening dance
Listening to the bluegrass band
Takes the chill from the air
Until they play the last song
I'll do my time
Keeping you off my mind
But there's moments that I find
I'm not feeling too strong
The boats are steaming in
I watch the sidewheel spin
And I think about her when
I hear that whistle blow
I can't change my mind
I knew it all the time that she'd go
But that's a choice I made long ago

made homemade wine like nobody I know
dropped by one Friday night and said
can you help me Creole
got a little girl waitin' on me and I 
wanna treat her right, he said
I got what you need son, it's 
sittin down in the cellar
he reached through the cobwebs
as he turned on the light and said
There might be a little dust on the bottle
but don't let it fool ya about what's inside
There might be a little dust on the bottle
it's one of those things that gets 
sweeter with time
she was sittin in the 
porch swing as I 
 pulled up the driveway
 my ole heart was racing as she climbed inside
she slid over real close and 
drove down to the lake road
watched the sun fade in that big red sky
 I reached under the front seat and said, 
 now here's something special
it's just been waiting for a night like tonight
 There might be a little dust on the bottle
 but don't let it fool ya about what's inside
 There might be a little dust on the bottle
  it's one of those things that gets 
 sweeter with time
you're still with me, we made some memories
after all these years theres one thing I've found
  some say good love, well it's like a fine wine
 it keeps getting better as the days go by

Half a mile from Tucker Cherry's farm
A quiet girl, with green eyes full of fire
Her daddy's pride and all her mama's charm
Rebecca Lynn, became my heart's desire
Long about the start of second grade
Mrs. Rosenbloom let me sit beside her
So we passed notes and after school we played
Singin' Ring      around the rosy, pocket full of dreams and posies
Patty cake  and baker's man, tag you're  it,  kick the can and I
Think I    hear my mama callin', gotta go
Man I loved her so
High school days,  me   and Becky learnin'
What it really means to be in love
Give and take, holdin' back for heaven's sake and
Fightin' for a week then makin' up
I said, ""Please, Becky won't you marry me?""
Prom night in my car out by    the curb
She was so    surprised, first she laughed and then she cried
And somewhere in my heart I'm sure I heard
Ring     around the rosy, pocket full  of dreams and posies
Patty cake and baker's man, tag you're it    kick the can
Mama flashed the porch light for me, gotta go
Man I loved her so
When love is wrong it dies, and that's the way it goes
But when it's right, your love grows
Laura Jean was born in Tennessee
Now that's a common little miracle I know
But for me and Becky  Lynn, she's the dream that started when we
Fell in love so many years ago
Singin' Ring      around the rosy, pocket full of dreams and posies
Patty cake  and baker's man, tag you're it and kick the can
I think I    hear your mama callin', gotta go
Man I love her so

Real expensive
And no guarantee
So I lie here on the couch
With my heart hanging out
Frozen solid with fear
Like a rock in the ground
But you move me
You give me courage I didn't know I had
You move me
I can't go with you and stay where I am
So you move me
This is how love was to me
I could look and not see
Going through the emotions
Not knowin' what they mean
And it scared me so much
That I just wouldn't budge
I might have stayed there forever if not for your touch
Oh but you move me
Out of myself and into the fire
You move me
Now I'm burning with love and with hope and desire
How you move me
You go whistling in the dark
Making light of it
Making light of it
And I follow with my heart
Laughing all the way
Oh ‘cause you move me
You get me dancing and you make me sing
You move me
Now I'm taking delight in every little thing

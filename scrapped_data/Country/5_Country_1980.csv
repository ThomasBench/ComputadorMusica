You want me to take you back once more
You say you need a helping hand dear
But that's what you told me once before
Walk softly on this heart of mine love
Don't treat it mean and so unkind
Let it rest in peace and quiet love
Walk softly on this heart of mine
I know some day you'll find a new love
I feel your heart has turned to stone
But please let me down real easy
Cause loneliness moves in as you move on
Walk softly on this heart of mine love
Don't treat it mean and so unkind
Let it rest in peace and quiet love
Walk softly on this heart of mine
Walk softly on this heart of mine
Walk softly on this heart of mine

The grave yard shift, midnight 'til dawn
The moon was bright as a readin' light
For a letter from an old friend back home.
And he asked me
Why do you ride for your money
Tell me why do you rope for short pay
You ain't gettin' nowhere
And you're losin' your sha-a-a-are
Boy, you must-a gone crazy out there.
He said last night I ran onto Jenny
She's married and has a good life
Boy you sure missed the track
When you never come back
She's the perfect professional's wife.
And she asked me
Why does he ride for his money
And tell me why does he rope for short pay
He ain't gettin' nowhere
And he's losin' his sha-a-a-are
He must've gone crazy out there.
But they've never seen the Northern Lights
Never seen a hawk on the wing
They've never seen spring hit the Great Divi-i-i-ide
And they've never heard old camp cookie sing.
Well I read up the last of my letter
Tore off the stamp for Black Jim.
When Billy rode up to relieve me
He just looked at my letter and he grinned.
And he said
Why do they ride for their money
Tell me why do they rope for short pay
They ain't gettin' nowhere
And they're losin' their sha-a-a-are
Yeah, they all must be crazy out there.

When me and my grandpa'd get way 
We'd hop in his pickup truck and we'd go to town 
We had a couple chores that we had to do 
It didn't take long before we were through 
Then we'd let the pickup truck just wander around 
We'd make a run to the county dump 
We'd always wave we saw someone        
Grandpa make up a song as we rolled along 
the post office without fail 
We get some feed and we'd check out the mail 
And we never took the same road twice on the way back home. 
I spent a few years out runnin' free 
I spent two or three in New York City 
moved back to Texas tired, hell I'd had enough 
I'd go to Luckenbach on Saturdays 
Cause Hondo had a way to brighten up my day 
He always made me laugh when we rode in his pickup truck 
We'd make a run to the county dump 
We'd always wave when we saw someone 
Hondo'd make up a tale as we rolled along 
the post office without fail 
He'd get some chew and we'd check out the mail 
And we never took the same road twice on the way back home 
Well I miss grandpa and Hondo too 
I really miss the things that we used to do 
So last week I went out and bought me an old pickup truck 
Now me and the kids spend Saturdays 
We do fun things in a simple way 
We love to start the day with a ride in the pickup truck 
We make a run to the county dump 
We always wave if we see someone 
The kids love to make up a song as we roll along 
To the post office without fail 
We get some stamps and we check out the mail

Momma always stopped me short of stealing, 
I guess thats why I had to steal that car,
She told me not to smoke it, but I did and it took me far away,
And I turned out to be, THE ONLY HELL MY MOMMA EVER RAISED.
I pulled into Atlanta 
I had to get some money, and lately I'd learned how to get it fast,
Those neon lights was calling me
and somehow I had to get downtown, 
I reached into the glovebox, another liquor store went down.
And I sing ""Precious Memories,"" take me back to the good ol' days.
I can hear my momma singing, ""Rock of Ages"" clef for me,
She tried to turn me on to Jesus, but I turned on to the devil's ways,
And I turned out to be...THE ONLY HELL MY MOMMA EVER RAISED.
When they put those handcuffs on me, 
But that agent clamped'em tighter, 'til that metal bit into my wrist,
They took my boots and my billfold, 
my fingerprints, and the profile of my face,
Then they locked away, THE ONLY HELL MY MOMMA EVER RAISED.

Before the bailiff comes to forever take you away
Yes judge I got debts no honest man could pay
The bank was holdin' my mortgage they was takin' my house away
Now I ain't sayin' that makes me an innocent man
But it was more than all this that put that gun in my hand
And your honor I do believe I'd be better off dead

And this old porch is like a steaming, greasy plate of enchiladas
With lots of cheese and onions
And a guacamole salad

With iced tea and a waitress

Of G and R and Xs
With that '62 poster

Seventy years of Texas
Who's doing all he can
Not to give in to the city
And he always takes the rent late
So long as I run the cattle
And he picks me up at dinnertime
And I listen to him rattle
He says the Brazos still runs muddy
Just like she's run all along
And there ain't never been no cane to grind
The cotton's all but gone
And you know this brand new Chevrolet
Hell it was something back in '60
But now there won't nobody listen to him
'Cause they all think he's crazy

And remembering the coming back

So I had to sing this song about all the things I knew

Higher than the pine trees growin? tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late De-cember
And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of the Whippoorwill

There's a least a million love songs that people love to sing
And everyone is different and everyone's the same

But there's too much love in this Mississippi heart 
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
Heeeeeeey, hey
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart 
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart 
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
Hey, Louisiana woman, Mississippi man 
We get together every time we can
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart 
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
See the alligator all a waitin' nearby 
Soon or later they know I'm gonna try
It's a goodbye fishin' line see you while ago
With a Louisiana woman waitin' 
Don't look so wide
Louisiana woman, Mississippi man 
We get together every time we can
There's too much love in the Mississippi heart 
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
Well I thought I'd been loved but I never had
Till I was wrapped in the arms of a Mississippi man
Like another hurricane just ripped the coast
That Mississippi River, Lord, I'm gonna swim
Hey, Louisiana woman, Mississippi man 
We get together every time we can
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart 
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
Well the Mississippi River, Lord, it's one mile wide 
And I'm gonna get me to the other side
Gotta have your loving one more time
Too bad alligatior you swim too slow
Hey, Louisiana woman, Mississippi man 
We get together every time we can
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart 
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
But there's too much love in this Mississippi heart 
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
Heeeeeeey, hey
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart 
Too much love in this Louisiana heart
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart 
Too much love in this Louisiana heart

47,Love At The Five And Dime,Nanci Griffith,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/nanci-griffith/love-at-the-five-and-dime-chords-69872,"(intro; repeat as necessary)
   Rita was sixteen years, hazel eyes and chestnut hair
   She really made the Woolworth counter shine
   Eddie was a sweet romancer, and a darn good dancer
   They'd waltz the aisles of the five and dime
   Dance a little closer to me, dance a little closer now
   Dance a little closer tonight
   Dance a little closer to me, 'cause it's closing time
   And love's on sale tonight at this five and dime

48,Picture Cards Cant Picture You (verÂ 2),Blaze Foley,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/blaze-foley/picture-cards-cant-picture-you-chords-2605083,"I didn't try to fall in love with you
Tried everything that I could do
To keep myself from falling
Like I've done so many times
Tried to wash it all away
With anything and every day
I think of all the things we said
When we were all alone
I saw daylight in your eyes
I saw daylight in your eyes
I wish I could but I can't say
Tomorrow's still a day away
I'll always love the times
That I can spend with you
Who can know and who can tell
I never seen a wishin' well
That held what its' supposed to hold but who knows
Maybe somewhere there might be
I saw daylight in your eyes
I saw daylight in your eyes
Time will come and time will go
Can I believe in things I know
Been doing it a long time
Guess I can again
Win or draw no chance to lose
Picture cards can't picture you
But I can see you like you are
When I just close my eyes

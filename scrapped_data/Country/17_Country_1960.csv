0,Mama Say A Prayer (ver 2),Dolly Parton,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/dolly-parton/mama-say-a-prayer-chords-2140773,"The bright lights of the city are a pretty sight to see
Perhaps they're extra pretty to a country girl like me
Temptation waits at every turn and it won't let me be
So mama when you pray tonight, say a special prayer for me
I miss your tender goodnight kiss of love and understanding
The goodnight kisses I get now are cruel and so demanding
So mama when you pray tonight and while you're on your knees
Mama say a special prayer for me
The nights get cold and lonely when you're far away from home
And lonely makes it easy for a good girl to go wrong
Evil eyes search through the night for lonely girls like me
So mama when you pray tonight, say a special prayer for me
I miss your tender goodnight kiss of love and understanding
These goodnight kisses I get now are cruel and so demanding
So mama when you pray tonight and while you're on your knees
Mama say a special prayer for me

She's from where the mountains lean up to the sky
Now she's back among the Rockies where mountain thunders cry
Now the wind from off the mountains wails a sad goodbye
Once in Colorado Springs at the foot of old Pike's Peak
I met a Rocky Mountain girl to my soul her heart let speak
We went to tell her parents and an old grandmother said
If you'll leave these mountains girl you'll wish that you were dead
The next day I took her with me to my far-off Iowa home
Way out on the flatlands where the mountain winds don't moan
Each footstep we took was happy or at least it shoudn't been
But I would find her listening for that same lone mountain wind
She came from the mountains Rocky Mountains eagle-high
She's from where the mountains lean up to the sky
Now she's back among the Rockies where mountain thunders cry
Now the wind from off the mountains wails a sad goodbye
Months passed as fast as antelopes until one fatal dismal dawn
I walked to see morning sun shine down on where she was gone
I'd known that lately she'd been sad women sometimes get that way
I hadn't guessed how much was wrong until that fatal day
She had left the weeping letter homesick with mountain names
She was somewhere in the Rockies and I knew I'd been to blame
So now in Colorado Springs I wait near old Pike's Peak
Where once I met a mountain girl that mountain girl I seek
She came from the mountains Rocky Mountains eagle-high
She's from where the mountains lean up to the sky
Now she's back among the Rockies where mountain thunders cry
Now the wind from off the mountains wails a sad goodbye

And I'm longing to be free, from the road

Every bone, inside my body's aching
And that guard dont care if I live or die
He told me yesterday, son dont try to get away,
Or I'll lay you down to stay, by the road
Yes I'll lay you down to stay, by the road.

In the mountains and the valleys below
And I found a love that's true I know
In Taos, New Mexico.
That night in Taos town, it seemed love was all around
And the pretty little girl I found
A new love was born in Taos.
From the first time we met I knew
Her love would always be true
And I know I'll always love her too
The love that I found in Taos.

Were all that mattered in my life just died

And stashed behind your couch
And it's knowin' I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind
It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said because
They thought we fit together walkin'
It's just knowing that the world
Will not be cursing or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
'Cause she turned and I was gone
I still might run in silence
Tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
You walkin' on the back roads
By the rivers flowin' gentle on my mind
I dip my cup of soup back
From a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron in some train yard
My beard a rustlin' coal pile
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waitin' from the back roads

37,Transfusion Blues,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/transfusion-blues-chords-3625820,"Early one morning while making the rounds
Took a transfusion and I shot my woman down
Went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that loving 44 beneath my head
Got up next morning and I grabbed that gun
Took a transfusion and away I run
Made a good run, but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico
Laid in the hot joint, taking the pill
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said, ""Willy Lee, your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down""
Said, ""Yes, oh yes, my name is Willy Lee
If you've got a warrant, just read it to me""
Shot her down because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy, but she had five more
When I was arrested, I was dressed in black
Put me on a train and they took me back
They slapped my dried-up carcass in that county jail
Into the courtroom, my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out
I saw that little judge commenced to look about
In about five minutes, in walked the man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
Verdict read ""in the first degree""
I hollered, ""Lordy, Lordy, have a mercy on me""
The judge he smiled as he picked up his been
Ninety-nine years in the San Quentin pen
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot my woman down
Come all you gotta listen unto me
Lay off that liquor and let that transfusion be

From a castle of sand

That the lady has died.
Oh what it all goes to show
it ain't my job to say
For who am I to know
why she's actin' this way
Oh once again turn away,
if you're sure that it's done
Tell your prophets to pray,
tell your bandits to run
Take your eyelids of stone,
they won't do you no harm
And take your cross made of bones,
take your flypaper arms
And when everything's placed
in your coffin of gold
Throw a scarf round your face
'cause the subway gets cold
Pack up your sunflower smile
and your bandana blues
Take your worthless denials,
they're all you've got left to lose
Take your Tinker Bell lies
and your weary desires
Take the tears in your eyes,
take your cup full of fire
Ah give your lover a call,
if your legs start to fail
And he'll come break your fall
with a bed full of nails
No need to glance back again,
there ain't nothin' to see
Just this drunken old man
and this woman and me
And you've made it quite plain
that we're just wastin' time
And you say it seems strange
that I'm staying behind
But don't you worry 'bout me,
I can make it alone

and I ain't far from home

0,Dont Cry Darlin,David Allan Coe,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/david-allan-coe/dont-cry-darlin-chords-1232080,"Drunk. Totally Drained.
On the verge of going crazy, on the edge of insane
I know you prayed I'd make it, But I never pulled through
I gave up on going on just like I gave up on you
But don't you cry darlin', though it's a cryin' shame
I was hooked on the whiskey so bad I didn't know my name when I died
Don't cry Darlin', you know it's not your fault
I was stealing time from the devil and I just got caught
(you know hon, David left you so long ago.)
(He didn't want to darling, but his dying words told you so)
(That strong stuff was always his weakness but any man can be a fool)
(I know that he was so ashamed and sorry) 
for all the bad things he did to you

Seek a reason for our bein'
From early youth we search for truth 
To justify our lives
And we live in fear each night 
That we won't see the morning sunlight
So we become a Sunday people 
Who crowd beneath that steeple
And search our hearts for answers 
We hope somehow we'll find
Yet a simple prayer rests your weary soul 
And ease your troubled mind         Simply by sayin'
Lord 
Forgive me enough help to make me strong
I've a will to live 
But it's almost dawn
And I don't want for nothin' 
That I lost along the way
I just wanna take my sorrows 
For the good side of   tomorrow   today
We all are rapidly aging 
And our lives are quickly fading
And rushing to a destiny 
We could long ago forsee
Yet each of us must decide 
Is this all there is to life
And will I find my place in eternity 
Simply by sayin' 
Lord forgive me help to make me strong
I've a will to live 
But it's almost dawn
And I don't want for nothin' 
That I lost along the way

For a memory of a man who's chained and bound
Lord knows you need a man and an understandin' hand

You can't stay in love with a memory
You can't stay in love with a dream

Never dreamin' of the gentle heart they broke
Now she waits by the phone, she waits there all alone
But the only one who ever calls is me
Now I'm a prisoner of a slave to one way love
I wish they'd let him go so I'd be free
Break these chains that bind and release this heart of mine

Took a taxi ride downtown
Were checking out a honkytonks
Waiting for the man to come around
Lined up ten tequilas
Lined up a twenty chase of beer
Put the (glata???) on the barmaid
Said, ""Don't you ever come back in here!""

Acutely aware of the state we was in
Met a nun called Mary in a strip joint
Said she'd guide us through the city of sin
Bought a thousand Marlboro Reds
We got a quart of Bombay gin
Looking for salvation in some out-of-town Comfort Inn
Then Johnny busted down the door
King James Bible in his hand
Eyes burning with a rapture
He'd seen the angels in the Promised Land

At a thousand degrees below zero he buttoned up his vest
It froze clear through to China it froze to the stars above
At a million degrees below zero it froze my logger love

I held her close and it felt so right
She was The Steal Of The Night
Oh yeah she was The Steal Of The Night
He left her lonely and the pickin?s were right
She was The Steal Of The Night.
We danced every slow one the band could play
Was it ever this easy for ol? Jesse James
Had the gold in my hands and the banker was blind
Just inches away from The Steal Of The Night
When the band stopped playing we walked to the car
As I closed the door he ran out of the bar
Saw him shakin? his fist under the parking lot light
As I strolled away with The Steal Of The Night.
She was The Steal Of The Night
Oh yeah she was The Steal Of The Night
He long hair flowin? and her jeans so tight
I held her close and it felt so right
She was The Steal Of The Night
Oh yeah she was The Steal Of The Night
He left her lonely and the pickin?s were right
She was The Steal Of The Night.
She was The Steal Of The Night
Oh yeah she was The Steal Of The Night
He long hair flowin? and her jeans so tight
I held her close and it felt so right
She was The Steal Of The Night
Oh yeah she was The Steal Of The Night
He left her lonely and the pickin?s were right
She was The Steal Of The Night.

46,I Cant See Texas From Here,George Strait,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/george-strait/i-cant-see-texas-from-here-chords-2293165,"Now I come and go as I please
From down here, up North and in-between
But, baby, it's a shame 'cause I always feel the same
When I can't see Texas from here
I can't see Texas from here
No matter how I try and it makes me want to die
So if you see me lookin' down
I'm tryin' not to show this frown
'Cause I can't see Texas from here
I can't say I don't like Tennessee
The people here have all been good to me
So please don't take offense if I start to get intense
It's just 'cause I can't see Texas from here
I can't see Texas from here
No matter how I try and it makes me want to die
So if you see me lookin' down
I'm tryin' not to show this frown
'Cause I can't see Texas from here
I can't see Texas from here
No matter how I try and it makes me want to die
So if you see me lookin' down
I'm tryin' not to show this frown
'Cause I can't see Texas 
I can't see Texas
I can't see Texas from here

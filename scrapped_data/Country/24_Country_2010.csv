0,Ringing In The Year,Turnpike Troubadours,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/turnpike-troubadours/ringing-in-the-year-chords-1768867,"I thought it better not to talk about the letter that you sent
It was no one else's business; it was barely even mine
The situation went the way the situation went
We shook that s**t off of our shoes a hundred thousand times
Well won't you miss your whiskey in the wintertime, my dear?
The way that I've been missing you this fall
And cheap champagne don't dull the pain of ringing in the year
Wondering if you think of me at all
The fool I loved in Kansas was the fool I loved the best
You were fool enough to fall in love with me
We were two tornadoes touching down out in the old midwest
And we did our best at dodging the debris
Well won't you miss your whiskey in the wintertime, my dear?
The way that I've been missing you this fall
And cheap champagne don't dull the pain of ringing in the year
Wondering if you think of me at all
With a little more resolve I might be somewhere else with you
But I'll make no resolution of the kind
So I guess it's just God bless, and you did all that you could do
Let all the claims be forgot and never brought to mind
Two roman candles cut across a January sky
Well won't you miss your whiskey in the wintertime, my dear?
The way that I've been missing you this fall
And cheap champagne don't dull the pain of ringing in the year
Wondering if you think of me at all
Well I still wonder about you sometimes, you know

Well that banker
He keeps calling
Telling us our mortgage is overdue
Gonna plow up the fields
Gonna burn down the house
And the banker he can have it when I'm through
There ain't no silver left in these pockets
There ain't no cornbread, Lord there ain't no wine
That train don't stop around here anymore
It done moved on down the line
Well the tax man
He said old Uncle Sam
Gotta get his share of the rake
He can come around here
He can look for himself
There ain't nothing left he can take
There ain't no silver left in these pockets
There ain't no cornbread, Lord there ain't no wine
That train don't stop around here anymore
It done moved on down the line
I'm gonna go back to Grandaddy's farm
On Cherokee allotted land
It ain't ever been owned by no one but him
Won't be taxed by no other man
There ain't no silver left in these pockets

2,From A Window Seat,Dawes,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/dawes/from-a-window-seat-chords-3429722,"I buckle in my seatbelt and plug my headset in a chair
And to the music, I watch flight attendants move
They are pointing out the exits, but it looks more like a prayer
Or an ancient dance their bloodline reaches through
These planes are good for sifting through
I get time to sit and watch them for a while
You can see everywhere they're going
In how they look out at the clouds each time they smile
And I think 'maybe he's in town for someone's birthday
Or maybe he makes trouble everywhere
But as much he resists the conversation
Between the rivers and the freeways
He knows it's always there'
As the Northwest Passage sits somewhere below me as I sleep
I dream of captains and explorers eating boots
When I ask if I can join them, and they offer one to me
I wake up as my home comes into view
So I reached out down for my notebook to see what impressions could be spun
But it's just buildings and a million swimming pools
So I leaf back through the pages to see where I am from
Or for some crumbling map of what it's leading to
And I find that the hero in this song that I am writing
Doesn't know he's just an image of myself
But as much he resists the conversation
Between the rivers and the freeways
He's somehow always asking them for help
I want to make out all the signs I've been ignoring
How the trees reach for the sky or in the length of someone's hair
Cause when you don't know where you are going
Any road will take you there
So maybe I'm in town for someone's birthday
Maybe I make trouble everywhere
But as much I resist the conversation
Between the rivers and the freeways
I know it's always there
I know it's always there
I know it's always there

I try to get out of bed but I can't seem to start.
When I hit the road, it was freezing and dark.
I hope that it's warmer wherever you are.
I turned to say I'm sorry and I tried to explain.
But the room, it was empty, and bitter, and drained.
No songs from the angels, no blood in my veins,
Could ever replace you and here I remain. 
Oh rain,
Come wash me and keep me and take me away.
New York was a rough place that treated me well.
You bragged of religion and put me through hell.
Maybe I'm better off, maybe it's hard to tell.
When I left you were sleeping through trumpets and bells.
Oh rain,
Come wash me and keep me and take me away.
Just one moment of peace, that would suit me so fine.
But it's echoes and glimpses of beautiful times.
And I'm sure it's much harder on your end then mine,
If you ever pass through here, I'm not hard to find.
Oh rain,
Come wash me and keep me and take me away.

And there's a tire that swings in the air

And big green beans
Spend the summertime naturally high
By chopping wood, for next winters fire

Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all you're cooking
Who are you when I'm not looking
Do you pour a little something on the rocks
Slide down the hallway in your socks
When you undress, do you leave a path
Then sink to your nose in a bubble bath
My oh my, you're so good looking
Hold yourself together like a pair of bookends
But I've not tasted all you're cooking
Who are you when I'm not looking
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know
Do you break things when you get mad
Eat a box of chocolates cause you're feeling bad
Do you paint your toes 'cause you bite your nails
And call up mama when all else fails
Who are you when I'm not around
When the door is locked and the shades are down
Do you listen to your music quietly
And when it feels just right are ya thinking of me
I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know
My oh my, you're so good looking
But who are you when I'm not looking

Two different things, just some words and rings
And time keeps raising the stakes
Tonight I'll find you in my dreams

in the silence of my mind

And your beautiful dreams are illusions
and the song that you sing is not true
After all the tears I've cried
and the times that you have lied
I am still loving after you
I'm a stranger to these streets
A ghost behind these walls
And regrets of more than a few
With a heart that’s hurt and hollow
Broken by the fall
I am still loving after you
And your beautiful dreams are illusions
and the song that you sing is not true
After all the tears I've cried

Deserving of your love
I guess I must not know when to give up

On the shoulder of somebody’s Saturday night
Read the good book, studied it too
But nothing prepared me for livin’ with you
Lock me up tight in these shackles I wear
Tied up the keys in the folds of your hair
And the difference with me is I used to not care
Stockholm let me go home
Once a wise man to the ways of the world
Now I’ve traded those lessons for faith in a girl
Cross the ocean, thousand years from my home
In this frozen old city of silver and stone
Ships in the harbor and birds on the bluff
Don’t move an inch when their anchor goes up
And the difference in me is I’m falling in love
Stockholm let me go home
Let me go home
And the night so long I used to pray for the daylight to come
Folks back home surely have called off the search and gone back to their own
Ships in the harbor and birds on the bluff
Don’t move an inch when their anchor goes up
And the difference in me is I’m falling in love

Let me go home

A thousand miles from both our mothers
Barely old enough to rust.
Here we sit, pretending both our hearts are anchored
Taking candy from these strangers 
Amidst the diesel and the dust.
Here we sit, singing words nobody taught us.
Drinking fire and spitting sawdust
Trying to teach ourselves to breathe.
We haven't yet, but every chorus brings us closer
Every flyer and every poster 
Gives a piece of what we need.
And the sand that they call cocaine cost you twice as much as gold
You'd be better of to drink your coffee black
But I swear the land it listened to the stories that we told
God bless the busted boat boat that brings us back
Mornings rough, it don't give a damn about the mission
Has no aesthetic or tradition,
Only lessons never learned.
And I'd had enough, about a month ago tomorrow.
Parting holds no trace of sorrow 
For the bitter and the burned.
And the piss they call tequila even Waylon wouldn't drink
Well I'd rather  sip this Listerine I packed
But i swear I've never seen a better place to sit and think
God bless the busted ship that brings us back
And the sand that they call cocaine cost you twice as much as gold

Of our wedding day
Ripped it down the middle
And threw my half away
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
She broke all my fishing rods
Put my guns in hock
Threw my clothes out in the yard
And changed out all the locks
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
She fired up my old hot rod
Ran it in the pond
Put sugar in my John Deere
I can’t even mow my lawn
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
She built her a bonfire
With my old six string
Took all my good whiskey
And poured it down the drain
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song

But I won't be climbing them no more
There's too many boys been down that way before
I'd rather be
On my Triumph '73
Town is watching as I pass
Throwing shadows on the working class
I was once like them but now I'm flying fast
Straight out of town as the rain patters down
I can hear his footsteps fall
Walking through your lamp-lit hall
He looks like a child, I look like nothing at all
The way I sail
Behind a stormy veil
Now you're slipping off your gloves
His heart is beating like a frightened dove
Just another fool
In the dreaded art of love
So long, Sue
Though I know not what I'll do
Ain't gonna join the marine corps
Ain't gonna fight no rich mans war
There's too many boys gone down that way before

On my Triumph '73
Now I'm passing over the planes
95 in the passing lane
Chasing the wind
Despite it driving away
Way out west
Though I wish you all of the best

And we crash on the coastline, 
But only our love will last till the end
Fortune is fleeting
Time is deceiving
Bodies are weak and they turn into dust
All following blindly, 
But love is like lightning, 
It strikes only one time
And ain't it enough?
Ain't it enough, 
To live by the ways of the world
To be part of the picture
Whatever it's worth?
Throw your arms around each other 
And love one another
For it's only one life that we've got
And ain't it enough?
Surely all people were made for each other
To join in together when the days turn to dusk
So the let the prison walls crumble, 
And the borders all tumble
There's a place for us all here
And ain't it enough?
Ain't it enough, 
To live by the ways of the world
To be part of the picture

Throw your arms around each other 
And love one another
For it's only one life that we've got

Feeling the wind blow, 
Tall through to the tree tops, 
Warm in the sun, 
Lying beside you, 
Watching the moon rise, 
If that's all there is babe, 
Then ain't it enough?
Show me a river, 
I'll show you an ocean,
With stars just like diamonds, 
All shining above 
Oh, where the heavens are beaming, 
And all the worlds dreaming, 
For peace everlasting, 
And ain't it enough?

Friend to raise the glass,

It makes you feel understood

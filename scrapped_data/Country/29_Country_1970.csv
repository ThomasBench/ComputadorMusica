0,Kiss The World Goodbye (ver 2),Kris Kristofferson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/kris-kristofferson/kiss-the-world-goodbye-chords-1950269,"I never had no regrets boys, not for nothing I've done.
I owed the devil some debts boys and paid them all up but one.
And I don't even re-gret the living that I'll be leaving be-hind.
I've gotten weary of searchin' for something I couldn't find.
I'm going down to the shade by the river one more time
and feel the breeze on my face before I die.
I'm gonna leave whatever's left of my luck to the losers
then bend me down and kiss the world good-bye.
Come to lucky in lovin', I never had no com-plaints.
They never said I was evil but then I wasn't no saint.
I'm just a river that rolled forever and never got to the sea.
I ain't blamin' no-body, I had it coming to me.
I'm going down to the shade by the river one more time
and feel the breeze on my face before I die.
I'm gonna leave whatever's left of my luck to the losers,
then bend me down and kiss the world good-bye.

I'm strong enough to carry him

So on we go
His welfare is my concern
No burden is he   to bear
We'll get there
And I know
He would not encumber me
He ain't heavy No Lord  
He's my brother

I'm laden with sadness
That everyone's heart
Isn't filled with the gladness

From which there is no return
While we're on our way   to there
Why don't we share.....
And the load   Lord the load
Don't a weigh me down at all
He ain't heavy  No Lord  
He's my brother.....
No Lord He ain't heavy
No no Lord
He's my brother.........

And dwell upon the happiness of way back when
'Cause since you said goodbye
The feelings just won't die
And I still long to hold you now and then
A million years have come and gone
And I was sure by now I'd make it on my own
But seeing you today
Took my breath away
And I still long to hold you now and then
Suddenly, I felt myself wondering
If you might wanna try it again
And though I wanted so much to hold you
You smiled and shook my hand
So, I'll exist on dreams again
Of days when we were lovers and not just friends
And even if I find
Another love in time
I still long to hold you now and then
Oh, I still long to hold you now and then

In old Silver City he went to the bad
Way out west with a knife in his hand
At the age of twelve years he killed his first man
Fair Mexican maidens play guitars and sing
Songs about Billy, their boy bandit king
Before his young manhood had reached its sad end
He'd a notch on his pistol for twenty-one men
(x2)
It was on one black night that poor Billy died
He said to his friends, ""I'm not satisfied
There's twenty-one men that I've put bullets through
And sheriff Pat Garrett's gonna make twenty-two""
Well, this is how Billy the Kid met his fate
A big moon was shining and the hour was late
Shot down by Pat Garrett, Silver City's best friend
The poor outlaw's life had reached its sad end

How you saved the movie, stole the show
And if you have no time for all your offers
And if you have no time for all your men
Well I don't expect humility
But what about some good old 
Dishonest modesty
You say that you can understudy
That you can write a song that will make us cry
And you can House and Garden
Well, I know you can Bitch and Screw
No I don't expect humility
But what about some good old 
Dishonest modesty
You try to be unique
Your flower childish vision of life
You're over thirty and underweight
And you hang around with all the clowns
Well I don't expect humility
But what about some good old 
Dishonest modesty
No I don't expect humility
But what about some good old 
Dishonest modesty

Libby, we'll go to Paris
And dance along the boulevards
And have no one to embarrass
Puttin' on the Ritz in style
With an Arab and an heiress
Libby, we'll fly anyway
And leave behind our blues
Half sung melodies
We'll trade them all in
For a Paris breeze
Libby, we'll fly
See how dark the circles grow
In a town that has no light
So many eyes just staring out
Into the bloodshot night
And Libby, I hate to see you cry
And I
Want to share it all with you
And if it brings us to our knees
We'll trade it all in for a Paris breeze
Libby, we'll fly
They say it don't come easy
And they say that love is blind
If you're afraid to be close
Then love is hard to find
And if you spend too much time winning love
There's no time to be kind
And Libby, I'm guilty of your crimes
I'm just another passenger
Travelling on these crazy high seas
Very likely be the same
In a Paris breeze
Libby, we'll fly away
If all our flights are grounded
Libby, we'll go to Paris
And wish we were back home again
Or sailing on the ocean
Just a window and a drink
To set our dreams in motion
But Libby, we'll fly anyway, hey
And leave our blues
Half sung melodies
Trade them all in for a Paris breeze
Libby, we'll fly............

49,Another Puff,Jerry Reed,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jerry-reed/another-puff-chords-1774436,"I know there's a lotta talk going around today
About cigarette smoking whittling your life away
I've seen it and I've heard it so many times
That finally it just started to prey on my mind
I guess it scared me a little bit
That's why I decided I was gonna quit
So while I was sitting here forming my battle plan
I took another puff and turned on the fan
I just sat there in my easy chair
And thought of all the money I'd wasted on cigarettes all these years
I thought how I'd spend the rest of my days
After I kick this habit my body craves
Said to myself this ain't gonna be so tough
With that little bit of assurance
I took a puff, a puff, then I ripped off another puff
I decided I'd about had about enough
That breaking this habit won't be too tough
Now I've give a lot of thought to this thing
If I didn't smoke cigarettes I'd feel just like a king
Besides with the price going up every day
I knew I was just throwing all my good money away
You know I ain't lit one in an hour or so?
Just wanted to make sure I could quit you know
I was thinking maybe I oughta write all this down
Put it in a song kinda circulate it around
Can't ever tell it might make a hit
And that redneck Hall did a little bit
Can you imagine me a hit songwriter!
Now where's... Where'd I put that cigarette lighter?
After all it's a habit and a habit you can break
Just a little bit of willpower son that's all it takes
And with that little bit of wisdom
I took a puff, and then a puff, 
then I finally ripped off another puff
And I decided boy this ain't gonna be tough
Besides I'd just about had enough
I'm about ready to quit this rotten habit anyway
Oh I think they ought to take it offa television
It looks too good! Ow!
I like them skinny ones with the filter
Oh give it to me! Give it to me!
Cigarettes... I say if I quit smoking what'll I do?
Maybe I'll eat
Yeah I'll eat cigarettes
Ahh, I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it I love it
Chester B don't smoke
he smokes logs!
Makes you laugh funny too
Oh my throat's scratchin', oh
I wish I could think of something bad to say about cigarettes
Boo on cigarettes, 
don't smoke don't smoke don't smoke
You quit smoking that'll leave more for me!
I love it I love it, no I don't love cigarettes ya know
Don't misunderstand me I hate cigarettes
Makes ya cough, and when ya don't smoke it makes ya shake
I don't know what's worse, the shake or the cough
I think I'll make me a coughshake, oh!
Son did you ever smoke?
Oh I remember one time I quit smoking
I quit for three months
My wife left me
So did my children
She took my house and left
It was a mobile home

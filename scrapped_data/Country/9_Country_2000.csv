0,Before He Cheats (ver 3),Carrie Underwood,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/carrie-underwood/before-he-cheats-chords-436927,"Right now, he's probably slow dancing with a bleach-blond tramp, and she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink, 'cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool stick, showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know
That I dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive,
Carved my name into his leather seat
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights,
slashed a hole in all four tires
And maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Right now, she's probably up singing some white-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying ""I'm drunk"" and he's a-thinking that he's gonna lucky,
Right now, he's probably dabbing 3 dollars worth of that bathroom Polo and he don't know
That I dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive,
Carved my name into his leather seat
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights,
slashed a hole in all four tires
And maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
I might have saved a little trouble for the next girl,
Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
Ohh...not on me
I dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive,
Carved my name into his leather seat
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
And maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats.
Ohh...maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Ohh...before he cheats

Thought that I was young
Now I've freezing hands and bloodless veins
As numb as I've be-come
I'm so tired
I wish I was the moon tonight
Last night I dreamt I had forgotten my name
'Cause I had sold my soul
but awoke just the same
I'm so lonely
I wish I was the moon tonight
God blessed me, I'm a free man
With no place free to go
I'm paralyzed and collared-tight
No pills for what I fear
This is crazy
I wish I was the moon tonight
Chimney falls and lovers blaze
Thought that I was young
Now I've freezing hands and bloodless veins
As numb as I've become
I'm so tired
I wish I was the moon tonight
How will you know if you found me at last?
 'Cause I'll be the one, be the one,
be the one with my heart in my lap
I'm so tired, I'm so tired
I wish I was the moon tonight
I'm so tired, I'm so tired
I wish I was the moon...
I'm so tired, I'm so tired
I wish I was the moon tonight.

2,Whiskey Lullaby (ver 6),Brad Paisley,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/brad-paisley/whiskey-lullaby-chords-2441007,"She put him out like the burning end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart he spent his whole life trying to forget
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
Until the night...
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memo-----ry
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
They found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said I'll love her til I   die
And when we buried him     beneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby
La la la la la la la,  La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la,  La la la la la la la
The rumors flew    but nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away a little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind
Until the night...
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memo-----ry
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the   pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While angels sang a whiskey lullaby

Well she was born in the morning late October San Antone
Aw she's every girl I've ever known
Well she was born in the morning late October San Antone
Aw she's every girl I've ever known
She don't talk about religion she talks about the stones
Oh she's every girl I've ever known
And her tongue is like the Devil when she tries to concentrate
She says she don't want marriage but she still believes in fate
And she stands her ground to defiantly but cries when she's alone
Oh she's every girl I've ever known
Now her voice it is a melody that sings just like a bird
Oh she's every song I've ever heard
And her heartbeat is a rhythm that commands her every word
Oh she's every song I've ever heard
She reflects the world in happiness and echos all the pain
Her smiles the world of sunrise her cries to make it rain
And she hides the truth discretely you'd have to take her word
Aw she’s every song I've ever heard
She's a sober Sunday kitchen conversation with my dad
Aw she's every friend I've ever had
Well we never failed to cut a trail whenever times were bad
Aw she's every friend I've ever had
She's a flighty good time buddy in the corner of the bar
But she'd fight the Devil for ya just for being who you are
And she's the last to cast a stone though she'd love to leave you mad
Aw she's every friend I've ever had
Well she was born in the morning late October San Antone

Barefoot on a summer night
Never could be sweeter than with you
And in the streets you run afree,
Like it's only you and me,
Geez, you're something to see.

knowin that he couldnt have his toy till his nuggets were gone
A green traffic light turned straight to red, I hit my brakes and mumbled under my breath
His fries went a flyin' and his orange drink covered his lap
Well, then my 4 year old said a 4-letter word, 
it started with ""s"" and I was concerned,
So I said son, now where'd you learn, to talk like that.
He said Ive been watchin' you dad ain't that cool,
I'm your buckaroo I wanna be like you
And eat all my food, and grow as tall as you are.
We got cowboy boots and camo pants yea we're just alike hey aint we dad
I wanna do everything you do(hold), 
So I've been watchin you
We got back home and I went to the barn, I bowed my head and I prayed real hard,
Said Lord please help me help my stupid self
Just this side of bedtime later that night, turning on my son's scooby doo night light
He crawled out of bed and he got down on his knees
He closed his little eyes, folded his little hands,
Spoke to God like he was talkin' to a friend,
And I said son, now where'd you learn, to pray like that
He said I been watchin you dad ain't that cool,
Im your buckaroo I wanna be like you,
And eat all my food, and grow as tall as you are,
We like fixin' things and holdin' mama's hand
yea we're just alike hey ain't we dad,
I wanna do, everything you do(hold),
So I've been watchin' you
With tears in my eyes I wrapped him in a hug
Said my little bear is growin' up
And he said but when I'm big, I'll still know what to do.
Cause I've been watchin' you dad aint that cool
I'm your buckaroo I wanna be like you,
And eat all my food, and grow as tall as you are
By then I'll be strong as superman,
We'll be just alike hey won't we dad,
When I can do, everything you do(hold),

 Its the morning of your very first day
 You say hi to your friends you ain’t seen in a while
 Try and stay out of everybody’s way
 It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
 For the next four years in this town
 Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
 You know I haven't seen you around, before
 'Cause when you're fifteen and 
 Somebody tells you they love you
 You're gonna believe them
 And when you're fifteen
 Feeling like there's nothing to figure out
 Well count to ten, take it in
 This is life before you know who you're gonna be
 At fifteen
 You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
 And soon enough you're best friends
 Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
 We'll be out of here as soon as we can
 And then you're on your very first date
 And he's got a car and you're feeling like flying
 And you're momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
 And you're dancing round your room when the night ends
 When the night ends
 'Cause when you're fifteen and 
 Somebody tells you they love you
 You're gonna believe them
 And when you're fifteen
 And your first kiss makes your head spin 'round
 But in your life you'll do things greater than
 Dating the boy on the football team
 But I didnt know it at fifteen
 When all you wanted was to be wanted
 Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
 Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
 But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
 And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy 
 Who changed his mind and we both cried
 'Cause when you're fifteen and 
 Somebody tells you they love you
 You're gonna believe them
 And when you're fifteen
 Don't forget to look before you fall
 I've found time can heal most anything
 And you just might find who you're supposed to be
 I didn't know who I was supposed to be
 At fifteen

11,Luckiest Man (ver 2),The Wood Brothers,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-wood-brothers/luckiest-man-chords-1734141,"My whole saturday and sunday too
I was thinkin''bout ways not to lose
I lay down my weapons is what I've done
Too late to hide, feet too soft to run
But people say I'm the luckiest man
Running is useless and fighting is foolish
You're not gonna win but still you're the luckiest man you're up against
And too many horses and mysterious forces
What you don't know is you are the luckiest man
You're the luckiest man
I done talked to the devil when he calls my name
But sometimes when I'm losing it all seems the same
And when I fall I'm back up again
Just to slip on the same mistakes and slide right back in
But people say I'm the luckiest man
Running is useless and fighting is foolish
You're not gonna win but still you're the luckiest man you're up against
And too many horses and mysterious forces
What you don't know is you are the luckiest man
You're the luckiest man
Try to keep my faith and keep my mind
Hate to lose either one when the whip cracks behind
And I can't help but mourning just a little each night
People say everything is gonna be alright
But people say I'm the luckiest man
Running is useless and fighting is foolish
You're not gonna win but still you're the luckiest man you're up against
And too many horses and mysterious forces
What you don't know is you are the luckiest man
You're the luckiest man

Runnin' thirty minutes late
Singin' Margaritaville and minding my own
Some foreign-car-drivin' dude with a road rage attitude
Pulled up beside me talkin' on his cell phone
He started yellin' at me like I did something wrong
He flipped me the bird an' then he was gone
Some beach
Somewhere
There's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
Palm trees are growin' and warm breezes blowin'
I picture myself right there
On some beach somewhere
I circled the parkin' lot tryin' to find a spot
Just big enough I could park my old truck
A man with a big cigar was gettin' into his car
I stopped and I waited for him to back up
From out of nowhere a Mercedes Benz
Came cruisin' up and whipped right in
Some beach
Somewhere
There's nowhere to go and you got all day to get there
There's cold margaritas and hot Senoritas smilin' with long dark hair
On some beach
Somewhere
I sit in that waitin' room
It seemed like all afternoon
The nurse finally said, ""Doc's ready for you
You're not gonna feel a thing, we'll give you some Novocaine
That tooth will be fine in a minute or two""
But he stuck that needle down deep in my gums
And he started drillin' before I was numb
Some beach
Somewhere
There's a beautiful sunset burnin' up the atmosphere
There's music and dancin' and lovers romancin'
The salty evening air
On some beach

All the crimes and acquisition turn to air and ashen vapor
And the rattle of the shackle far beyond emancipator
And the lowliest who gather in their stalls

I can hear the flowers a-growing in the rubble of the towers

I hear soldiers quit their dying one and all

Hear the gentle lamb of Judah sleeping at the feet of Buddha

She says I should find him
And I'll know peace at last
If I ever find Jesus, I'm kickin' his ass

At that freak in his sandals, with his long pur-ty hair
They must think that I'm stupid, or I don't have a clue
I'll bet he's a commie, or even worse yet a Jew

While she prays for his troubles, has forgot about mine
I'm a-gonna get even, I can't handle the shame
Why last time we made love, she even called out his name
She left me for Jesus, and that just ain't fair
She says that he's perfect, how could I compare
She says I should find him

But there's a warmth on my face that isn't the blood,
and my tears turnin' the snow into mud.
And I can't feel my left leg, but I think it's still there.
Did I kill anybody? Hell, I never fight fare.
What state am I in? Am I still on the run?
Has it really been so long since I've seen the sun?
My instincts are tellin' me to pick up and go,
but I can't feel my fingers, and I can't move my toes.
There's a drained bourbon bottle layin' next to my head,
and the piss and vomit are the sheets in my bed.
Is it you?
Could it be you?
Don't want it to.
I went out all night drinking, so I took the bait;
And I jumped off the interstate to Highway 8;
To the bars full of girls who all know me by name.
They all drink the same drinks, and they all fuck the same.
Now my eyes are turnin' red in this hotel bar,
and she's breathin' out smoke as she motions towards the door.
The kindness of a stranger, or a trick of the trade?
God knows I'm not the first mistake that she's made.

Could it be you?
Don't want it to.
Is it you?
Could it be you?
Don't want it to.

I stored my shame in my belly, 'til i needed to be strong.
In my last guilty moment; Stole a map and a truck.
It's pure chance that I haven't already been picked up.
But from here on the slate's clean. I'm headin' way south.
Always heard the girls were pretty there, I got to find out.
Look ma, your son's a travelin' man.
I don't know what I did, now on I'll do all the good I can...

To make you jealous of me.
The room filled up with mosquitos
They heard that my body was free
And I took the dust of a long sleepless night
And I put it in your little shoe
And I must confess that I tortured the dress
That you wore for the world to look through.
And I showed my heart to the doctor
He said, “You just have to quit”
Then he wrote himself a prescription
And your name was mentioned in it
Then he locked himself in a library shelf
With the details of our honeymoon
And I hear from the nurse that he’s gotten much worse
And his practice is all in a ruin.
I once knew a saint who had loved you
I studied all night in his school
He taught that the duty of lovers 
Was to tarnish the golden rule.
And just when I was sure that his teachings were pure
He drowned himself in the pool
His body is gone, but out here on the lawn
His spirit continues to drool.
An Eskimo showed me a movie
He’d recently taken of you
The poor man could hardly stop shivering
His lips and his fingers were blue
I suppose that he froze when the wind took your clothes
And I guess he just never got warm
But you stand there so nice, in your blizzard of ice
Please let me come into your storm.

Washed in the blood
And raised on the banks
Of the Mississippi mud
She always had a thing
About fallin' in love with a bad boy
Yeah, they could see it all comin'
But her daddy never dreamed
She'd grow up that fast
You know what I mean
The way a girl gets when she turns 17
Kinda crazy 
She's a rebel child
And a preacher's daughter
She was baptized in dirty water
Her mama cried the first time
They caught her with me
They knew they couldn't stop her
She holds tight to me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle
Left her daddy standin' there
Preachin' to the choir you see...God love her
Oh me and God love her
She kissed her mama goodbye
Said I'll be sure 'n phone ya
She called from a truck stop
In Tucson Arizona
With amazing grace
We made California line
And then my gypsy life
Started takin' it's toll
And the fast lane got empty
and out of control
And just like an angel
She saved my soul from the devil
She's a rebel child
And a preacher's daughter
She was baptized in dirty water
Her mama cried the first time
They caught her with me
They knew they couldn't stop her
She holds tight to me and the Bible
On the back seat of my motorcycle
Left her daddy standin' there

Looking at me, telling me you love me, and you're happy to be,

Couldn't take no more of that rock 'n' roll
So we put on a little George Jones and just sang along

To keep you hanging on
And there you were like a queen with your nightgown, riding shotgun from town to town
Staking a claim on the world we found
And I'm singing to you, you're singing to me, you were out of the blue to a boy like me

 That's what I'm doing these days.
Yeah that's what I'm doin'.
 Someone told me after college,
You ran off to Vegas.
You married a rodeo cowboy,
Wow, that ain't the girl I knew.
Me I've been a few places,
Mostly here and there once or twice.
Still sortin' out life, but I'm doing alright.
 Yeah, it's good to see you too.
 Well hey girl, you're late,
And those planes, they don't wait.
But if you ever come back around
Promise me you'll stop in
To see an old friend
And until then...
 I wake up in tear drops,
That fall down like rain.
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I head off to my job,
Guess not much has changed.
 Head for home,
 Check the phone, just in case.
 Go to bed,
 Dream of you,
 That's what I'm doing these...
 I wake up in tear drops,
That fall down like rain.
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I wake up in tear drops,
That fall down like rain.
I put on that old song we danced to and then
I wake up in tear drops,
That fall down like rain.
I put on that old song we danced to and then

47,Dandelion Wine (ver 2),Gregory Alan Isakov,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/gregory-alan-isakov/dandelion-wine-chords-1080338,"   Summer days were just a magazine
A magazine, A magazine…
cutting grass for gasoline,
for gasoline so I can see ya soon…
Fall swooned
left me drunk in a field
dandelion wine for a year
and I packed up the dust
of all that I owned
handkerchief hung from a pole
I rolled out the day that the apples fell…

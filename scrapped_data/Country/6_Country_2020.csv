The reflection hits your eyes
I can't take it any longer
And this rope is pulling tight
Be my anchor, pull me under
In this river here tonight
'Cause I can't breathe when I'm with you
When I'm with you I can fly
When you give in there's a stillness
And a comfort you can find
When you give up there's salvation
In the sweetest suicide
Be my anchor, pull me under
In this river here tonight
'Cause I can't breathe when I'm with you
When I'm with you I can fly
Be my angel
Come and save me
Come and take me
To the other side

1,Ghost,Jack Ingram,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jack-ingram/ghost-chords-3701147,"I burned your Levi's and your pearl snap shirts
Ashes to ashes and dirt to dirt
Buried our love in a deep dark hole
Now you're just a ghost
If you're such a poet, write an epitaph
You and I both know you ain't coming back
I sure loved you but I let you go
And now you're just a ghost
Honey, now you're just a ghost
My spirit's high, so don't you hang around
Silver-tongued devil, you can't hold me down
 Silly boy, only heaven knows
That I ain't a-fraid of ghosts
I replaced the headboard with a chiseled stone
Here lies the meanest man I've ever known
Go rest in peace with every lie you ever told
'Cause now you're just a ghost
Honey, now you're just a ghost
My spirit's high, so don't you hang around
Silver-tongued devil, you can't hold me down
 Silly boy, even heaven knows
That I ain't a-fraid of ghosts
I've got 10,000 angels here to pull me through
I've cried the last tear that I'll cry for you
You're just a shell of a man that I used to hold
But now you're just a ghost
Honey, now you're just a ghost

3,A Man Who Never Cries,Alan Jackson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/alan-jackson/a-man-who-never-cries-chords-3706892,"I was lucky as a child
Mama taught us right from wrong
And how Jesus loves us all
Though they barely did get by
I never saw them cry
They said when things get rough
You gotta pick yourself up
Now, the years have taken me
Down a twisted crazy street
At times I've drifted off
The path that I should walk
Jesus helped me through some hard times
My wife and children by my side
I'm not perfect by a long mile
No matter how I try
But I've been blessed enough in my life
To make up for any strife
If you look closely deep in my eyes
You might see a few happy tears
From a man who never cries
It's hard to let my feelings show
The ones I love don't always know
Like I'm leadin' my horse blind
To a place that I can't find
But I know I can't complain
I've seen more sun than I have rain
When I look at where I've come
Who I am and what I've done, oh I know
Jesus helped me through some hard times
My wife and children by my side
I'm not perfect by a long mile
No matter how I try
But I've been blessed enough in my life
To make up for any strife
If you look closely deep in my eyes
You might see a few happy tears

To see miracles happen that no one can fathom as Heaven invades
 And it's more than a feeling, and it's anchored in praise
And when it's the darkest, it reaches the farthest and opens the way
Don't need to see it (Eyes on You)

Yeah, it's crazy what a song can do
It can make you dance and make you cry

Start a band, and kiss that girl
And break some rules

I woke to the sound of the rain
And the girl from last evening laid silently sleeping
Though I could not remember her name
My head was a pounding and the sweat poured
Around me like the faucet that she left on high
With a chip on my shoulder I'm another day older
And I swear I could break down and cry
I Never once made a dollar, which I didn’t gamble
Or scramble to burn at both ends
I’ve raged all night long, in the hour beforе dawn
On spirits and bitters and blends
What’s left of my day might bе crimson or
Grey but never again black and white
With a chip on my shoulder I'm another day older
And I swear I could break down and cry
I'm a fool with my money and I'm a fool with
My drinking I'm sinking to bottom of the well
Adding fuel to the fire like my wildest desire
Is to spend the next lifetime in hell
I could cruise down to Hades, in a
Snow white Mercedes and a devilish look in my eye
With a chip on my shoulder I'm another day older
And I swear I could break down and cry
There's a hard place on one side and a
Rock on the other, no corners to cut in this maze
Only one way to do it, just to grin and bear through it
I've been drinking up the courage for days
So I’ll drain every cup and keep stacking them up
Till the sun stumbles out of the sky
With a chip on my shoulder I'm another day older
And I swear I could break down and cry
I’ll keep on this way till my dying day
It’s a blessing I’ve tried to disguise
With a chip on my shoulder I'm another day older
And I swear I could break down and cry

In this whole sorry town
To wash off or burn out
The way it all went down
But that cork squeaks so loud
When it’s sneaking its way out
That I’m afraid to death she's going to hear
Now the fire on my tongue
Is for those who die young
And the weariness of we who stay behind
There's poison sickness in my heart
And I don't trust the ashes of my mind
I’ve got too many sorrows
And far too little time
To sit and drown out these memories
Under Tennessee rye
But the salt on the rim
Has me thinking about him
And my shaking hands can't hold back no morе tears
Now the fire on my tongue
Is for those who die young
And the weariness of we who stay behind
There's poison sickness in my heart
And I don't trust the ashes of my mind
Whispering my shame
To the bottom of my glass
Won’t get me through the dawn
Or make the darkness pass
So I’ll hold out tonight
And clench this bottle tight
And drink about the light I saw in you
Now the fire on my tongue

And the weariness of we who stay behind

There's a billion stars in the midnight sky
There's a million cars on the 405
Spinning like it will till the end of time
But what would this world do without you?
The leaves will turn when the air goes cold
And the birds will fly to Mexico
But there's answers I don't wanna know
Like what would this world do without you?
I know the sun will set into the ocean
And I know we're gonna get to where we're going
But I still got just one question that I can't work through
What would this world do without you?
What would this world do without you?
They'd still run the evening news
And the brides will walk the aisle in June
And there's strangers that won't have a clue
What would this world do without you?
I know the sun will set into the ocean
And I know we're gonna get to where we're going
But I still got just one question that I can't work through
What would this world do without you?
I'll keep all your Polaroids hanging on display
And I'll drink all the wine you gave me on my wedding day
Don't know what I would do if your tomorrow never came
The only thing I'm sure of is that I'll never be the same
I know the sun will set into the ocean
And I know we're gonna get to where we're going

 Dark news in from the past
 And all I can feel is the feeling that we'll never say hi if ever we pass
 So, send word to my last known existence
 Lost at last in the wind
 It's all come-ups and clover until it's all over
 You know all good things come to an end
 And if you're thinking about dropping a line
 Tell 'em I'm back on Southern time
 To the city of gold and, baby, I'm told that Jozi is doing just fine
 I'm too easy on giving out chances
 Too long alone on the range
 You might think that I'm strange but I come with a pain
 Of a man scorned again and again
 Some folks think about thеir lovers
 Some folks think about their goals
 I'vе been thinking lately about the way you'd speak to me
 I think it's time I disappear, I'm feeling old
 So if you're thinking about dropping a line
 Tell 'em I'm back on Southern time
 To the city of gold and, baby, I'm told that Jozi is doing just fine
 So, just sit with me morning and nighttime
 Have me on your front porch
 I'll be still, I'll be quiet
 I never knew why it was so hard for me to be who you want
 Yeah, I've thought about finding new lovers
 Thought about burning the past
 All that I want is a kind heart to haunt
 My shrink says it ain't too much to ask

I   cross the border into New Jersey
Where a dotted line from my antenna says
""May no fantasy hold my head up""
Just another day in the polar vortex
Do I   do my thing and just keep my head down?
Or do I eclipse back to Atlanta?    No!
May no fantasy hold my head up
Nor may no memory fold my head in
'Cause I don't know how

Like a dotted line across my shoulder
Like a silver vision across the desert

Where beyond my window a thread of light lives
With Manhattan Island on the dark horizon

 Came around for a one-night thing and I never left
 Got a key to your old front door, you can keep me in the bedside drawer
And when you want you can slide me out again
Take your time, everybody says so
You'll be fine, when you learn to move slow
Oh, how did I lose it at the intro?
Take me, I wanna go
 Ah-ooh, ooh, Malibu
 I wanna go
 Ah-ooh, ooh, Malibu
 I wanna go
To me and you in Malibu
 Never been with a type like you before
 Chilled out, top down, just what I've been looking for
 Pullin' up, got your hair real neat
 Came cruisin' from the coast to scoop me
 And I've been counting down the days to jump back in
Take your time, everybody says so
You'll be fine, when you learn to move slow
Oh, how did I lose it at the intro?
Take me, I wanna go
 Ah-ooh, ooh, Malibu
 I wanna go
 Ah-ooh, ooh, Malibu
 I wanna go

Take me to the ocean blue
I don't care, any beach will do with you, you, you
Singing every song we know
In your transistor radio like doo, doo, doo, doo, doooo

You think you're clever while it's severed
You just fill the air with words you know

I'd carry you anywhere you want me to go
You'd think I'd notice, but I, I never do
Sometimes you're just too tired to make it home
Too much time spent alone trying to pull yourself under
Is that thunder or the sense that someone calls your name
I want back from you all the hours that I cowered
While you corrected everything I'd say
You really found me out, so you used to think
Too much pain and doubt in one little space
I got all this and nothing too
I'd carry you anywhere you want me to go
You think I'd notice, but I, I never do
Sometimes you're just too tired to make it home

Every empty bed in every city I've been
I sit and contemplate all the moments you said
Time stands in a duel and I stand for you
What's that you used to say? Find a love that you can wait for
Or do you feast upon the weak and weary of heart?
I can take the pain but I can't take all the hatred
Laziness of mind and simplest of thoughts
Are you just too old or too young to carry?
Time stands in a duel and I stand for you
Now you're pouring out your hate at every difference you found
You won't even listen to reason at all
Not questioning your faith, far be it from me
But you would speak of love while tying ones hands
Are you just too old or too young to carry?
Time stands in a duel  I stand for you
Are you just too old or too young to carry?
Time stands in a duel  I stand for you
Now lean and use your weight
That's what a shoulder's made for
Carry all the dead and children from here
Curses on the men and the greed that seems to plague them
I can't raise my hand so I'm raising my voice
Are you just too old or too young to carry?

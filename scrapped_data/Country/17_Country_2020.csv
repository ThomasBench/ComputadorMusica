With that first cigarette I smoked
You'da washed my mouth out with soap
I remember that curfew
You said, don't you come home a minute late
And how you were just so lame
 I called you all the names
I could think o-o-of
That painted you in the most colorful li-i-ight
Called you controlling
I called you mean
I called you everything in between
I couldn't wait to break your chains
So I called you names
Now I'm here in
This little one bedroom apartment
Get a wine stain out of the carpet
And we talk for an hour
About my heart, the rent, and the rain
Now, I call you all the names
I can think o-o-of
That paint you in the most beautiful li-i-ight
I call you mama, my best friend
My everything 'til the end
I call you my angel
I call you a saint
Yeah, I call you names
If you'd a told me
How I feel right now about you
And that I call you every day
I would of called you cra-aaaa-zy ooh ooh oohhh
Now, I call you all the names
I can think o-o-of
That paint you in the most beautiful li-i-ight
I call you mama, my best friend
My everything 'til the end
I call you my angel
I call you a saint
Yeah, I call you names
I call you amaaaaa-zing

1,Lonesome As It Gets,Ian Noe,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ian-noe/lonesome-as-it-gets-chords-2819759,"I came home to an empty house after 2 years tried an' true
Made up a rhyme about love and time but had no one to tell it to
I lit a smoke and I threw my coat in the chair where she used to sit
 Ain't that at about as lonesome as it gets
She used to stand by the kitchen door while the sun was coming up
She always tell me if it looked like rain or if the cat crawled on my truck
Now every morning is a quiet mess for these things I can't forget
 Ain't that at about as lonesome as it gets
And no more fire to raise the crane no more track to hold the train
Everything that I thought was love is looking like regret
I used to have some sense of self but I don't know where it went
Feel like a clown neath a paper crown juggling in an empty tent
I wore my feet up a many street and still ain't found it yet
  Ain't that about as lonesome as it gets
And no more fire to raise the crane no more track to hold the train
I been stranded in the rain so long I don't know what's wet
And I got drunk on Christmas night and had an epiphany
Let's end the day in a holy way and set fire to the Christmas tree
While the bulbs were burning down the angel was taking fits
 Ain't that about as lonesome as it gets
 Ain't that about as lonesome as it gets

2,The Father My Son And The Holy Ghost,Craig Morgan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/craig-morgan/the-father-my-son-and-the-holy-ghost-chords-2822870,"Lights are shining bright, as always downtown on the row
I have friends they come from outta town asking me to go
They say, ""There's so much going on,
Why don't you come along and show us around?""
I tell them Karen's not feeling well so I probably shouldn't go out
Besides I've gotta fix it list of things I need to do around the house
Then I hang up the phone, turn the radio back on, and sit back down
I know my boy ain't here but he ain't gone
In the mornings I wake up, give her a kiss, head to the kitchen
Pour a cup of wake-me-up and try to rouse up some ambition
Go outside, sit by myself but I ain't alone
I've got the Father, my son, and the Holy Ghost
I've been beat up, I been pushed and shoved but never ever really knocked down
Between Mom and Dad, Uncle Sam and friends I somehow always pulled out
But the pain of this was more than I'd ever felt before, yeah I was broke
I cried and cried and cried until I passed out on the floor
Then I prayed and prayed and prayed till I thought I couldn't pray anymore
Then minute by minute, day by day, my God, He gave me hope
I know my boy ain't here but he ain't gone
In the mornings I wake up, give her a kiss, head to the kitchen
Pour a cup of wake-me-up and try to rouse up some ambition
Go outside, sit by myself but I ain't alone
See I've got the Father, my son, and the Holy Ghost
I hope, I love, I pray, I cry
I heal a little more each day inside
I won't completely heal till I go home
In the mornings I wake up, give her a kiss, head to the kitchen
Pour a cup of wake-me-up and try to rouse up some ambition
Go outside, sit by myself but I ain't alone
I've got the Father, my son, and the Holy Ghost
One day I'll wake up and I'll be home
with the Father, my son and the Holy Ghost

3,Getting Good Album,Lauren Alaina,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lauren-alaina/getting-good-chords-3020192,"Where I come from they're good at raising
Their hands on Sunday, drinks up high and  a  bunch of babies
Everybody knows, everybody's business
Like who got drunk, who got fired and who's been kissing
Eighteen years old, I hit the road
Didn't plan on lookin' back
But you don't leave with roots that deep
No matter where you're at
It's in my blood, it's in my veins
The way I talk, and the way I pray
If I close my eyes, I'm there right now
You can take the girl out of the country
But the country stays running in my veeeeeeiiiiins
Running in my veeeeeiiiiiins
For a little while, I can tone it down
But a couple drinks or a call from mama brings it out
I'm a sucker for a romance ooh I love a Southern man
To hold my door and hold my hand
Before he gets that kiss
It's in my blood, it's in my veins
The way I talk, and the way I pray
If I close my eyes, I'm there right now
You can take the girl out of the country
But the country stays running in my veeeeeeiiiiins
Running in my veeeeeiiiiiins
You might see me in NYC or California
But you best believe my heart is always still in Georgia
It's in my blood, it's in my veins
The way I talk, and the way I pray
If I close my eyes, I'm there right now
You can take the girl out of the country
But the country stays running in my veeeeeeiiiiins
Running in my veeeeeiiiiiins
It's running in my veins
It's running in my veins
It's running in my veins
It's running in my veins
It's running in my veins
Once I fall in love then I'll be happy
But then you fall in love and there's still a hole
Once I get some money it'll all be easy
But then you get that money, you still feel broke
Once I get a little older, I won't worry
Then you get older and it don't feel like it should
I'm thinking once I learn to grow right where I'm planted
Maybe that's when life starts getting good
Once I get a car that don't stall in the morning
I can make it anywhere I want, just wait
But I can see it right now sitting in my driveway
Afraid if I take it out, I'll chip the paint
Once I get a house that I can hang my hat on
I bet I'll want to build a bigger one if I could, yeah
I'm thinking, once I learn to grow right where I'm planted
Maybe that's when life starts getting good
Oh, getting goooooooooood
Getting goooooooooood
Life starts getting gooooooooood
I'm thinking maybe that's when life starts getting good
            That's when life starts getting good, oh
I'm afraid of both my parents dying
I call my dad, he answers right away
And I didn't hear a word 'cause I was thinking
About what hasn't happened yet but will someday
And we hang up the phone before I know it
I'm crying over the conversation my fear took
I'm thinking once I learn to soak up every moment
I'll realize my life's already good
Already goooooooood
Already goooooooood
Life's already gooooooooood
I'll realize my life's already good
Thank God that my life's already good
Kinda like my first car that I got when I was sixteen (Sixteen)
Had really nice  speakers,  but it came  with broken AC (AC)
Blowing smoke out the engine
Everybody said that it ain't worth the work that it's gonna take to fix it
And I guess I shoulda listened
Now it's kinda funny after all the time and money that I spent to keep it running
I don't even miss it
Sometimes you gotta know when it's time to let go
Sometimes it's hard to see when it's time for you to leave
I think I need an upgrade, boy, it's just too late
We got issues and we can't solve 'em
It's time to treat my heart like that old car
And I'ma let you start being somebody else's problem
Oh yeah, somebody else's problem
I'ma trade you in for a brand new model (Model)
And I hope whoever gets you is a fan of all the drama (Drama)
I hope she likes lying and complaining
Breaking down when it's raining
Maybe she'll give you a better rating, I'm just sayin'
Sometimes you gotta know when it's time to let go
Sometimes it's hard to see when it's time for you to leave
I think I need an upgrade, boy, it's just too late
We got issues and we can't solve 'em
It's time to treat my heart like that old car
And I'ma let you start being somebody else's problem
(Ooh yeah) Ooh yeah, somebody else's problem
You can catch me rolling with the sunroof open
Showing off all over the town, yeah yeah yeah
Looking so fly with my brand new guy, I'm the luckiest girl around
In my leather seats
Yeah, I'mma be blowing around in the summer breeze
No hard feelings, I'll see you around, but this ain't working out
Sometimes you gotta know when it's time to let go
Sometimes it's hard to see when it's time for you to leave
I think I need an upgrade, boy, it's just too late
We got issues and we can't solve 'em
It's time to treat my heart like that old car
And I'ma let you start being somebody else's problem
Oh yeah, somebody else's problem
Somebody else's problem (Oh yeah)
Somebody eeeeeeeeelse's problem
I was born in '94
Daddy drove a beat up Ford
Mama made it run on love and music
The backseats where I started singing
All the songs that got me dreaming
I'd scream ""turn it up,"" and then I'd lose it
I was raised on radio waves
Where the ladies dominated
Sometimes I close my eyes and just replay it
I just wanna feel like ladies in the 90s
Turn the dial and find me some Strawberry Wine
So I can sing all night long, acting like I'm Britney
Come on baby, hit me just one more time, hey
Man, I feel like a woman
I can feel you breathe when you say my name
Hey, I don't want no scrubs
Need a cowboy to take me away
I wanna feel like ladies in the 90's
Ladies in the 90's, hey hey hey
Diva in the living room
Mama's heels on after school
Learning all my moves on MTV
They weren't afraid to make a statement
That's what I call entertainment
All those women paved the way for me
Yeah, southern twang
I was matching all their lipstick
Close my eyes all the time
I wish I could relive it, yeah yeah
I just wanna feel like ladies in the 90s
Turn the dial and find me some Strawberry Wine
So I can sing all night long, acting like I'm Britney
Come on baby, hit me just one more time, hey
Man, I feel like a woman
I can feel you breathe when you say my name
Hey, I don't want no scrubs
Need a cowboy to take me away
I wanna feel like ladies in the 90's
Ladies in the 90's, hey hey hey
Wearing leopard leotards
Moving on in leather pants so shiny
Females were unstoppable
My heart will always be stuck in the 90's, yeah
I just wanna feel like ladies in the 90s
Turn the dial and find me some Strawberry Wine
So I can sing all night long, acting like I'm Britney
Come on baby, hit me just one more time, hey
Here's your one chance, Fancy
Genie in a bottle devote
I'll tell you what I want, what I really really want
I wanna feel like ladies in the 90's
Ladies in the 90's, hey hey hey
I wanna feel like ladies in the 90's
Ladies in the 90's, hey hey hey
You make me wanna take it slow
Like I'm back in my hometown
You  make  me wanna let you lead
In my bare-feet
While you spin  me around
I never wanna say goodnight
Underneath the front porch light
You make me feel just like I'm back in my first love
And I can't get enough of you
You look like a small town southern dream
Boy you fit me just right like my old favorite pair of blue jeans
Got me sayin' Hallelujah
Feels like I always knew you
Boy tell me how do you
Bring out the country in me?
Like a Georges Jones melody
That you put on and keep on repeat
In the summer heat
You bring out the country in me
Your kisses like sweet lemonade
The kind that your mama homemade
It taste better out in the shade
I'm drinkin' it all up
'Cause I can't get enough of you
You look like a small town southern dream
Boy you fit me just right like my old favorite pair of blue jeans
Got me sayin' Hallelujah
Feels like I always knew you
Boy tell me how do you
Bring out the country in me?
Ooh, like a Dolly Parton melody
I'm talkin', 9 to 5, on repeat
In the summer heat
You bring out the country in me
And oh-oh-oh, and you
You look like a small town southern dream
Boy you fit me just right like my old favorite pair of blue jeans
Got me sayin' Hallelujah
Feels like I always knew you
Boy tell me how do you
Bring out the country in me?
Like a George Jones melody
That you put on and keep on repeat
In the summer heat
You bring out the country in me

& I was seeing what was trembling there
On the edge of my restless eyelid
On the tip of the horizon's lash
On the lip of the collapsing letter
In the lap of the confusing moon
I'm reduced to an estranged illusion
I'm consumed by all the shit in my room
Well then maybe if you pick my room up
Carve a path in my moonlit floor
Through the colors I adorn my body with
In ritual
Nowadays I usually just get up

In the shadow, my uniform
I'm torn right through
Divided right in two
I'm lost without using
The brightest light I knew

On the lip of the collapsing letter

Carve a path in my moonlit floor

I'm riding in your pickup on our way to bedlam
Taking in the moonlight, waiting for the rain to come
Crash down on our arms, we won't roll the windows up
As ""It stoned me"" stamps this tree line, that memory of us
I've taken every back road I probably shouldn't take
I've wasted my time and let time waste away my days
Should I let go of the wonder? Let go of the wonder?
I'll find it out beyond the trees

Take away whatever bottled memory you had of me
Take the sorrow and the poison, I dreamt that I might need
Take the battered broken parts, I thought that I might be
Leave them there among the wreckage, make it easier to see
Take the drunken spirit calling, take the reasons that I left
Take the mistake of the fallen, take the couch and take the chest
Take away whatever hope I had of ever feeling
I've taken every back road I probably shouldn't take
I've wasted my time and let time waste away my days

We can't unsee that field of view

Is the truth a work of fiction? Better ask the blood-stained sky

As the moonlight hit the town
But it was High Noon in somebody's head
Before the first boot hit the ground
Spent the day in Cincinnati on the cell phone
Trying to figure out the expense
Stabbing fists into drawn-shade darkness
Battered by experience
There’s something to be said for hangin' in there
Past the point of hangin' ’round too long
Hung out to dry or put away wet
All the same when it all goes wrong
It's all my fault, it's all my fault
When you misconstrue the wonder and the shame
All over town, my name's passed around
'Til you can't tell the darkness from the flame
You can't tell the darkness from the flame
I left my car at the airport
And flew to Kansas City in the rain
I know enough to know I'm standing here soaked
And the weatherman’s to blame
I left the house empty after sunset
With someone else to figure out the stains
I take my responsibility
For the darkness and the pain
It’s all my fault
Everything's my fault
Guess a butcher know how to trim the fat
When it all comes down
Armageddon’s back in town
You can't tell the rabbit from the hat
You can't tell the rabbit from the hat
The dye has been cast
Symbolisms so pronounced
That there's nothing left to wonder or explain
There’ll be no healing
From the art of double-dealing

Seeking some salvation

The evil man's tirades
A joker's motorcade
And military parades
Lives in the balance of the dirty deals made
To win elections
Guns and ammunition, babies in a cage
They say nothing can be done
But they tell us how they prayed
In the end, we're just standin' watchin' greatness fade
Into darkness

Hold your hand, play with your hair,
feel your arms around me
Giving me the best hug
Yeah, we'd be so in love

I wouldn't have to kiss anybody else's lips
I wouldn't have to feel anybody else's touch
We could just be the old you and me
We'd be married, have a house and kids
by this time
And you'd be here tonight

Lay me down in the afternoon
Go a little crazy when I'm in my mood

Wild rose in the pouring down rain
Day fire burning up in flames
To know you is to be forever changed
I am glad it was you who broke my heart
Black coffee and bacon fat
You're an inner city lumberjack
Yeah a country boy through and through
I think that's why I fell for you
Oh honey look what you done done
I know you want it all, go have your fun
But letting go doesn't mean you lose
Cause a part of me lives on in you
I am glad it was you who broke my heart
Cause it had to be you who broke my heart
You may not know a wild rose
Well she needs a lot of room to grow
So now I'm taking a look around
And let me tell you what I found
It's that all our songs remain

Rosemary would sing along
Wheels rolling steady down the way
The ashtray it would fill up twice
The windows down felt nice
As miles stretched the twilight of the day
Driving up I-55
Mississippi zooming by
Salvation in the cool November air
I’m searching for the mixture
That could paint a pretty picture
Of the wind blowing through Rosemary’s hair
Her daddy always said she was the one
Who made the light stars could wish upon
Rosemary with a Bible and a gun
I was more than smitten
By the words as they were written
And the opportunities awaiting there
Our time was etched and promised
Til the truth came down upon us
Descending all our hopes into despair
We took our leave and headed north
A tank at 20 dollars worth
The highway called her name like sirens call
25 and on the run
William Eggleston
Parking lots with neon in the fall
Her daddy’s eyes drew fire into the sun
Asked me why I thought I was the one
His eyes could be deemed worthy to whoever cast upon
Rosemary with a Bible and a gun
One kiss could turn the dark to light, the dawn
This rollercoaster highway can’t compare to the fun
Of Memphis saturated in decay and on the run
Rosemary with a Bible and a gun

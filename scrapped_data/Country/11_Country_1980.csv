When you've been cheating 
And spending your nights on the town 
And who keeps on saying
that he still wants you 
When you're through running around 
And who keeps on loving you 
When you've been lying 
Saying things ain't what they seem

God will but I won't 
Between God and me 
God does but I don't 
God will but I won't

And says that he'll miss you 
And dream of your sweet memory

God will but I won't

God will but I won't

A big riverboat passing us by she’s headed for New Orleans
There she goes disappearing around the bend
Roll on Mississippi you make me feel like a child again
The taste of it takes me back  chewing on a straw torn overalls
A cane pole and old straw hat muddy river just like a long lost friend
Roll on Mississippi you make me feel like a child again
Roll on Mississippi big river roll
You’re the childhood dream that I grew upon
Roll on Mississippi carry me h-ome
Now I can see I’ve been away too long
Roll on Mississippi  roll on
And I need a place to dream  so I come to your banks
I sit in your shade relive the memories Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn
Roll on Mississippi  you make me feel like a child again

Last night I took my girlfriend for a ride
And the way she touched my hand dad
I got this funny feeling deep inside
So I leaned over and I kissed her
I put my arms around her and then
Well she reached out and she slapped me
She said, ""You're just like all the other men""
Son you're talking to the wrong man
If you wanna know what girls are all about
You're talking to the wrong man
Still ain't got your mama figured out
By the way son, I've got a problem
I wonder could you talk with me a while
You see lately your mama she ignores me
Hardly ever gives me a little smile
So I was thinkin' maybe you could show me
The way you younger fellas comb your hair
Think I need to change my style son
Could you show me something really cool to wear?
Dad you're talking to the wrong man
If you wanna know what girls are all about
You're talking to the wrong man
Still ain't got my girlfriend figured out
So I guess we'll just go fishin'
Or maybe head out to that old gold course today
When our buddies ask us about women
I think I know exactly what we'll say
Boys you're talking to the wrong man
If you wanna know what girls are all about
You're talking to the wrong man

Wearin' older faces
And talk about the places they've been
Two old sweethearts who fell apart
Somewhere long ago -        how were they to know
that someday they'd meet again
and have a need for more than reminiscing
Maybe this time it'll be loving they'll find
maybe now they can be more than just friends.
She's back in his life and it feels so right
maybe this time love won't end.
It?s the same old Feeling back again
It`s The one that they had back when
They were too young to know when love is real
But somehow somethings never change
And Even time hasn`t cooled the flame
It`s even Burning brighter than it did before
They got another chance and if they take it
end...
She`s smiling like she use to smile way back then
He`s Feelin like He used to feel way back when they
Tried, But something Kept them, Waiting for this
Magic Moment.
Maybe this time it'll be loving they'll find -
maybe now they can be more than just friends.

The Greyhound stops and somebody gets on
But nobody gets off in this town

Now let me see if I can set the scene
It's a one-dog town and he's old and mean
There's one stop light but it's always green

High school colors are brown
They can't drag main because it kicks up dust
Their cars and their dreams are all startin' to rust
The high school dances are always a bust

Cause in the winter you freeze and in the summer you fry

When you were a little younger
Around me you might have learned a thing or two
If I had known you longer
You might be a little stronger
And maybe you'd shoot straighter than you do
Maybe you'd shoot straighter than you do
As he walked into the poolroom, you could tell he didn't fit
In his handmade boots, custom suits, and pearl handled shooting stick
Tonight there'd be a showdown, then everyone would know
Who shoots the meanest game around - The Baron or Billy Joe
Billy Joe looked edgy, about to lose his cool
But the Baron's hands were steady, as the two began to duel
Yeah, he was like a general on a battlefield of slate
And he'd say to Billy Joe each time he sunk the eight
He'd say...
Wish I had a-known ya
When you were a little younger
Around me you might have learned a thing or two
If I had known you longer
You might be a little stronger
And maybe you'd shoot straighter than you do
Maybe you'd shoot straighter than you do
Now Billy Joe was busted, but he hadn't felt the sting
And from the far end of the table, he threw his mother's wedding ring
And he said ""you won my money, but it ain't gonna do the trick
I'll bet this ring on one more game against your fancy stick""
The Baron's eyes got foggy as the ring rolled on the felt
And he almost doubled over like he had been hit below the belt
Twenty years ago, it was the ring his wife had worn
And he didn't know before he left that a son would soon be born
It sounded just like thunder when the Baron shot the break
But it grew thickly quiet as he lined up the eight
Then a warm hand touched his shoulder and it chilled him to the bone
When he turned and saw the woman who had loved him for so long
The game was never finished; the eight ball never fell
The Baron calmly picked it up and put it on the shelf
Then he placed the ring in the hands that held him long ago
And he tossed that fancy shooting stick to his son Billy Joe
And he said...
Wish I had a-known ya
When you were a little younger
Around me you might have learned a thing or two
If I had known you longer
You might be a little stronger
And maybe you'd shoot straighter than you do
Maybe you'd shoot straighter than you do

And that it drowns the tender reed
And some say love, it's like a razor
And that it leaves your soul to bleed.
Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower
And you, it's only seed.
It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's a dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying
That never learns to live.
When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows

15,Thats My Job,Conway Twitty,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/conway-twitty/thats-my-job-chords-977765,"I woke up crying late at night
when I was very young.
I had dreamed my father
had passed away and gone.
My world revolved around him
I couldnt lay there anymore.
So I made my way down the mirrored hall
and tapped upon his door.
And I said ""Daddy, I'm so afraid
how will I go on with you gone that way?
Don't wanna cry anymore
so may I stay with you?""
And he said ""That's my job,
that's what I do.
Everything I do is because of you,
To keep you safe with me.
That's my job you see.""
Later we barely got along
this teenage boy and he.
Most of the fights it seems
were over different dreams,
we each held for me.
He wanted knowledge and learning.
I wanted to fly out west.
Said, ""I could make it out there
if I just had the fare.
I got half, will you loan me the rest?""
And I said ""Daddy, I'm so afraid,
there's no guarantee in the plans
I've made and if I should fail,
who will pay my way back home?""
And he said ""That's my job
that's what I do.
Everything I do is because of you
to keep you safe with me.
That's my job you see.""
Every person carves his spot
and fills the hole with light.
And I pray someday I might
light as bright as he.
Woke up early one bright fall day
to spread the tragic news.
After all my travel, I settled down
within a mile or two.
I make my living with words and rhyme
and all this tragedy
Should go into my head and out instead
as bits of poetry.
But I say ""Daddy, I'm so afraid,
how will I go on with you gone this way?
How can I come up with a song to say
I love you?""
That's my job, That's what I do
Everything I do is because of you
to keep you safe with me.
That's my job you see.
Everything I do is because of you
to keep you safe with me. GCG

And rose at every sound
Half in hopeless sorrow
And half in fear the day
Would find the soldiers breaking through
To drag us all away
And just before the sunrise
I heard something at the wall
The gate began to rattle
And a voice began to call
I hurried to the window
Looked down into the street
Expecting swords and torches
And the sound of soldiers' feet
But there was no one there but Mary
So I went down to let her in
John stood there beside me
As she told me where she'd been
She said they've moved Him in the night
And none of us knows where
The stone's been rolled away
And now His body isn't there
So we both ran towards the garden
Then John ran on ahead
We found the stone and empty tomb
Just the way that Mary said
But the winding sheet they wrapped Him in
Was just an empty shell
And how or where they'd taken Him
Was more than I could tell
Oh something strange had happened there
Just what I did not know
John believed a miracle
But I just turned to go
Circumstance and speculation
Couldn't lift me very high
Cause I'd seen them crucify Him
Then I saw Him die
Back inside the house again
The guilt and anguish came
Everything I'd promised Him
Just added to my shame
When at last it came to choices
I denied I knew His name
And even if He was alive
It wouldn't be the same
But suddenly the air was filled
With a strange and sweet perfume
Light that came from everywhere
Drove shadows from the room
And Jesus stood before me
With His arms held open wide
And I just clung to Him and cried
Then He raised me to my feet
And as I looked into His eyes
The love was shining out from Him
Like sunlight from the skies
Guilt and my confusion
Disappeared in sweet release
And every fear I ever had
Just melted into peace
He's alive
Yes, He's alive
Yes, He's alive and I'm forgiven
Heaven's gates are open wide
He's alive  (He's alive)
Yes, He's alive  (He's alive)

And show 'em how to raise hell in Caroline

45,Good Morning John,Waylon Jennings,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/waylon-jennings/good-morning-john-chords-3366716,"Good morning John
Ain't it great to see your future shining brighter
Than the naked light of day
You made it John
But I confess there was a time or two
I thought that you might let it slip away
I love you John
In the cold and holy darkness
You were always shinin' brighter than a star
God bless you John
For the love and joy you've given
And the livin' inspiration that you are
You scared me John
Cause you crossed so many borders
Into danger with a price upon your head
They got you John
And it hurt to see so many friends
Who ran along beside you lyin' dead
I know you John
There ain't nothing you can't handle out there
Ain't nothing bigger than your heart
Keep shinin' John
For you owe it to the others
And the dark and holy wonder that you are
Hang in there John
It's a rocky road to glory
But the straightest and the strongest will survive
Keep smilin' John
We won't make it there tomorrow
But today let's say we're lucky we're alive
I'll see you John
Though the best of good intentions
Have a way of gettin' scattered by the wind
I'm leavin' John
You can lose your mind and memory
But you ain't gonna lose me as your friend
Good morning John

and what I saw I did not understand.
I called you names and said some things that hurt you.
And in the heat I started walkin' out that door.
But on second thought I'll just turn around here in my tracks
and walk back into your arms where I belong..I was wrong.
On second thought, I apologize for what I've done,
cause you're the only one I'll always be in love with.
I know it's not your fault that you're so pretty..
and that you turn the head of every man..I understand.
But when I saw you dancing with him I just lost it.
I started thinkin', I don't love you anymore.

As I pull it on to the Interstate
I've got 13 hours to make my destination

There won't be no sleep for me tonight no

I'm a prisoner of the highway
Driven on by my restless soul
Call me a prisoner of the highway
Prison by the freedom of the road
I've run freight out of Wheeling West Virginia
And US Steel from Memphis
I've rolled tobacco out of the Carolina's
California wines into Birmingham

49,The Frozen Logger (ver 2),Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/the-frozen-logger-chords-2131941,"As I step out one morning  into a small cafe,
A forty year old waitress to me these words did say:
She said I see sir you?re a logger, and not just a common bum,
'Cause nobody but a logger stirs his coffee with is thumb.
My lover was a logger, there's none like him today;
If you'd pour a little whiskey up on it he eat a bale of hay
My lover came to see me twas on one freezing day;
He threw his arms around me and broke three vertebrae.
I saw my lover leaving, a-trudging through the snow,
Up going gaily homeward at forty-eight below.
The weather tried to freeze him, it tried its level best;
At a thousand degrees below zero, he buttoned up his vest.
It froze clean through to China, it froze to the stars above;
At a million degrees below zero, it froze my logger love.
And so I lost my lover, and to this cafe I come,
And here I wait till someone stirs his coffee with his thumb.""

0,If I Ever Was A Child,Wilco,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/wilco/if-i-ever-was-a-child-chords-1866999,"I've never been alone
Long enough to know
If I ever was a child
I was tied up like a boat
On a button like a coat
Set free for a while
I'd jump to jolt my clumsy blood
While my white, green eyes
Cry like a window pane
Can my cold heart change
Even out of spite?
I saw behind my brain a haunted stain
It never fades
I hunt for the kind of pain I can take
And I cry like a window pane
Can my cold heart change
Over night?
So I won't ever want to touch
Your heart too much
Or hold you too tight
I saw behind my brain a haunted stain
I'll never fade
I hunt for the kind of pain I can take
I never was alone
Long enough to know
If I ever was a child

Had the world in his hands
An office job, a bank account, and a pretty wife
Friday would come too soon
He would fly you too the moon
His old lady never knew what he was talking about
Don't you fly away boy
Don't you fly away
Don't you fly away boy
You know everything will be OK
Yeah everything will be OK
Monday and he's back to work
Shiny shoes, a tie in his shirt
Everybody loved him so, he had a beautiful smile
A good report a pat on the back
Got his name on the company plaque
But nobody seemed to know that Willy could fly
Oh but don't you fly away boy
Don't you fly away
Don't you fly away boy
You know everything will be OK
Yeah everything will be OK
WIlly was a nobleman
When he lived in Birmingham
But he was losing his mind in a world of his own
Willy left on a rainy day
Wings spread and wind in his face
But nobody knew that Willy could fly
Don't you fly away boy
Don't you fly away
Don't you fly away boy
You know everything will be OK
Yeah everything will be OK
Oh won't you stay Willy stay
Yeah everything will be OK

Well, judge looked down, gave me forty days
Instead of the fine that I could not pay
Said ""Walk right, you'll soon be home
Cross the line, you'll be on your own""
Forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
Forty nights to sit and listen
To the midnight train to Memphis
Well now, whistle blows when the sun comes up
Head to floor, keep your big mouth shut
Eat your breakfast on the ground
Work like hell till the sun goes down
Forty days of shotguns and barbed wire fences
Forty nights to sit and listen
To the midnight train to Memphis
Well now, then for the jury, ten for the judge
Twenty more to forget my grudge
When I get to thirty-nine

4,Banded Clovis,Tyler Childers,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tyler-childers/banded-clovis-chords-2252819,"Tina Nolan had a man with a good place for siftin’
He invited me diggin’ so I picked up my screen
And a shovel to dig and a jar of shine
He traded me fair for a bottle of wine
His brother’s Barnes Mountain wine
We trudged through the snow straight up the hillside
Took a ridge for a while, then we slowly went down
To an overhang  hid from the ridgeline
We bent o'er our handles and we bit in the ground
The dark and bloody ground
Was a bitch to break ground but the wine kept us goin'
The moonshine was flowin' and keepin' us warm
'Cause you can’t hold a girl with a fistful of shovel
Got to find your fire in the company of corn
We dug for a while then it all turned to ashes
Found a bunch of broke flint and a few bits of bone
Then I heard Jesse yell o'er the pile he was sifting
Shook the hills like the angels were callin’ us home
Jesse, Zachary come home
It was banded as hell, it was fluted and clovis
It was hot as the pistol I kept on my side
I was fiending so fierce, I was broke ass and busted
I pulled out my pistol and I took Jesse’s life
A clovis like that is a hard point to find
Makes pills swift to come by with a good chunk of change
Left over for burn on whatever meanness
Whatever woman is comin' my way
Darlin' come my way
I sit in this cell for the banded clovis
I stole off of Nolan when I killed'm that day
I reckon the chase of the pills and the powder
Corn liquor and women are the culprits to blame

6,Most Of All,Brandi Carlile,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/brandi-carlile/most-of-all-chords-2321079,"I haven't seen my father in some time
But his face is always staring back at me
His heavy hands hang at the ends of my arms
And my colors change like the sea
But I don't worry much about time lost
I'm not gunning for the dreams I couldn't find
'Cause he taught me how to walk the best that I can
On the road I've left behind
But most of all
He taught me to forgive
How to keep a cool head
How to love the one you're with
And when I'm far into the distance
And the pushing comes to shove
To remember what comes back
When you give away your love
Give away your love
When you give your love away
Give away your love
I haven't heard my mother's voice in a while
But her words are always falling out my mouth
My mind and spirit are at odds sometimes
And they fight like the north and the south
But I still care enough to bear the weight
Of the heaviness to which my heart is tethered
She taught me how to be strong and say goodbye
And that love is forever
But most of all
She taught me how to fight
How to move across the line
Between the wrong and the right
And when I'm turned out in the darkness
And the pushing comes to shove
To remember what comes back
When you give away your love
Give away your love
When you give your love away
Give away your love
Give your love away
Oh, give your love away
And remember what comes back to you
Give your love away
Oh, give your love away
And remember what comes back to you

But his face is always staring back at me
His heavy hands swing at the ends of my arms

I reckon He knows the feelin' 'tween the now and then
I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place, friend
Lord, won't you help me carry my load?
I borrowed me a hammer, I swung it for a dime
I got to where I finally could afford me mine
But in between the swingin' and the idle time
I got to thinkin' heavy on the road
Now I'm hid out in the upper room
With walls so thin, I could bust right through
Give all my buddies a ramblin' to
About the shit that really blows my mind
Back when I was younger, didn't have a clue
Come to think of it, I still doubt I do
But every now and then, I get to thinkin'
""You know, I've got it all worked out""
I used to take my time and burn it in a bong
Iced down with lights turned off
Somethin' in my speakers I can ponder on
Somethin' I can mull around
Now I'm lit up like a Christmas tree
Check one-two, can y'all hear me?
The sights are somethin', but they ain't for free
Lookin' at 'em, wired for sound
The road goes on forever, the part it will tend
I got a part of me that's wonderin' when
I'll finally kick the urge to roam
A part of me just wants to live forever on the road
Split me down the middle, ship my southpaw home
And if she gets to askin', tell her you don't rightly know
What happened to the rest of me
Aw, weep no more, girl, don't cry
Hellfire, ya married you a Gemini
This is the half of him you always liked
Looky here, his heart still beats

I tie the noose, but you are the rope

I am the dog, you are the shed
I can't find the perk in the percocet
When you're not around
This is the fight that taught me to feel
If I am the drunk, you are the wheel

You are the queen and I am the rook
You are the fire and I burn like a book
I don't know how this one ends till I die
And the honest part of 'reliable' is the lie
The greater the power, the more the abuse
You are the hand, I worship the bruise
If romance is dead, I guess I'm a necrophiliac
Every god needs a sacrifice
I am the cross, and you are the Christ
So I drink till night becomes another day
And the day's just another little thing in our way
Something about the way you beat me down
You're the pint of no return

Down-wind from the paper mill
I'm out here spittin' on the sidewalk
Taking in the factory smells
And I know she tends to smoke 'em out the window
In the air of that gas pipe leak
I wonder if she's cringin' at the same time
Thinking pretty thoughts of me
I was up for hours this morning
Pulling traps before I said goodbye
I plan to tan myself a fox hide
And hang it on my darling bride
'Cause they tell me that it's gonna be a big one
And the snow is settin' in
And I don't want her cold while I ain't at home
The way that I have been
Spending my nights in a bar room, Lord
Turnin' them songs into two-by-fours
Dreaming 'bout the day that I'm sitting by the fire
Huddlin' with my honey in the Country Squire
Well tomorrow we hit the country music highway
On our way to Circleville
We're off to do some weekend warrin'
While we sing and drink our fill
And when I ain't out playing on my six-string
With the nickels I acquire
I'm trying to fix her up a castle
It's called the Country Squire
It's a twenty-four-foot-long vessel
Measures eight feet wide
It's a fifty-three-year-old camper
It's made to pull behind
And I've gutted to the studs and the rafters
And I'm buildin' back piece by piece
I'm trying to fix her up a temple
My lady of the Estill Springs
Spending my nights in a bar room, Lord
Turnin' them songs into two-by-fours
Dreaming 'bout the day that I'll sit by the fire
Huddled with my honey in our Country Squire
One day I aim to have myself a family
And a cabin on the hill
And I might have to come off of the highway
To help with the family bills
But when the kids've got a little older
On the day that I retire
I'll take her somewhere warm for the winter
Pullin' our Country Squire
Spending my nights in a bar room, Lord
Turnin' them songs into two-by-fours
Dreaming 'bout the day that I'll sit by the fire
Huddled with my honey in our Country Squire

Said some things to wounded men that they could not allow
When it came to talking, he was always on the run
Everyone knew what the man had done
Oh, he'll take you for a ride
Jimmy believed in the American way
A prison guard, he worked hard and made the minimum wage
He found his freedom locking men in a cage, oh
Jimmy loved Bonnie and he fathered a kid
A baby boy, but the mother had other reasons to live
She left the baby with a note on the bed, oh
It was a struggle just to cover the rent
His jail cut hours and hours little baby was sick
He needed money and he needed it quick
It was 3 AM
Oh, my love, oh, my love
Could you spare my blood, spare my blood?
Jim woke his son and buckled him in the car
They drove an hour from town and found a gambling hall
The waitress babysat the boy at the bar, oh no
After an hour, Jimmy doubled his cash
He took his kid and his winnings as the dealer just laughed
He said they leave, but then they always come back, that's a fact
Out on the road, they caught a stranger in the lights
His thumb was up and his son asked if the man was alright
Jim said you never give a hitcher a ride 'cause it's us or them
It was 3 AM
Oh, my love, oh, my love
Could you spare my blood, spare my blood?
20 years gone and now the boy is a man
Broke Jimmy's habits, got in mountains and mountains of debt
And now the sharks are coming back to collect, oh-oh
They stripped his jewelry and the boots off Jim's feet
They kick him out the car and say we'll give you a week
Eight miles from home and only 18 degrees
It was 3 AM
Oh, my love, oh, my love
Could you spare my blood, spare my blood?
Now Jimmy's son is trying to make his way home
His graveyard shift had ended and it was starting to snow
He sees an old man walking barefoot alone
It was 3 AM
His old man waved his hands with tears in his eyes
But Jimmy's son just sped up and remembered daddy's advice
No, you don't ever give a hitcher a ride 'cause it's us or them
Cause it's me or him

And it's not theirs to speculate
If it's wrong and your hands are tough 
but they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you
faith with this song for you
Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos 
will be ignored cause my heart is yours
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high
The waters rough
But this love is ours

Always left out, never fit in
Owning that path you're walking in

Now, your buddies get their rocks off on Top 40 radio
But you love your daddy's vinyl, old-time rock and roll
Elvis Costello, Ray Wylie Hubbard,

First time I met Alabama Hannah, I was skinny as a rail
Red hair tied up in a blue bandanna; she was hotter than the devil's Hell
She turned me on to Back Porch Pickers, Jackson Pollock, and gin
Her daddy didn't trust my intentions, so he turned to his daddy's old .410
I'm Mr. Misunderstood,          Mr. Misunderstood
Had an ax to grind, so off I went
Mad at the sun for coming up again
I lost religion, found my soul in the blues
Rubbed the velvet off my blue suede shoes
Yeah, everybody held up their hands
And every soul on Beale Street danced
With Mr. Misunderstood,         Mr. Misunderstood
So I went with it like a colt on my Plymouth
Through the glass behind my rear-view
Took a left when the world went right down 16th Avenue
Played with fire and I played on ledges
Every circus, stage, and county fair
I tried to file my points, sand my edges, and I just grew out my hair
I'm Mr. Misunderstood,        I'm Mr. Misunderstood
They're standing in line, chasing the buzz                                                     
Til the next big things and already was

Yeah, gives the head-scratchers fits
Wondering how in the hell they missed

Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke

the light reflects, the chain on your neck
 He says look up and your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch you felt enough
 You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out, you
You're in love, true love
You're in love
Morning, his place burn toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
And for once you let go, of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kissed on sidewalks, you fight and you talk
One night he wakes, strange look on his face
Pauses, then says, you're my best friend
And you knew what it was, he is in love
 You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out, you

And he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown
 And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
 And why I've spent my whole life try to put it into words

Go to work, do your best, don't outsmart your common sense
Never let your prayin' knees get lazy
And love like crazy
Always treat your woman like a lady
Never get to old to call her baby
Never let your prayin knees get lazy
And love like crazy
They called him crazy when they started out
They've been together fifty-eight years now
Aint that crazy

49,Rainbow (ver 3),Kacey Musgraves,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/kacey-musgraves/rainbow-chords-2356755,"When it rains it pours but you didn't even notice
It ain't rainin' anymore, it's hard to breathe when all you know is
The struggle of staying above, the rising water line
Well, the sky is finally opened, the rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same old storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella, but darlin' I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head
If you could see what I see, you'd be blinded by the colours
Yellow, red and orange and green, and at least a million others
So tie up the bow, take off your coat and take a look around
'Cause, the sky is finally opened, the rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same old storm again
You hold tight to your umbrella, but darlin' I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head
So tie up the bow, take off your coat and take a look around
Everything is alright now
'Cause, the sky is finally opened, the rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same old storm again
Let go of your umbrella, but darlin' I'm just tryin' to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head
Yeah, there's always been a rainbow hangin' over your head
It'll all be alright...

Or a weekend at the factory

And Saturdays, he spent with me

Said how’s the West coast

Next thing I know

And we danced to every song
Another one of those nights
Where we didn’t want to leave
Kissing like you never left
Got my heart back in a wreck
Spinning under those lights
Like a record on repeat
Right on time
In the groove
You and me
Like we didn’t miss a beat
If it was quiet or it was loud
A couple people or a crowd
Hell I couldn’t tell
We were lost in ourselves
Like the music never stopped
It was like the needle dropped
Right where we left off, left off

Ain't sat in the church that saved you

Do you think of February?
So in love it was scary
We were just two hearts
A cheap tent we bought at the Walmart
Or is it the kitchen
When we forgot how to listen?
At the end of July
On the edge of goodbye
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, when it's late at night
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, when I cross your mind
What do you think of when you think of me?
When you look back on us what do you see?
Is it the good times? Is it the bad times?
Is it somewhere in between?
What do you think of when you think of me?
When I see the smoky mountains
I get kinda sad thinking 'bout it
I still got the air brushed t-shirt we wore all weekend
Girl, did you keep it?
I can't even drive down 8th Avenue
'Cause the whole damn town reminds me of you
But to tell you the truth, I don't mind the reminders
They're all I have left of you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, when it's late at night
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, when I cross your mind (When I cross your mind)

Do you cry or laugh?

I was eatin' blackberries right off of the vine
But my wild blood, it took me so far away
And I left simpler times in the past where they'd stay
But I tell my own heart every place that I go

Each time I'd get clean, it'd just grow back again
I got strung out and locked up, but I came out alive
Did a life's worth of living in a short block of time
I can't say I'd like to go through it again
But I put down the spoon and I picked up the pen
Now I travel and sing with the love of my life
Proud to say I made that decision right
But I tell my own heart every place that I go
Someday we'll go back to where that old cool river flows

I've got dreams of coaching Little League
But I still feel like a kid
And I bet the day that I turn 83
I will still feel like a kid
 A fact I've spent my whole life battling
 'Til I learned to let it go
 That was back when I knew everything
 Just a few short years ago
And I'm dancing through a grocery store
Makes me still feel like a kid
I go three times 'round revolving doors
Makes me still feel like a kid
I hear the music from the ice cream man
Makes me still feel like a kid
I am the singer in a rock 'n roll band

If they tell me one more time to get in line, I'm gonna breakaway
But I'm sure that every single prison guard that walks around this prison yard
Is gonna have a shot at me if he sees me running for the gate
I'd be better off dead, full of lead, rather than delay one more day
Letting my mind and my body rot away in this awful place
I'd be floating way up so high looking down
I hope one day you can find the guts to escape”
Well, you might say, “How come you so sure heaven's where you're going?
You ain't exactly been showin' the ways of an angel, glory bound”
I must admit you got a point, but I got a feeling the ceiling ain't so far
And Yahweh just may want a couple words with yours truly
So I'll be walking right up to those big pearly gates, saying, “Hey Saint Peter, ol' Buddy, ol' pal
How's the family, how's work, how's the kids?
And lettin' a fine upstanding fellow like myself join the club?”
And he might say, “Ah, Mr. Avett you can save it, I ain't gonna be buying any of that lyin’, jive, hustlin'
Down there on Earth
And I'll say, “Come on, surely you and God of all people ought to know
Surrounded by nothing but grey and quiet”
Well dear God, maybe I should just be talking straight to you
The truth is I lost my way somewhere along the way
And if you got a minute would you spend it with a sinner?
Just long enough to give me some directions home

Possibilities overflow his unbroken heart
I ask him well after the brush takes the spark
What do you see in the fire?
I see light within color and color in light
Trophies I'll take home and battles I'll fight
A bright blue horizon with no pain in sight
I'll be there and so will my parents and you're invited too
A life-sentence inmate in orange prisoner clothes
Who's been told his whole life that's just how it goes
Who came out swinging from poverty row
Sits a bit close to the dangerous glow
What do ya see in the fire?
I see rich people laughin' with food on their plates
And neighborhood bullies imprinted with hate
Moms and dads screaming at each other insane
And hard grey redemption a little too late
And I see myself as I might've been
I’m handsome, and capable, and funny
A young woman in college entranced by the flames
Is pondering silent how perfectly strange
A girl could be called by so many names and not one be the one she was given
What do you see in the fire?
I see myself in the mirror, not pretty enough
And digital images reducing love
My roommate enslaved by expectations above
And then I see the face of my mother
A first-year preacher stands on his feet
His love for mankind is true and complete
While the frigid wind blows through the trees
I ask as he leans away from the heat
""What do you see in the fire?""
I see swirling confusion, question, and loss
And I know all about Christ and the cross
But I cannot explain the Holocaust
I stuttered when a young man asked me to
I just couldn’t find the words
A woman of ninety with wisdom in spades
Her mind still as sharp as her kitchen blades
I ask as her memory nonetheless fades
""What do you see in the fire?""
I see the touch of my husband who recently passed
Our hometown before the roads got so fast
And I see it now in an impatient blur
And I see how in love we were
I see the good Lord offering mercy
I see the good Lord offering mercy
I see the good Lord offering mercy
Someone I care for, she sits by my side
I can feel the past and the future collide
She leans in and whispers, “Don't think, just decide""
What do you see in the fire?
I see the faces of my victims whose hearts I once broke
Calm and alive in the curling smoke
All I can do is sit here and hope
They may find a way to forgive me
There's something unspoken there in your eyes
A pain or a love I don't recognize
I better ask you now before it dies
What do you see in the fire?

Thrown into the waves
Told to rise above the clouds to find the brighter days
I don't remember when it happened
But I remember how it felt
Something slipped away and I became somebody else
In the summer stars I see
Someone I used to be
Just a kid again
With the sky in my hands
Flying free
I gave up on El Dorado
So I started painting stones
Lived under a life so big I shrunk into my clothes
Talking to my shadow
Mumbling in the night
Covered up the windows 'cause the light it hurt my eyes
And in notebook twenty-three
There's a boy I used to be
Stuck in his head
Picking bugs from his bed
And dying to be free
Ejected from the jungle
Hallelujah peace at last
Once I got out of the woods I thought I never would look back
And I hate that it still lingers
And I hate that it's this hard
Longing for the very things that scare you in the dark
In the creaking door I hear
Those shadows reappear
And try to pull me in
But now I'm tied to the wind
And I'm blowing out of here
I want to be a preacher
I want to be a saint
I just came here with the word that you can learn from all the pain
Whatever maybe heaven
However you believe
Something circled in and pulled me out and I got clean

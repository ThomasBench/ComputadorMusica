I found out those bright lights aint where I belong
From a phone booth in the rain I called to tell her
I've had a change of dreams I'm comin' home
But tears filled my eyes when I found out she was gone
Smokey Mountain rain keeps on fallin'
I keep on callin' her name
Smokey Mountain rain I'll keep on searchin'
I can't go on hurtin' this way
She's somewhere in the Smokey Mountain rain
I waved a diesel down outside a cafe'
He said that he was goin' as far as Gatlinburg
I climbed up in the cab all wet and cold and lonely
I wiped my eyes and told him about her
I've got to find her!
Can you make these big wheels burn?
Smokey Mountain rain keeps on fallin'
I keep on callin' her name
Smokey Mountain rain I'll keep on searchin'
I can't go on hurtin' this way
She's somewhere in the Smokey Mountain rain
I can't blame her for lettin' go
A woman needs someone warm to hold
I feel the rain runnin' down my face
I'll find her no matter what it takes!
Smokey Mountain rain keeps on fallin'
I keep on callin' her name
Smokey Mountain rain I'll keep on searchin'
I can't go on hurtin' this way
Smokey Mountain rain keeps on fallin'
I keep on callin' her name
She's somewhere in the Smokey Mountain rain

I was 15 goin' on 20 when I met up with this old man
He was quite a lover of the cards and of the dice
He had whores and he had ladies, he made love and he made babies
He could tell some damn good stories and give some good advice
(chorus)You gotta learn how to pick 'em son, learn how to lick 'em son,
Learn how to stick 'em son between the thighs.
You gotta try not to beat 'em too much, try not to teach 'em too much,
Try not to feed 'em too much bullshit and lies.

  You see the moon and watch it rise
  Across the continent the night bird sings
  And somewhere someone hears its cry
  So disillusioned keep your head down
  and if you do they'll never know
  You'll have no answers to their questions
  And they will have to let you  go
  And disenfranchised revolution
  They'll take away by right what's yours
  And make you martyrs of your own cause
  When they don't know what cause it's for
  And all deserted stand  alerted
  They'll love you when you're all alone
  But you find a red rose in the morning light
  You wait the night and find it gone
  So hear my words with faith and passion
  For what I say to you is true
  And when you find the one you might become
  Remember art of me is you  Hum-hum Humm-huhum
  Remember part of me is you

6,Duvaliers Dream,Kris Kristofferson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/kris-kristofferson/duvaliers-dream-chords-1814854,"Duvalier was a bitter man who cursed the morning sun
That brought a new betrayal every day
He shunned the world of mortals and the sounds of human tongues
And blessed the night that chased their sight away
A disillusioned dreamer who would never love again
Who'd tried of it and found that it was rotten
Preferring perfect strangers to the company of friends
For strangers are so easily forgotten
Oh, it's hard to keep believing when you know you've been deceived
To face a lie and dare to try again, 
but there's nothing like a woman with a spell of make believe 
to make a new believer of a man
Duvalier took the fickle turns of fortune in his stride
Expecting next to nothing out of life
Till fortune found a girl who fanned a flame he thought had died
Whose burning beauty cut him like a knife
She touched him through the senses that his mind could not control
Then smiling stepped aside and watched him fall
Betrayed by his own body and the hunger in his soul
Duvalier was a dreamer after all
Oh, it's hard to keep believing when you know you've been deceived
To face a lie and dare to try again, 
but there's nothing like a woman with a spell of make believe 
to make a new believer of a man

so won't you keep this heart from breaking if it's only for a very short time

but why is everybody telling everybody what you have done
Baby, I know it makes you sad

So hide your heart beneath the covers and tell 'em they're the only one

Find safe harbour on our shores.

I skied on crystal pathways to a mountain peak so tall,
and I walked the mighty summits with the one who made it all.

And I've walked her wild and rugged paths through her open wilderness.

I got this funny feeling deep inside
So I leaned over and I kissed her
I put my arms around her and then
Well she reached out and she slapped me
She said, ""You're just like all the other men""
Son you're talking to the wrong man
If you wanna know what girls are all about
You're talking to the wrong man
Still ain't got your mama figured out
By the way son, I've got a problem
I wonder could you talk with me a while
You see lately your mama she ignores me
Hardly ever gives me a little smile
So I was thinkin' maybe you could show me
The way you younger fellas comb your hair
Think I need to change my style son
Could you show me something really cool to wear?
Dad you're talking to the wrong man
If you wanna know what girls are all about
You're talking to the wrong man
Still ain't got my girlfriend figured out
So I guess we'll just go fishin'
Or maybe head out to that old gold course today
When our buddies ask us about women
I think I know exactly what we'll say
Boys you're talking to the wrong man
If you wanna know what girls are all about
You're talking to the wrong man

My love is edged in granite harder than gold
Bigger than a mountain and  twice as old
And if hell freezes over we'll be cool
Cause I'll still be lovin' you
If the winds stop blowing and the sun won't shine
It won't change the feelings in this heart of mine
If the world disappears into space
There's nothing left of a human race
I don't care what it's coming to
I'll still be lovin' you
My love is edged in granite harder than gold
Bigger than a mountain and  twice as old
And if hell freezes over   we'll be cool
Cause I'll still be lovin' you
I'll still be lovin' you
I'll still be lovin' you
Oh I'll still be lovin' you

46,You Lift Me Up To Heaven,Reba McEntire,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/reba-mcentire/you-lift-me-up-to-heaven-chords-1808951,"Been to Colorado where the mountains touch the sky
And I've done other things in life to lift my spirits high
But nothing that I've ever tried to do
Has taken me as high as loving you
'Cause you lift me up, up, up, up to heaven
When you gently lay me down____
You lift me up, up, up, up to heaven
Yes, you make my world go 'round
I never try to get away on daydreams anymore
Love's taken me to places that I've never been before
But if it's not heaven when you're holding me
It's the way that heaven oughta be
'Cause you lift me up, up, up, up to heaven
When you gently lay me down____
You lift me up, up, up, up to heaven
Yes, you make my world go 'round____
And we never leave the ground
up, up, up, up to heaven
Yes, you make my world go 'round

Fairweather friends, fairweather sai - lors,
Theyâll leave you strand - ed on life's shore.
One good friend who truly loves you
Is worth the pain your heart en - dures.
We never know which way the wind will blow,
Nor when or where the next turmoil will be.
But he's a solid rock when troubles grow,
And he's holding out a saving hand for me.
Fairweather friends, fairweather sai - lors,
Theyâll leave you strand - ed on life's shore.
One good friend who truly loves you
Is worth the pain your heart en - dures.
Fairweather friends, fairweather sai - lors,
Theyâll leave you strand - ed on life's shore.
One good friend who truly loves you
Is worth the pain your heart en - dures.
He'll be a refuge in the storm;
He'll be a beacon in the night;
In the chilly winds of doubt he'll keep you warm;
When you can't find your way he'll be your light.
Fairweather friends, fairweather sai - lors,
Theyâll leave you strand - ed on life's shore.
One good friend who truly loves you
Is worth the pain your heart en - dures.

And oh oh oh I'm trying not to
No no no I don't wanna love you
But oh oh oh I think I do
This heart of mine   it's been mistreated
Love's done me wrong   time and again
After the way I've been cheated
I want you and yet I still can't forget
I'm so afraid to give in
No no no I don't wanna love you
And oh oh oh I'm trying not to
No no no I don't wanna love you
But oh oh oh I think I do
I think about you  o-h every minute
And I miss you when you're not around
And every day I'm getting deeper in it
I'm scared to go on but the feelings so strong
I can't turn away from you now
No no no I don't wanna love you
And oh oh oh I'm trying not to
No no no I don't wanna love you
But oh oh oh I think I do

I see all the colours pass me by
I sure like the things my eyes can do
Especially when they see you
I hear the music of this day
I sure like the songs this world can play
But most of all I like your tune
When you whisper I love you
My sences don?t lie I get a definite high
When you?re near I feel clear off the ground
Reach for my arms and I will give you the stars
There is nothing that?s holding us down
I touch the textures of this earth
I fell for the good and I fell for the worst
But I never knew what touch could do
Untill I was touched by you
My sences don?t lie I get a definite high
When you?re near I feel clear off the ground
Reach for my arms and I will give you the stars
There is nothing that?s holding us down
I see the rainbow in your eyes
I see all the colours pass me by
I sure like the things my eyes can do
Especially when they see you

0,Rockin Chair,Jerry Jeff Walker,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jerry-jeff-walker/rockin-chair-chords-1831248,"There's an old rockin' chair spreading memories everywhere
On that old home porch across from Tipple's store.
You can see where the wood is worn, where my granddaddy rested his arm
As he rocked me in that rockin' chair that don't rock no more.
I was born in a broken home, I was blinded by things gone wrong.
Had no vision of what the future held in store.
Just a baby barely three, when my granddaddy came for me
To rock me in the rockin' chair that don't rock no more.
If that old rockin' chair could read, the thoughts from people's mind
Oh the stories it could tell time after time.
Stories others never hear, of the thoughts one holds so dear.
Oh how I wish I coulda read my grandpa's mind.
Granddaddy lived the Christian way, truth and goodness he portrayed.
He loved to gather his thoughts as he rocked on the hardwood floor
And while he’s sit and rock, he paid no mind to the time on the clock.
And rocked me in the rockin' chair that don't rock no more.
If that old rockin' chair could read, the thoughts from people's mind
Oh the stories it could tell time after time.
Stories others never hear, of the thoughts one holds so dear.
Oh how I wish I coulda read my grandpa's mind.
As he rocked me in the rockin' chair that don't rock no more, don’t rock no more.

1,Put Your Hand In The Hand (ver 2),Anne Murray,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/anne-murray/put-your-hand-in-the-hand-chords-1844855,"Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the waters
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself and you can look at the others differently
By putting your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee
Every time I look into the Holy book i want to tremble
When I read about the part where a carpenter cleared the temple
For the buyers and the sellers were no different 
Fellers than what I profess to be
And it causes me shame to know I'm not the gal that I should be
Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the waters
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself and you can look at the others differently
By putting your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee
Mama taught me how to pray before I reached the age of seven
And when I'm down on my knees that's when I'm close to heaven
Daddy lived his life for eight kids and wife you do what you must do
But he showed me enough of what it takes to get you through
Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the waters
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself and you can look at the others differently
By putting your hand in the hand of the man from Galilee

And I'm in no mood for to hear your sad song 
Bring not your light into my dark room yellow sunshine
Waste not your warmth on the cold glisten here 
Oh trouble me not go ye elsewhere
Go light your blue sky and I'll shed my blue tears 
For the only one that I have ever loved has gone away 
And I'm in no mood for the sunshine today 
Cause I don't know when or if ever again
I will see his sweet face but I fear
It's forever goodbye though I can't say why

On a summer afternoon 
In a straightback chair on two legs 
Leaned against the wall 
With June bugs on a string 
And chase the glowin fire flies 
when evenin shadows fall 
In my Tennessee mountain home 
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh 
In my Tennessee mountain home 
Crickets sing in the fields near by 
Honeysuckle vine clings 
To the fence along the lane 
Their fragrance makes the summer wind so sweet 
An eagle spreads its wings 
And a songbird on a fence post 
Sings a melody 
In my Tennessee mountain home 
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh 
In my Tennessee mountain home 
Crickets sing in the fields near by
Walkin home from church on Sunday 
With the one ya love 
Just laughin talkin 
Makin future plans 
You might steal a kiss or two 
Sittin in the porch swing holdin hands 
In my Tennessee mountain home 
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh 
In my Tennessee mountain home 
Crickets sing in the fields near by

stared into the sun 
and relived the days of living by the gun 
when deadly games of pride were played 
and living was mistakes not made 
and the thought of the smell of the black powder smoke 
and the stand in the street at the turn of a joke 
Ah, the smell of the black powder smoke 
and the stand in the street at the turn of a joke 
It's always keep your back to the sun 
and he can almost feel the weight of the gun 
it's faster than snakes or the blink of an eye 
and it's a time for all slow men to die 
and his eyes get squinty and his fingers twitch 
and he empties the gun at the son of a bitch 
and he's hit by the smell of the black powder smoke 
and the stand in the street at the turn of a joke 
hit by the smell of the black powder smoke 
and the stand in the street at the turn of a joke 
Now the burn of a bullet is only a scar 
he's back in his chair in front of the bar 
and the streets are empty and the blood's all dried 
and the dead are dust and the whiskey's inside 
so buy him a drink and lend him an ear 
he's nobody's fool and the only one here 
who remembers the smell of the black powder smoke 
and the stand in the street at the turn of a joke 
remember the smell of the black powder smoke 
and the stand in the street at the turn of a joke 
He said I stood in that street before it was paved 
learned shoot or be shot before I could shave 
and I did it all for the money and fame 
noble was nothing but feeling no shame 
and nothing was sacred 'sept stayin' alive 
and all that I learned from a Colt 45 
was to curse the smell of the black powder smoke 
and the stand in the street at the turn of a joke 
curse the smell of the black powder smoke 
and the stand in the street at the turn of a joke 
Now he's just an old man that no one believes 
says he's a gunfighter, the last of the breed 
and there are ghosts in the street seeking revenge 
calling him out to the lunatic fringe 
now he's out in the traffic checking the sun 
and he's killed by a car as he goes for his gun 
So much for the smell of the black powder smoke 
and the stand in the street at the turn of a joke

	On my way down to the river
	Waiting patient by the chant of every tree
	With her feet already dusty
	From the pathway to the levi
	And her little blue jeans rolled up to her knees
	I'd pay her no attention
	Trying hard to copy everything i did
	But i couldn't keep from smiling
	When i hear somebody saying
	Lucky under there goes Jody and the kid
	Even after we grew older
	As we walked along the levi holding hands
	And i lived enough to call myself a man
	And she often lay beside me
	Til' the morning sun was shining on my bed
	And on times when she was sleeping
	I would smile and i'd remember
	How they use to call us Jody and the kid
	Now the words are a little older
	Cause now they're houses where they didn't used to be
	And on Sundays i go walking
	Down the pathway to the levi
	With another little girl who follows me
	And it makes the ole folks smile
	Doing little things the way her mama did

got some good advice to give you, lots of things you oughta know.
Take a tip from one who's travelled and never stopped a-ramblin' 'round
'cause once you get the roamin' fever, you never want to settle down, boy,
you never want to settle down.
I met a little gal in Frisco and I asked her to be my wife,
told her I was tired of roamin', goin' to settle down for life.
Then I heard the whistle blowin' and I knew it was the Red Ball Train
and I left that gal beside the railroad and never saw that gal again, boy,
I never saw that gal again.
  Saw that gal again, I never saw that gal again,
left that gal beside the railroad, I never saw that gal again.
Travelled all over the country, I've travelled everywhere,
been on every branch line railroad, I never paid a nickel fare.
I been from Maine to Californy, from Canada to Mexico,
and I never tried to save no money and now I got no place to go, boy,
now I got no place to go.
Listen to a boomer's story, pay attention to what I say:
I hear another train a-comin', guess I'll be on my way.
If you wanna do me a favor when I lay me down and die:
just dig my grave beside the railroad, so I can hear the trains go by, boys,
so I can hear the trains go by.
  Hear the trains go, I can hear the trains go by,
just dig my grave beside the railroad, so I can hear the trains go by.

Back to the seasons of my youth 
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us 
And how my mamma put those rags to use 
There were rags of many colors, and every piece was small 
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall 
Mamma sewed the rags together, sewing every piece with love 
She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of 
As she sewed she told the story from the Bible she had read 
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said 
Perhaps this coat will bring you much love and happiness 
And I just couldn't wait to wear it 
And mamma blessed it with a kiss 
My coat of many colors that my mamma made for me 
Made only from rags, but I wore it so proudly 
Although we had no money, oh I was rich as I could be 
In my coat of many colors, my mamma made for me 
So with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes 
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school 
Just to find the others laughing and makin' fun of me 
In my coat of many colors, my mamma made for me 
And I told them of the love my mamma sewed in every stitch 
And I told them all the story mamma told me while she sewed 
And how my coat of many colors 
was worth more than all their clothes 
But they didn't understand it and I tried to make them see 
That one is only poor only if they choose to be 
Now I know we had no money, but I was rich as I could be 
In my coat of many colors, my mamma made for me 
Made just for me...

He'd never stood one single time to prove the county wrong.
His mama named him Tommy, but folks just called him yellow,
Something always told me they were reading Tommy wrong.
He was only ten years old when his daddy died in prison;
I took care of Tommy, 'cause he was my brother's son.
I still recall the final words my brother said to Tommy,
""Son my life is over, but yours has just begun"".
""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can.
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand,
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man.""
There's someone for everyone, and Tommy's love was Becky.
In her arms he didn't have to prove he was a man.
One day while he was working, the Gatlin boys came calling
They took turns at Becky, (n' there was three of them).
Tommy opened up the door, and saw Becky crying.
The torn dress, the shattered look was more than he could stand.
He reached above the fireplace, and took down his daddy's picture.
As the tears fell on his daddy's face, he heard these words again:
""Promise me, son, not to do the things I've done
Walk away from trouble if you can.
It won't mean you're weak if you turn the other cheek
I hope you're old enough to understand,
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man.""
The Gatlin boys just laughed at him when he walked into the barroom;
One of them got up and met him half way cross the floor.
When Tommy turned around they said, ""Hey look! old yeller's leaving,""
But you could've heard a pin drop when Tommy stopped and locked the door.
Twenty years of crawling were bottled up inside him.
He wasn't holding nothing back - he let 'em have it all.
When Tommy left the bar room, not a Gatlin boy was standing.
He said, ""This one's for Becky, as he watched the last one fall. (And I heard him say,)
""I promised you, Dad, not to do the things you've done
I walk away from trouble when I can
Now please don't think I'm weak, I didn't turn the other cheek,
And papa, I should hope you understand

Seems like total silence is the only friend I have  
A bowl of oatmeal tried to stare me down... and won  
And it was twelve o'clock before I realized that I was havin' no fun  
Ah, but fortunately I have the key to escape reality

Won't you please tell the man I didn't kill anyone  
No I'm just tryin' to have me some fun
Last time I checked my bankroll, well it was gettin' thin 
Sometimes it seems like the bottom is the only place I've been 
Chased a rainbow down a one-way street... dead end  
And all my friends turned out to be insurance salesmen 
Ah, but fortunately I have the key to escape reality  
And you may see me tonight with an illegal smile  
It don't cost very much, but it lasts a long while  
Won't you please tell the man I didn't kill anyone

I sat down in my closet with all my overalls  
Just tryin' to get away from all the years inside these walls  
Dreamed the police heard everything I thought... what then? 
Well I went to court and the judge's name was Hoffman 
Ah, but fortunately I have the key to escape reality

45,Dont Come Home A Drinkin,Loretta Lynn,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/loretta-lynn/dont-come-home-a-drinkin-chords-1989497,"Well you thought I'd be waitin' up when you came home last night
You'd been out with all the boys and you ended up half tight
But liquor and love they just don't mix leave the bottle or me behind
And don't come home a drinkin' with lovin' on your mind
No don't come home a drinkin' with lovin' on your mind
Just stay out there on the town and see what you can find
Cause if you want that kind of love well you don't need none of mine
So don't come home a drinkin' with lovin' on your mind
You never take me anywhere because you're always gone
And many a night I've laid awake and cried here all alone
Then you come in a kissin' on me it happens every time
No don't come home a drinkin' with lovin' on your mind
No don't come home a drinkin' with lovin' on your mind
Just stay out there on the town and see what you can find
Cause if you want that kind of love well you don't need none of mine
So don't come home a drinkin' with lovin' on your mind
So don't come home a drinkin' with lovin' on your mind

We're gonna do what they say can't be done
We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
I'm west bound, just watch ol' Bandit run
Keep your foot hard on the pedal, Son nevermind them brakes
Let it all hang out cause we got a run to make
The boys are thirsty in Atlanta, and there's beer in Texarcana
And we'll bring it back no matter what it takes
West bound and down, eighteen wheels arollin',
We're gonna do what they say can't be done
We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
I'm west bound, just watch ol' Bandit run
West bound and down, eighteen wheels arollin',
We're gonna do what they say can't be done
We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
I'm west bound, just watch ol' Bandit run
Ol' Smokey's got them ears on and he's hot on your trail
He aint gonna rest 'til you're in jail
You got to keep that diesel truckin'
Just put that hammer down and give it hell
West bound and down, eighteen wheels arollin'
We're gonna do what they say can't be done
We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
I'm west bound, just watch ol' Bandit run

About the noise comin' from this old house and me
Lord, but this feelin' takes hold of me
God knows I fight it, but it takes con- trol of me
That's why I'm here tonight in memory of a memory
See that back yard that's where my babies used to play
And see that window, hey, that's the bedroom where we used to lay
Oh, sure you think I'm crazy and hell I just might be
But as for to- night, I'm here in memory of a memory
So go back to sleep and don't worry about me
Out here in this night air all alone
Yeah, I'll be leavin' soon, soon as I check each room
Cause it's still my home, yes, still my home
Guess I'll go water the flowers like she asked me to
I wish I'd done, it way back then like she asked me to
Lord, but this bottle took hold of me
God knows I fought it, but it took control of me
That's why I'm here tonight in memory of a memory

Behind the water wheel
And I got no place to go
Tumble down
Rumble bound
Cause I got no place to go
Got no home
Got no place to go
So the rain(falsetto)**
May come again
It's the same
Old refrain
What's your name?
Please explain
Have you got no place to go?
All alone
Got no home
I Got no place to go
Stumble on
Sing a along

May come again

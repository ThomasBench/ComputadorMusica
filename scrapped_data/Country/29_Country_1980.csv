I got to let it go
Put on my weekend clothes
turn on the rock 'n' roll
Throw all my cares away
Its a ragtop day
Cruise across the county line
A drive in picture show
And when the midnight's comin down
She lets her lovin show

And I can just see ya ridin' in a rodeo
You might even make it down to Texas
Or you might head out west to New Mexico
So pack up all of your belongings
A pick-up will take you where you wanna go
You can ride out when you hear mountains calling
Out to Canada or the canyons of Colorado
New York City was always your home
But in your heart you know you were born to roam
And you're gonna leave as soon as you get the money
After you sell everything you own
Maria, is loneliness a virtue
Or does it steal you blind and leave you split apart
Maria, can you give me an answer
Are the songs we sing worth the broken heart
The highway has always been your lover
And someday you may know his name
Wherever you stay it wouldn't really matter
'Cause all those cities start to look the same
Some folks will try to take your heart away
And just when you think you've really got it made
You wake up and find madness in the morning
But damn the pain and damn those restless days
Damn the pain and damn those restless days

When the waiter came up and said what do you want
I looked at the menu and it looked so nice
Till he said lemme give you some advice.
He said spaghetti and potatoes got too much starch
Pork chops and sausage are bad for your heart
There's hormones in chicken and beef and veal
Bowl of ravioli is a dead man's meal.
Bread's got preservatives there's nitrites in ham
Artificial coloring in jellies and jam
Stay away from donuts run away from pie
Pepperoni pizza is a sure way to die.
Sugar rots your teeth and makes you put on weight
But artificial sweetener's got cyclamates
Eggs got cholesterol, there's fat in cheese
Coffee ruins your kidneys and so does tea.
Fish got mercury, red meat is poison
Salt's gonna send your blood pressure risin'
Hot dogs and bologna got deadly red dyes
Vegetables and fruits are sprayed with pesticides.
So I said what can I eat that's gonna make me last
He said a small drink of water in a sterilized glass
And then he stopped and he thought for a minute
And said never mind the water, there's carcinogenics in it.
So I got up from the table and walked out in the street
Realizin' there was nothin' I could eat
I ain't eaten for a month and I'm feeling fine
'Cause he did not mention beer, whiskey, women and sweet red wine...

You gotta figure on a master plan
You couldn't do it, if you don't get ready
You'll be beaten by the other man
Do you wanna be the last one in
Play the game that you just don't win

Make you mine for another day
Ain't nobody doesn't need anybody
When the good times turn away
I don't wanna be the lonely one
Fade away in the evenin' sun
I could love you all of my life
You are my wife, haven't I told you so

In autumn forever the fool come a-fallin'
And the rain turned to freezing inside of me

And the roads I can't follow and the songs I can't sing
I'll wander alone on the sleighbells of winter
With the stars for a diamond and the world for a ring
Well all you young ladies who dream of tomorrow
While you're listening these words will I say:
Cling to today with its joy and its sorrow
You'll need all your memories when youth melts away
The angel of springtime he rides down the south wind
The angel of summer, he does just the same
The angel of autumn, she's blue and she's golden
And the angel of winter won't remember your name

And the oldest friend I've got I met today
The woman that I love just up and left me
And the place I love a thousand miles away
Operator hook me up to Houston
Get me anybody on the phone
Look there in your book and pick a number
Cause you can't be choosy when you're this alone
Won't you talk to me Texas let me hear that draw
I spent my last five dollars on this one long distance call
Won't you talk to me Texas I got these homesick blues
Tell me I can come on home to you
I got this faded number in my wallet
It's been in here a dozen years I know
I used to call it up when I was lonely
Lord that women sure could love me so
I know by now she's probably changed her number
And with my luck she's probably changed her name
If there's a chance in hell I think I'll take it
Cause I'd love to hear that woman's voice again
Hey tell me I can come on home to you

48,Turn This Thing Around,Keith Whitley,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/keith-whitley/turn-this-thing-around-chords-4122769,"Well one thing led to another that led to your taxi cab
I said take me to the airport man I was really mad
Angry words were spoken mostly out of spite
Now this second thought I'm havin' is the first thing I've done right
Turn this thing around you must think I've lost my mind
But I really would be crazy to leave her love behind
Temporarily insane but I see so clearly now
So if you don't mind take me back so I can turn this thing around
Saw a little man sellin' roses just back a couple of blocks
I'll roll down the window and buy all that he's got
And if you know a shortcut or run a light or two
When you pull in my driveway there's a twenty just for you
Turn this thing around you must think I've lost my mind
But I really would be crazy to leave her love behind
Temporarily insane but I see so clearly now
So if you don't mind take me back so I can turn this thing around
Temporarily insane but I see so clearly now
So if you don't mind take me back so I can turn this thing around
So if you don't mind take me back so I can turn this thing around

Mother Freedom, Father Time,
Since she left me by myself,
You're the only family I got left
I still go to that same old cafe
and I try to wash my troubles away
but I'm still down
and I'm still all alone
but, it beats staying home all night long
Brother Jukebox, Sister Wine,
Mother Freedom, Father Time,
Since she left me by myself,
You're the only family I got left
I go home, lord I climb that old stairway,
and I tell myself, tomorrow's a new day
but I know
I'll just go down again
And spend my time with my new next up kin
Brother Jukebox, Sister Wine,
Mother Freedom, Father Time,
Since she left me by myself,
You're the only family I got left
oh, you're the only family
I got left

I'll do my crying in the rain

Could never wash away my misery
But since we're not together
I look for stormy weather
To hide these tears I hope you'll never see
Someday when my cryin's done
I'm gonna wear a smile and walk in the sun
I may be a fool but till then darling you'll
Never see me complain

And soon the snow
Would turn the skies to winter.
She said she'd come to look for work
She was not seekin' favors
And for a dime a day
And a place to stay
She'd turn those hands to labor
The times were hard Lord, and the jobs were few
All through Tecumseh Valley
But she asked around
And a job she found
Tending bar at Gypsy Sally's
She saved enough to get back home
When spring replaced the winter
But her dreams were denied
Her pa  had  died
The word come down from Spencer.
So she turned to whorin' out on the streets
With all the lust inside her
And it was many a man
Who returned  again
To lay himself beside her.
They found her down beneath the stairs
That led to Gypsy Sally's
And in her hand when she died
Was a note that cried
Fare-thee-well, Tecumseh Valley

The daughter of a miner

But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a-gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer
I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile
And he said ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help you along
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong""

And I know you hate me, and you got the right

For the gravel in yer guts and the spit in ya eye
Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you 'Sue'""

And there's no such thing as Doctor Seuss
or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme
God didn't make little green apples

I think about her face aglow and ease my mind
Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy
and ask her if she could get away and meet me
and maybe we could grab a bite to eat
And she drops what she's doin' and she hurries down to meet me
and I'm always late
But she sits waitin' patiently and smiles when she first sees me
'cause she's made that way
And if that's not lovin' me
then all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples
and it don't snow in Minneapolis when the winter comes
And there's no such thing as make believe,
puppy dogs, autumn leaves and BB guns
God didn't make little green apples

I came out in second place.

I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
the way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame 
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned 
I always built alas on weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day 
and only now I see how the years ran away 
Yesterday when I was young 
so many drinking songs were waiting to be sung, 
so many wayward pleasures lay in store for me 
and so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see 
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out 
I never stopped to think what life was all about 
and every conversation I can now recall 
concerned itself with me and nothing else at all 
Yesterday the moon was blue 
and every crazy day brought something new to do 
I used my magic age as if it were a wand 
and never saw the waste and emptiness beyond 
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride 
and every flame I lit too quickly quickly died
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away 
and only I am left on stage to end the play
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung 
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue 
The time has come for me to pay for yesterday when I was young

And speaks to me of flowers that will bloom again in spring.

And anything that it would tell me, that's the thing that I would do.
But now I feel such emptiness within,
For the thing that I want most in life's the thing that I can't win.
Spread your tiny wings and fly away,
And take the snow back with you where it came from on that day.
The one I love forever is untrue,
And if I could you know that I would fly away with you.
The breeze along the river seems to say,
That he'll only break my heart again should I decide to stay.
So, little snowbird, take me with you when you go
To that land of gentle breezes where the peaceful waters flow.
Spread your tiny wings and fly away,
And take the snow back with you where it came from on that day.

And I turned twenty-one in pris-on do-in life with-out
pa-role, No one could steer me right but Ma-ma tried,
Mama tried. Ma-ma tried to raise me bet-ter,  but her
plead-ing I de-nied, That leaves only me to blame,
cause Ma-ma tried.
Dear ol' Dad-dy, rest his soul,
left my mom a heav-y load,
She tried so very hard to fill his shoes,
Work-in hou-rs with-out rest,
Want-ed me to have the best,
She tried to raise me right but I re-fused
And I turned twenty-one in prison do-in life with-out
pa-role, No one could steer me right but Ma-ma tried,
Mama tried. Ma-ma tried to raise me bet-ter,  but her
plead-ing I de-nied,
That leaves only me to blame cause Ma-ma tried..

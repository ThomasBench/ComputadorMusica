A man just cant understand
Sometimes all it takes to please her
Is the touch of your hand
N' Other times you got to take it slow
And hold her all night long
Heaven knows there's so many ways
A man can go wrong
Must be doin' somethin' right
I just heard ya sigh
N' Lean into my kiss
And close those deep blue need to eyes
Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this
But baby I must be doin' somethin' right
Anywhere you wanna go
Baby show me the way
I'm open to suggestions
Mmm whatever you say
Tonight's about givin' you what you want
Whatever it takes
Girl I hope i'm on the right road
Judgin by the smile on your face
Must be doin' somethin' right
I just heard ya sigh
N' Lean into my kiss
And close those deep blue need to eyes
Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this
But baby I must be doin' somethin'
Must be doin' somethin' right
I just heard ya sigh
N' Lean into my kiss
And close those deep blue need to eyes
Don't know what I did
To earn a love like this
But baby I must be doin' somethin' right

Coming from the joy that His love can bring

It's been my longest night i can tell
By the way i'm not surprised
To see the desert cover over paradise
Now count every rhododendron in this cool mountain light
I made more mistakes than that just tonight
So all of you folks in heaven not too busy ringing the bell
Some of us down here ain't doing very well
Some of us with our windows open in the southern cross motel
Still waitin
Still waitin
For you to sing that song again
The one you were singin at the very fall of man
It ain't hallelujah but it might as well have been
Sing it brother one more time
Sing it brother one more time
Sing it sister one more time
Sing it sister one more time

I've been going to bed early and getting up late
I look out my window and it's one shade of gray
Oh, my wife and my kids don't have much to say
A man out of work only gets in the way
Oh, the river is rising now, one inch an hour
And tonight we'll be lucky if we still have power
But I got a flashlight, an oil lamp and I'm ready to go
And a fresh set of batteries for my son's radio
If the dam really breaks, least we'll know where to go
River take me,    river take me
River take me far from trouble time
River take me,    river take me
River take me far from trouble tiiiiiime
Ohhhhhh    Ohhhhhhhhhhhh
If I had a boat you know what I'd do?
I'd float me and my family down to Baton Rouge
I wouldn't work in no factory, I'd live off the land
And live within means of my own two hands
Dance Saturday nights to a Zydeco band
Oh, the river flows and a young man dreams
And the river can drown you or it can wash you clean
It can take you away to some far away place
It can power your cities, carry your waste
And give all that you drink a peculiar taste
Oh, don't look to me, I've done my time
You see I've had too many dreams for this one heart of mine
And I've stood on the bridge with the river below
Feeling all of the sadness that a proud man could hold
Oh, the river is full but there's no way to go
River take me,    river take me
River take me far from trouble time
River take me,    river take me
River take me far from trouble time
River take me,    river take me

Watch that big light shine this way
Lord, it's been an awful day
I watched him leave that Friday morning
It was in the month of May
But return again some day
He was returned just one year later
But, I'll not forget that day
In a casket where he lay
Train man, keep your whistle blowing
Make it moan and make it whine
You make a man feel mighty lonesome
With a memory like mine....
In a little country graveyard
On a dark and dreary day
And the casket in the grave
I couldn't stand it any longer
And I knew not what to pray
All alone beneath that clay""

I can hear him call my name
And see him rising from the flames
Lord, if I could I'd trade places
I would gladly give my all
And listen for the clods to fall
Train man, keep your whistle blowing
Make it moan and make it whine
You make a man feel mighty lonesome

I wanna good steed under me like my forefathers before
I wanna good mount when the bugle sounds and I hear the cannons' roar
I wanna be in the cavalry if they send me off to war
well,I wanna horse in the volunteer force that's riding forth at dawn
Please save for me some gallantry that will echo when I'm gone
I beg of you sarge let me lead the charge when the battle lines are drawn
Lemme at least leave a good hoof beat they'll remember loud and long
I'd not a good foot soldier make, I'd be sour and slow at march
And I'd be sick on a navy ship, and the sea would leave me parched
But I'll be first in line if they'll let me ride, by god, you'll see my starch
Lope back o'er the heath with the laurel wreath underneath that vict’ry arch
Let me earn my spurs in the battle's blur where the day is lost or won
I'll wield my lance as the ponies dance and the blackguards fire their guns
A sabre keen, and a saddle carbine and an army Remington
Where the hot lead screams with the cold, cold steel let me be a cavalryman
Let 'em play their flutes and stirrup my boots and place them back to front
Cause I won’t be back on the rider-less black and I'm finished in my hunt
I wanna be in the cavalry if they send me off to war
I wanna be in the cavalry, but I won't ride home no more

With a suitcase full of dreams,
And a brand new spendin' dime
I had a full bouquet of music, wrapped in pretty words
Singin' songs sent down from heaven,
On the wings of a speckled bird
Wings of a speckled bird
I heard a guitar and a fiddle, banjo and mandolin
An old man opened up the door and told me ""come on in""
He took my ticket, then he told me,
Bring what it is you do
'Cause that's how you'll be remembered
When you're travelin' days are through
When you're travelin' days are through
They came from the hills and mountains,
The valleys and the plains
Some were kind and gentle,
And some too wild to tame
A string of fearless hearts, on an endless ball of twine
It's the same old train, it's 
just a different time
Just a different time
We sung songs in war, we sung songs in peace
We traveled in abundance and we traveled on relief
From the outer gates of heaven, to hell fire's burnin' door
It don't matter where you take it,
'Cause it's been there before
It's been there before
They came from the hills and mountains,
The valleys and the plains
Some were kind and gentle,
And some too wild to tame
A string of fearless hearts, on an endless ball of twine
It's the same old train, it's 
just a different time
Just a different time
Now like a precious treasure, that's immeasurable in worth
We stand before a new wave, proud children of the earth
We'll go on forever, and here's your solid proof
As long as there's a world we've gotta 
Sing Those folks the truth
Sing those folks the truth
They came from the neon cities,
The suburbs and the towns
From Bakersfield to Baltimore,
It's sacred holy ground
A string of fearless hearts, on an endless ball of twine
It's the same old train, it's
just a different time
Just a different time
Just a different time
Just a different time

And never really had a chance

About you and me

Whistle blowing love instead

Take the que from the strangest thing
Rolling fog into my room

And I just want to wish you well

With a heavy heart and my hat clutched in my hand
Such a foolish man God ain't known no greater sinner
I have come in search of Jesus hoping He will understand
If I give my soul will He clean these clothes I'm wearing
If I give my soul will He put new boots on my feet
If I bow my head and beg God for His forgiveness
Will He breathe new life within me and bring her back to me
I had a woman once she was kind and she was gentle
Had a child by me who grew up to be a man
I had a steady job till I started into drinking
Then I started making music traveling with the devil's band
Oh the years went by like a mighty rush of eagles
Our dreams and plans were all scattered in the wind
And it's a lonesome life when you lose the ones you live for
If I make my peace with Jesus will they take me back again
If I give my soul will He stop my hands from shaking
If I give my soul will my son love me again
If I give my soul and she knows I really mean it
If I give my soul to Jesus will she take me back again

It's the morning of your very first day
And you say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
       Fifteen
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be out Of here as soo as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And your mama's waitin up and your thinkin he's the one
And your dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them 
When you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at        fifteen

Nobody knows it but I am so sad
And that is the saddest of all my girl
That is the saddest of all
We climbed the ladder to the top of my house
Never letting go of your hand
The sky trades the moon for the sun my girl
The sky trades the moon for the sun
And I gave to you my ugly brown coat
You made it pretty when you put it on
Warmth in the early morning chill my girl
Warmth in the early April
Then you said you’d trade the love of a man
Tears fell soft from your face to my hands
Said you’d trade your heart for mine my girl
I traded my heart for those days
And you made it clear it was strictly a deal
Of springtime love and that’s how I should feel
So I set the clock back an hour my girl
I set the time a just right
You see somewhere back there when I was boy
Furious I had become by the point
That men are just liars and thieves of sorts
Men are just liars and thieves
But I still believe and I stand by my words
I don’t know what you have seen or you’ve heard
But somebody’s lying to you my girl
Somebody’s lying to you
You really made me believe I could stay
Part with you actions in part what you said
But that was just foolish pride my girl
And those are only feelings inside
So I’m going back to the place where we met
I’m going to find the beer bottle we left
Wedged in the limbs of the tree that we sat in
Wedged in the magnolia tree
Well we hid for days like a proud pair of thieves
Too sure we were right too stubborn too leave
Wasted with the moment we lifted my girl
Stolen forever with you

You don't know how lucky you are
You shouldn't spend your whole life wishin'
For something bound to fall apart
Every time you're feeling empty
Better thank your lucky stars
If you ever felt one breakin'
You'd never want a heart
Ohh, ohh, oh 
Hey there, Mr. Tin Man
You don't know how lucky you are
I've been on the road that you're on
It didn't get me very far
You ain't missin' nothin'
'Cause love is so damn hard
Take it from me darlin', you don't want a heart
Ohh, ohh, oh 
Ohh, ohh, oh 
Hey there, Mr. Tin Man
Glad we talked this out
You can take mine if you want it
It's in pieces now
By the way there, Mr. Tin Man
If you don't mind the scars
You give me your armor
And you can have my heart
Ohh, ohh, oh 
Ohh, ohh, oh 
Ohh, ohh, oh 
Ohh, ohh, oh

1,How Country Feels,Randy Houser,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/randy-houser/how-country-feels-chords-1153410,"You were raised on an asphalt farm 
Ain't never heard a rooster crow 
Never walked barefoot by a river 
Felt the mud up between your toes 
You never rolled in the hay 
You never thrown it in four wheel 
Climb up on here girl 
Let me show you how country feels 
Let your hair down, hair down 
Get you some of this laid on back 
Kick your shoes off, kick 'em off 
Get you some of this slow down fast 
I'll take you up and down these hollers and hills 
Let me show you how country feels 
You ever watched the sun go down 
From the bed of a pickup truck 
Ever been so into somebody 
You're still lying there when it comes back up 
Girl what do you say? 
Cut a path through that cornfield 
Park down by the water 
Let me show you how country feels 
Let your hair down, hair down 
Get you some of this laid on back 
Kick your shoes off, kick 'em off 
Get you some of this slow down fast 
I'll take you up and down these hollers and hills 
Let me show you how country feels

Get you some of this laid on back 
Kick your shoes off (Kick your shoes off)

2,Church Bells,Carrie Underwood,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/carrie-underwood/church-bells-chords-1776075,"Jenny grew up wild, like a blackfoot daisy    
Out in the shack with a blue tick hound    
Broke as hell, but blessed with beauty    
The kind that a rich man can't turn down    
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing    
One summer night in a dime store dress    
She had the looks, he had the mansion    
And you can figure out the rest    
He was all roses, dripping in diamonds, sipping on champagne    
She was all uptown, wearing that white gown, taking his last name    
She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing    
And up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing    
Fold your hands and close your eyes    
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright    
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing    
Yeah, they're ringing    
Jenny was hosting Junior League parties    
And having dinner at the country club    
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie    
But Ken was always getting way too drunk    
Saturday night, after a few too many    
He came home ready to fight    
And all his money could never save Jenny    
From the devil living in his eyes    
It was all bruises, covered in makeup, dark sunglasses    
And that next morning, sitting in the back pew, praying with the baptist    
She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing    
And up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing    
Fold your hands and close your eyes    
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright    
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing    
Yeah, they're ringing    
Jenny slipped something in his Tennessee whiskey    
No law man was ever gonna find    
And how he died is still a mystery    
But he hit a woman for the very last time    
She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing    
Standing there in a black dress singing, singing    
Fold your hands and close your eyes    
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright    
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing    
Yeah, they're ringing

Some days you blast off and some days you just smoke

And I still feel the sting of the pain,
But I brush my teeth anyway,
Got dressed through the mess,
and put a smile on my face
I got a little bit stronger
Ridin' in the car to work,
And I'm tryin' to ignore the hurt,
So I turned on the radio,
Stupid song made me think of you,
I listen to it for a minute,
But then I changed it,
I'm gettin a little bit stronger,
Just a little bit stronger
And I'm done hopin, that we can work it out,
I'm done with how it feels, spinnin my wheels,
Lettin you drag my heart around, and oh,
And I'm done thinking you could ever change,
I know my heart will never be the same,
But I'm tellin' myself I'll be okay,
Even on my weakest days,
I get a little bit stronger
It doesn't happen overnight,
but you turn around and months gone by,
And you realize you haven't cried,
Not givin' you an hour or a second
or another minute longer,
I'm busy gettin' stronger
And I'm done hopin, that we can work it out,
I'm done with how it feels, spinnin my wheels,
Lettin you drag my heart around, and oh,
And I'm done thinking you could ever change,
I know my heart will never be the same,
But I'm tellin' myself I'll be okay,
Even on my weakest days,
I get a little bit stronger
I get a little bit stronger
Gettin' on without you baby
I'm better off without you baby

I'm gettin' stronger without you baby

Everywhere I turned the doors were closin'
Took every ounce of faith I had to keep on keepin' on
And still I felt like I was only losin'
I refused then like I do now to let anybody tie me down
I lost a few good friends along the way
I was raised up poor and I wanted more and maybe I'm a little too proud
Lookin' back I see a kid who was just afraid
Hungry        and old before his time
Through the years I've known my share of broken-hearted fools
And those who couldn't choose a path worth taking
There's nothin' in the world so sad as talking to a man
Who never knew his life was his for makin’
Ain't it about time you realize it's not worth keepin' score?
You win some, you lose some, and you let it go
What's the use of stackin’ on every failure another stone
Till you find you've spent your whole life building walls
Lonely        and old before your time?
It took so lo-ng to see
That truth was all around    me
Now the wren has gone to roost and the sky is turnin' gold
And like the sky my soul is also turnin'
Turnin' from the past, at last, and all I've left behind
Could it be that I am finally learnin'?
Learnin' I'm deserving of love and the peaceful heart
I won't tear myself apart no more for tryin'
Tired of lyin' to myself, tryin' to buy what can't be bought
It's not livin' that you're doin' if it feels like dyin’

Here you are running these dirty old streets
Tattoo on your neck, fake gold on your teeth
Got the hood here snowed, but you cant fool me
We both know who you are
Homeboy, youre gonna wish one day,
That you were sittin on a gate of a truck by the lake
With your high school flame on one side, ice cold beer on the other
Aint no shame in a blue collar forty, little house, little kid, little
small town story
If you dont ever do anything else for me, just do this for me brother,
Come on home, boy.
I was haulin this hay to Uncle Joes farm,
Thought of us barefoot kids in the yard,
Man, it seems we were just catchin snakes in the barn
Now youre caught up in this mess
I could use a little help unloading these bales
I could keep you pretty busy with a hammer and nails
Aint a glamorous life but it will keep you outta jail,
Not worry us all to death
Homeboy, youre gonna wish one day,
That you were sittin on a gate of a truck by the lake
With your high school flame on one side, ice cold beer on the other
Aint no shame in a blue collar forty, little house, little kid, little
small town story
If you dont ever do anything else for me, just do this for me brother,
come on home, boy,
Come on home, boy
You cant hold back the hands of time,
Mamas goin grey, and so is daddys mind
I Wish youd come on back and make it all right
Before theyre called home, boy
Homeboy
Come on home, boy
Homeboy
Come on home, boy.

Now I'm rested and I'm ready,
I'm rested and I'm ready to begin
                                       I'm ready to begin
I went on the search for something real
Traded what I know for how I feel
But the ceiling and the walls collapsed
Upon the darkness I was trapped
And as the last of breath was drawn from me
The light broke in and brought me to my feet
There's no fortune at the end of the road that has no end
There's no returning to the spoils
Once you've spoiled the thought of them
There's no falling back asleep
Once you've wakened from the dream
Now I'm rested and I'm ready,
I'm rested and I'm ready
Yeah I'm rested and I'm ready
I'm rested and I'm ready
Yeah I'm rested and I'm ready
I'm rested and I'm ready
I'm ready to begin.

That poisons the well, and ruins my mind
I get took for a ride every time
Down with the glistening shine
It's in with the new, and out with the old
Out with the warm, and in comes the cold
It's the most predictable story told:
In with the young, out with the old
Down with the shine, the perfect shine
That poisons the well, and ruins my mind
I get took for a ride every time
Down with the glistening shine
A belly full of high dollar wines
A fat hand, a fat wallet too
Things change and get strange with the movement of time
It's happening right now to you
Down with the shine, the perfect shine
That poisons the well, and ruins my mind
I get took for a ride every time
Down with the glistening shine
It's a real bad time to bring up the truth
Though we searched, we found no fountain of youth
Not in Spain, nowhere near
Anywhere close to here
There's nothing good, because nothing lasts
And all that comes here, it comes here to pass
I would voice my pain, but the change wouldn't last
All that comes, comes here to pass
Down with the shine, the perfect shine
That poisons the well, and ruins my mind

Closing time another day is done
When a boy walks in the door and points a pistol
He can't find a job but Lord he's found a gun
He pulls it off with no trace of confrontation
Then he lets the old man run out in the street
Even though he knows they'll come with guns a blazing
already he can feel that great relief
Oh how many travelers get wear-y
Bearing both their burdens and their scars
Don't you think they'd love to start all o-ver
And fly like eagles out among the stars

Sees that old familiar anger in their eyes
He knows that when they're shooting at this loser
They'll be aiming at the demons in their lives

And in his own a bottle is thrown in anger

48,Hard Times (ver 2),Gillian Welch,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/gillian-welch/hard-times-chords-1503992,"There was a Camptown man, used to plow and sing
   And he loved that mule and the mule loved him
When the day got long as it does about now
    I'd hear him singing to his muley cow
Calling come on, my sweet old girl
I'd bet the whole damn world
And we're gonna make it yet to the end of the row
Singing hard times ain't gonna rule my mind
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind, Bessie
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind
No more
He said it's a big old world, heavy in need
  That big machine is just a-picking up speed
They were supping on tears and they were supping on wine
  But we all get to heaven in our own sweet time
So come all you Asheville boys
And turn up your old time noise
And kick till the dust comes up from the cracks in the floor
Singing hard times ain't gonna rule my mind, brother
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind
No more
But the Camptown man he doesn't plow no more
   I seen him walking down to the superette
Guess he lost that nag and he forgot that song
  Woke up one morning and the mule was gone
So come all ye ragtime kings
Come on you dogs that sing
  Pick up your dusty old horn and give it a blow
Playing hard times ain't gonna rule my mind, honey
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind, sugar
Hard times ain't gonna rule my mind
No more

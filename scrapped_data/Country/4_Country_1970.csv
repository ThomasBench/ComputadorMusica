0,You Never Even Called Me By My Name (ver 2),David Allan Coe,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/david-allan-coe/you-never-even-called-me-by-my-name-chords-456364,"It was all that I could do to keep from cryin'
Sometimes it seems so useless to remain
You don't have to call me darlin',  darlin'
You never even call me by my name
You don't have to call me Waylon Jennings
And you don't have to call me Charlie Pride
And you don't have to call me Merle Haggard...anymore
  Even though you're on my fightin' side
And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
'Cause I never minded standin' in the rain
You don't have to call me Darlin',  Darlin'
But you never even call me by my name
Well I've seen my name a few times in your phone book
And I've seen it on the signs where I've played
But the only time I know I'll hear ""David Allen Coe""
Is when Jesus has his final judgement day
And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
'Cause I never minded standin' in the rain
You don't have to call me Darlin',  Darlin'
But you never even call me by my name
Well I was drunk the day my Momma got out of prison
And I went to pick her up in the rain
But before I could get to the station in my pickup truck
My Momma, she got run over by a damned old train
So I'll hang around just as long as you will let me
'Cause I never minded standing in the rain
You don't have to call me darlin',  darlin'
But you never even call me...
I wonder why you don't call me...
Why don't you even call me by my name?

THE REST HE GOT WORKIN' ON OLD JUNK CARS IN THE DAY TIME. 
THEY LOOKED LIKE TOMBSTONES IN OUR YARD 
AND I NEVER SEEN HIM WHEN HE WASN'T TIRED AND MEAN. 
HE SOLD USED PARTS TO MAKE ENDS MEET, COVERED WITH GREASE FROM HIS HEAD TO HIS FEET, 
CUSSIN' THE SUN AND THE TEXAS HEAT, AND THE SKEETERS. 
AND THE NEIGHBORS SAY WE LIVE LIKE HICKS, 
BUT THEY BRING THEIR CARS FOR PA TO FIX ANYHOW. 
HE WAS VET'RIN PROUD, TRIED AND TRUE, HE'D FIGHT TILL HIS HEART WAS BLACK AND BLUE, 
DIDN'T KNOW HOW HE'D MAKE IT THROUGH, THE HARD TIMES. 
BOUGHT OUR HOUSE ON THE G.I. BILL,  
BUT IT WASN'T WORTH ALL HE HAD TO KILL TO GET IT. 
HE DRANK PEARL IN A CAN AND JACK DANIELS BLACK, CHEWED TOBACCO FROM A MAIL-POUCH SACK, 
HAD AN OLD DOG THAT WAS TRAINED TO ATTACK, SOMETIMES. 
HE'D GET DRUNK AND MEAN AS A RATTLESNAKE,  
AND THERE WASN'T TOO MUCH THAT HE WOULD TAKE, FROM A STRANGER. 
THERE WAS 13 KIDS AND A BUNCH OF DOGS, HOUSE FULL OF CHICKENS AND A YARD FULL OF HOGS, 
SPENT THE SUMMERTIME CUTTIN' UP LOGS FOR THE WINTER. 
TRYIN' LIKE THE DEVIL TO FIND THE LORD, AND WORKIN' LIKE A N---- FOR MY ROOM AND BOARD, 
COAL BURNIN' STOVE, NO NATURAL GAS, AND IF THAT AIN'T COUNTRY, I'LL KISS YOUR ASS. 
IF THAT AIN'T COUNTRY, IT'LL HAIRLIP THE POPE, 
IF THAT AIN'T COUNTRY, IT'S A DAMN GOOD JOKE. 
I'VE SEEN THE GRAND 'OLE OPRY AND I MET JOHNNY CASH, 
AND IF THAT AIN'T COUNTRY, I'LL KISS YOUR ASS. 
WELL, MOMMA SOLD EGGS AT THE GROCERY STORE, MY OLDEST SISTER WAS A FIRST-RATE WHORE, 
DAD SAYS SHE CAN'T COME HOME ANY MORE, AND HE MEANS IT. 
MA JUST SITS AND KEEPS HER SILENCE 
SISTER SHE LEFT 'CAUSE DAD GOT VIOLENT, AND SHE KNOWS IT. 
MOMMA SHE'S OLD, FAR BEYOND HER TIME, FROM CHOPPIN' TOBACCO 
AND I SEEN HER CRYIN WHEN BLOOD STARTED FLOWIN' FROM HER CALLOUSED HANDS, AND IT HURT ME. 
BUT SHE'D JUST KEEP WORKIN' TRYIN' TO HELP THE OLD MAN,  
FROM THE END OF ONE ROW AND BACK AGAIN,LIKE ALWAYS. 
SHE'D BEEN THROUGH HELL SINCE JUNIOR WENT TO JAIL, AND WHEN THE LIGHTS GO OUT SHE AIN'T NEVER FAILED, 
TO GET DOWN ON HER KNEES AND PRAY, 'CAUSE SHE LOVES HIM. 
SHE TOLD ALL THE NEIGHBORS HE WAS OFF IN THE WAR, 
FIGHTIN' FOR FREEDOM, HE'S GOOD TO THE CORE, AND SHE'S PROUD. 
OUR PLACE WAS A GRAVEYARD FOR AUTOMOBILES, AT THE END OF THE PORCH WERE 4 STACKS OF WHEELS, 
AND TIRES FOR SALE FOR A DOLLAR OR TWO, CASH. 
THERE WERE 50 HOLES IN THAT OLD TIN ROOF. 
ME AND MY FAMILY WAS LIVIN' PROOF, 
OF PEOPLE WHO FORGOT ABOUT POOR WHITE TRASH

Went back home, and I got into bed

Woke up the next morning about half past nine
The hacks and the buggies all standing in line
The gents and the gamblers standing all around
Taking little Sadie to her burying ground
Well I began to think what a deed I'd done 
Grabbed my hat and away I run
Made a good run, but a little too slow 
They overtook me in Jericho 
I'm standing on the corner reading a bill
Along came the sheriff from Thomasville 
Says ""Young man, aint' your name Brown?
Remember the night you blowed Sadie down?"" 
Oh, yes sir, my name is Lee
I murdered little Sadie in the first degree
First degree and the second degree 
Got any papers would you read 'em to me
Well they took me downtown all dressed in black 
Put me on the train and sent me back 
Sent me back to the county jail
I had nobody for to go my bail 
The judge and the jury they took the stand
The judge held the paper in his right hand
Forty-one days, forty-one nights 
Forty-one years to wear the ball and stripes

The chances your taking loving a free living man
Are you really sure you really want what you see

   ain't  much an old country boy like    me can        hack.
   It's      early to rise, early in the              sack:
       Thank God I'm a    country boy.
   A     simple kind of life never did me no          harm,
           raisin' me a family and          workin' on a  farm.
   My    days are all filled with an easy country     charm:
       Thank God I'm a    country boy.
        Well I  got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle.
        When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle;
        and life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle:
        Thank God I'm a country boy.
   When the work's all done and the sun's settin'  low
   I      pull out my fiddle and I        rosin' up the bow.
   But the   kids are asleep so I keep it kinda       low:
       Thank God I'm a    country boy.
   I'd   play ""Sally Goodin'"" all day if I            could,
   but the lord and my wife wouldn't        take it very  good.
   So I  fiddle when I can and I work when I          should:
       Thank God I'm a    country boy.
        Well I  got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle.
        When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle;
        and life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle:
        Thank God I'm a country boy.
   I        wouldn't trade my life for diamonds or jewels,
   I      never was one of them money     hungry        fools.
   I'd       rather have my fiddle and my farmin'     tools:
       Thank God I'm a    country boy.
   Yeah, city folk drivin in a black limou            sine,
   A       lotta sad people thinkin'        that's mighty keen.
    Son, let me tell ya now exactly what I mean
    I  thank God I'm a    country boy.

        And life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle:

   Well, my fiddle was my daddy's till the day he  died,
   And he took me by the hand and held me close to his  side.
   He said: ""Live a good life and play my fiddle with pride,
   And thank God you're a country boy.
   My    daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle,
   He      taught me how to work and play a tune on the   fiddle.
   He    taught me how to love and how to give just a little:
       Thank God you're a country boy.
         Well I  got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle.
        When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle;

Now you wear your skin like iron
Your breath's as hard as kerosene
You weren't your mama's only boy
But her favorite one it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
sank into your dreams
Pancho  was  a  bandit  boys
His  horse  was  fast  as  polished  steel
Wore  his  gun  outside  his  pants
For  all  the  honest  world  to  feel
Pancho  met  his  match  you  know
On  the  deserts  down  in  Mexico
Nobody  heard  his  dying  words
That's  the  way  it  goes
All  the  federales  say
They  could  have  had  him  any  day
They  only  let  him  hang  around
Out  of  kindness  I  suppose
Lefty  he  can't  sing  the  blues
All  night  long  like  he  used  to
The  dust  that  Pancho  bit  down  south
Ended  up  in  Lefty's  mouth
The  day  they  laid  poor  Pancho  low
Lefty  split  for  Ohio
Where  he  got  the  bread  to  go
There  ain't  nobody  knows
All  the  federales  say
They  could  have  had  him  any  day
They  only  let  him  slip away
Out  of  kindness  I  suppose
The  poets  tell  how  Pancho  fell
Lefty's  livin'  in  a  cheap  hotel
The  desert's  quiet  and  Cleveland's  cold
So  the  story  ends  we're  told
Pancho  needs  your  prayers  it's  true,
But  save  a  few  for  Lefty  too
He  just  did  what  he  had  to  do
Now  he's  growing  old

They  could  have  had  him  any  day
They  only  let  him  go  so  wrong

    And why the tears are in my eyes,  And I seem so far away
    Well sit yourself beside me love,  And put your hand in mine
    And I'll tell you of someone I loved,  Long long before your time
    Well I'm sitting here and thinking of, Those days, So long ago
    When I was just a child like you,  And the girl I used to know
    Through fields of green,We laughed and played,And sang our merry rhymes
    Oh summer days were warmer then,  Long long before your time
    Through childhood years, Our love did bloom, 
    'Till our hearts were just as one
    And we promised each eternal love, In the church below the town
    We settled in this little house,  I was proud to call her mine
    Oh we were young and happy then,  Long long before your time
    One lovely year was all we had, Until the sickness came
    And stole the roses from her cheeks,  My tears they fell like rain
    For nine long months,  She carried you,  But in the end she died
    She chose to go,  So you might live,  Long long before your time
    So you ask me why I look so sad,  On this bright summers day
    And why the tears are in my eyes,  And I seem so far away
    It's just you seem a lot like her,  When your eyes look into mine
    And you smile, So much like she did,  Long long before your time

And of the whole damn lot the only friend I got is a smoke and a cheap guitar

To the wife and family
After serving in the conflict overseas.
And the time that he served,
Had shattered all his nerves,
And left a little shrapnel in his knees.
But the morhpine eased the pain,
And the grass grew round his brain,
And gave him all the confidence he lacked,
With a purple heart and a monkey on his back.
There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes,
Jesus Christ died for nothin I suppose.
Little pitchers have big ears,
Don't stop to count the years,
Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios.
Sam Stone's welcome home
Didn't last too long.
He went to work when he'd spent his last dime
And soon he took to stealing
When he got that empty feeling
For a hundred dollar habit without overtime.
And the gold roared through his veins
Like a thousand railroad trains,
And eased his mind in the hours that he chose,
While the kids ran around wearin' other peoples' clothes...
There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes,
Jesus Christ died for nothin I suppose.
Little pitchers have big ears,
Don't stop to count the years,
Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios.
Sam Stone was alone
When he popped his last balloon,
Climbing walls while sitting in a chair.
Well, he played his last request,
While the room smelled just like death,
With an overdose hovering in the air.
But life had lost it's fun,
There was nothing to be done,
But trade his house that he bought on the GI bill,
For a flag-draped casket on a local hero's hill.
There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes,
Jesus Christ died for nothin I suppose.
Little pitchers have big ears,
Don't stop to count the years,
Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios.

Pinballs and pool halls flashing their lights.
Making change behind the counter in a penny arcade
Sat the fat girl daughter of Virginia and Ray
Lydia hid her thoughts like a cat
Behind her small eyes sunk deep in her fat.
She read romance magazines up in her room
And felt just like Sunday on Saturday afternoon.
But dreaming just comes natural
Like the first breath from a baby,
Like sunshine feeding daisies,
Like the love hidden deep in your heart.
Bunk beds, shaved heads, Saturday night,
a warehouse of strangers with sixty watt lights.
Staring through the ceiling, just wanting to be
Lay one of too many, a young PFC.
There were spaces between Donald and whatever he said.
Strangers had forced him to live in his head.
He envisioned the details of romantic scenes
After midnight in the stillness of the barracks latrine.
Hot love, cold love, no love at all.
A portrait of guilt is hung on the wall.
Nothing is wrong, nothing is right.
Donald and Lydia made love that night.
They made love in the mountains, they made love in the streams,
They made love in the valleys, they made love in their dreams.
But when they were finished there was nothing to say,
Cause mostly they made love from ten miles away.

On a warm summer's evenin' on a train bound for nowhere,
I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness
'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.
He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.
And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice.""
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow. 
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.
Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
know when to walk away and know when to run.
You don't count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.
Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep.
'Cause ev'ry hand's a winner and ev'ry hand's a loser,
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.""
And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
know when to walk away and know when to run.
You don't count your money when you're sittin' at the table.

His eyes like bullets burned
The suns upon a gambling day
His queen smiled low and blissfully
Lets make some wretched fool to play
Plain it was she did agree
He sent his Duce down into diamond
His four to heart and his tray to spade
Three kings with their legions come
Preparations soon were made
They voted club the days commander
Gave him an army, face and number
All but the outlaw jack of diamonds
And the aces in the sky
Well he gave his sevens first instructions
Spirit me a game of stud
Stakes unscarred by limitation
Between a man named Gold and a man named Mud
Club filled gold with greedy vapours
Till his long green eyes did glow
And mud was left with sighs and trembles
Watching his hard earned money go
Flushes fell on Gold like water
Tens they paired and paired again
But the aces only flew through heaven
And the diamond jack called no man friend
Now the diamond queen saw Muds ordeal
Began to think of her long lost son
Fell to her knees with a mothers mercy
And prayed to the angels every one
Now the diamond queen she prayed and prayed
And the diamond angel filled Muds hole
The wicked king of clubs himself
Fell face down in front of Gold
Now three kings come to clubs command
But the angels in the sky did ride
Three kings up on the streets of Gold
Three fireballs on the Muddy side
The club queen heard her husbands call
Bu lord that queen of diamonds joy
When the outlaw in the heavenly hall
Turned out to be a wandering boy
Now Mud he checked and Gold bet all
And Mud he raised and Gold did call
And the smile just melted off his face
When Mud turned over that diamond ace
Now here's what the story's told
If you feel like Mud you'll end up Gold

Someone warm them from below, 'til the rain comes tumbling down.
Pulling weeds and picking stones, man is made of dreams and bones.
Feel the need to grow my own 'cause the time is close at hand.
Grain for grain, sun and rain, find my way in nature's chain,
tune my body and my brain to the music from the land.
Plant your rows straight and long, temper them with prayer and song.
Mother Earth will make you strong if you give her love and care.
Old crow watching hungrily, from his perch in yonder tree.
In my garden I'm as free as that feathered thief up there.

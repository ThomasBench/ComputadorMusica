And you love to bat your eyelids, don't you?
You know all the times that I'm ashamed
And all those words you said, misspoken
To all the boys who left you broken
Ain't no need for placing any blame
'Cause if it wasn't for you cryin' there
In Ohio just last year
All the love I got would've been in vain
So I'll wake up for work
And tug a little on your shirt
Hope you know the depths I'd go would be insane
For a girl like you who needs trust but needs freedom
Who wants love but would be fine on her own
For a girl like you with her daddy's mannerisms
And a soft smile makes the distance less alone
In a world that's full of wanting what is next
I'll stay here with you, Elisabeth
You are here at just the right time
At twenty-three years, it's felt a lifetime
My mama, she must trust you through and through
'Cause she left me with a girl like you
a girl like you who needs trust but needs freedom
Who wants love but would be fine on her own
a girl like you with her daddy's mannerisms
And a soft smile makes the distance less alone
In a world that's full of wanting what is next
I'll stay here with you, Elisabeth
You ain't no shrinkin' violet, are you?
And you love to bat your eyelids, don't you?
You know all the times that I'm ashamed

Did the hammer come down?
All this down on my luck
Has been gettin' me down on my knees
Might have been something I need
'Cause I been chasin, rat racin'
Now my grass looks like Augusta
I been callin' up my mama, doin' some old friend checkin' in
It seems like where I'm going might be better than where I been
'Cause with all this goin' on
Findin' right in all this wrong and I finally see
The good Lord knows better than me
I got a little less in the bank
I get a little more use out of that old porch swing
I got a little more her holdin' on to little more me
Feel a little more free
'Cause I been chasin, rat racin'
Now my grass looks like Augusta
I been callin' up my mama, doin' some old friend checkin' in

Knows better than me
If the world does end
If He does come back
But if He takes His time
Well I've learned one thing
The good Lord knows better than me

I've made more time for fishin'
I went home to see my mama, been good hearing from old friends

Got a big old house and and a big old yard
A trophy wife and a bunch of cars
And a nice portfolio
The richest man in the graveyard
Worked real hard and came home late
Two kids in bed , cold dinner plate
Said some day I'll slow down
Some day rolled around
A hundred dollar bill folds in half just like a ten
The fiddle plays amazing grace just like a violin
And you can get there in an old truck or new Mercedes Benz
But we're all going out the same way we came in
We're all going out the same way we came in
The richest man in the graveyard
Got a big old marble headstone
Bunch of nice words chiselled on
and he's lying right beside
The poorest man in the graveyard
In the box that still ain't paid for
Bet they hang out after dark
And pretend to drink a beer
Saying, how'd we end up here

The fiddle plays amazing grace just like a violin
And you can get there in an old truck or new Mercedes Benz

I was cleanin' the 'yota out
Swing by the house anytime you want
Or I can drop it off
You know whiskey makes me honest
Tequila makes you mean
Last thing I remember you were cussin'
My keys were in the weeds
You threw 'em out
Said ""I'd love to see you leave
But I won't let you go kill yourself
So I staggered home alone
Still thinkin' about you
I'm through talkin' about all the things we can't change
It's hard movin' on
I don't want you gone
Ain't it strange the way we keep tryin' to tie down this thing
With these loose strings
Baby, if we weren't so hard-headed
Maybe we wouldn’t fight
And if you weren't so darn pretty
I might have slept last night
You say you can't live with me
Ah, but you can't live without
When I staggered home alone
Still thinkin' about you
I'm through talkin' about all the things we can't change
It's hard movin' on

Can they run down hill? Can they climb a tree?

Should I shut up or should I shout And maybe try and scare him off?
Or will pretty much most anything I do just piss him off?

As to just what to do
About them bears.
Yeah them old Grizzly blues
Got some conflicting views
And not too much good news
About them bears.
Well I think I read it someplace, 'They kill only what they eat'
So I fumbled through that guidebook Just how often do they eat meat?
Somebody find some matches, Let's do a study of some kind.
We'll make it scientific, And let's see what we can find.

But when he decides he's hungry it makes me wanna hibernate!

They'll dig up them horses They smell 20 Miles away.

But this bear don't seem endangered, It might be me that goes extinct!

Never seen the light on that bridge

Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you.
And now I'm lost, too late to pray,

By wood and glue, steel and wire

Dreamed to stand in the lights of a stage
Got a closet full of worn out shoes

As sure these old strings turn to rust
And I trust my fate will bring
Another set of hands to make this old girl sing

Hmm, hmm-hmm
When life is good again
I'll be a better friend
A bigger person when
Life is good again
More thoughtful than I've been
I'll be so different then
More in the moment when
Life is good again
I'll open up my heart
And let the whole world in
I'll try to make amends
When life is good again
We've been brought to our knees
We've been so ill at ease
There are no guarantees
But you know life goes on
This too shall pass away
Bring new and different days
We need to change our ways
And right our wrongs
Let's open up our hearts
And let the whole world in
Let's try to make amends
When life is good again
I'll open up my doors again
And hear the message in the wind
Repent of all my sins (Hallelujah)
When life is good again
I'll try to be someone
On which you can depend
A helping hand to lend
Let's open up our eyes
And see what's goin' on
If we're to move along
From where we've been
Let's open up our hearts
And let the love shine in (Shine in)
We've all got knees to bend
And we'll just pray 'til then
Ask God's forgiveness when
Life is good again
And it's gonna be good again
(It's gonna be, it's gonna be)
It's gonna be good again
It'll be alright (It'll be alright)
God's the reason for all things
You want rainbows, you get rain
We'll all be forever changed (Forever changed)
I'll sell my boat and fly my kite
Walk in the park, go out at night
And hold my loved ones extra tight
When everything is on the mend
I'll even drink with my old friends
Sing and play my mandolin
We'll make it through this long dark night
Darkness fades when faced with light
And everything's gonna be alright
When life is good again

On a cold and grey Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries
'cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto
People don't you understand
The child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me,
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads and look the other way
Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto
And his hunger burns
so he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal, and he learns how to fight
In the ghetto
Then one night in desperation
A young man breaks away
He buys a gun, steals a car,
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries
As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto
As her young man dies,
On a cold and grey Chicago mornin'
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto
In the ghetto...

Got lost in wonder of a sinful land
Yeah I took the drink, I liked the taste,
I burned the smoke, I sparked the blaze
That left me wantin'
When I was desperate, and I lost my faith
I found an angel in a broken place
She led me out when I went astray
She showed me peace, she lit the way
Gave me comfort
She led me out, when I went astray
She showed me peace, she lit the way
Gave me comfort
I guess I'm stuck out in the middle
Cause I got this reckless heart that I can't tame
Just when I think I've reigned it in a little
I'm still somewhere between the fire and flame
Someday I might find my way to heaven
Lord I hope there's still room on that train
But if you're looking for me tonight, I'll be out here burning bright
Somewhere between the fire and flame
I met a wise man
Deep in the shadows
He had a love there in his eyes
That perfect peace I recognized
I knew I wanted, I knew I wanted
He spoke the truth reached out to me
He took my hand I shook it free
Kept on walking

  I did my best just to fit in
  Broke my heart on the playground, mmh
  When they said I was different
Oh, now
Now, I'm all grown up and nothin' has changed
Yeah, it's still the same
It's a hard life on easy street
Just white painted picket fences far as you can see
If you think we live in the land of the free
You should try to be black like me
  My daddy worked day and night
  For an old house and a used car
  Just to live that good life, mmh
  It shouldn't be twice as hard
Oh, now
Now, I'm all grown up and nothin' has changed
Yeah, it's still the same
It's a hard life on easy street
Just white painted picket fences far as you can see
If you think we live in the land of the free
You should try to be, oh, black like me
Oh oh oh, oh  oh-oh oh 
Oh oh oh, oh  oh-oh oh 
I know
I'm not
The only one
Oh-oh, oh yeah
Who feels
Like I
I don't belong
It's a hard life on easy street
Just white painted picket fences far as you can see
And if you think we live in the land of the free
You should try to be, oh, black like me
Oh, and some day we'll all be free
And I'm proud to be, oh, black like me
And I'm proud to be black like me
I'm proud to be black like me
Black like me

Different people, same hearses
It's kinda hard to fight with each other
Laying down in the ground, six under
At every show I see my people
They ain't the same but they're all equal
One love, one God, one family
You're missing every color
If you're only seeing black and white
Tell me how you're gonna change your mind
If your heart's unmovable
We ain't that different from each other
From one to another, I look around
And see worldwide beautiful
Thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God
Oh, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God
Coast to coast, city to city
Reach out your hands if you're with me
Still got some work but we still got a dream
Every shade, every heart come together and sing
Oh, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God, thank God
You're missing every color
If you're only seeing black and white
Tell me how you're gonna change your mind
If your heart's unmovable

I remembered every word and line
   Even after all this time
  I could smell that perfume like
  She was sitting right there beside me
  Like it was July junior year
   Yeah I still love that song
  Sing along when it comes on but
  Shoulda heard it in a parking lot dark
  Like a match lighting back seat sparks
   I knew I had her when the silverado speakers
Started singing what I couldn’t
What I shoulda yeah
  Shoulda heard it first time I kissed her
  Just don’t sound the same now
   That light it was perfect
It was like a soundtrack to a small-town sundown
  It ain’t the same in Tuesday traffic
  From a stage in a cover band bar
  It’s just music it ain’t magic
  Like it was in your daddy’s car
  Shoulda heard it in a parking lot dark
  Like a match lighting back seat sparks
   I knew I had her when the silverado speakers
Started singing what I couldn’t
What I shoulda yeah
  Shoulda heard it first time I kissed her
  Just don’t sound the same now
   That light it was perfect
It was like a soundtrack to a small-town sundown
  It sang us through that firefly July high
First whiskey buzz staying up all night
Without her it just ain’t right
  Shoulda heard it in a parking lot dark
  Like a match lighting back seat sparks
   I knew I had her when the silverado speakers
Started singing what I couldn’t
What I shoulda yeah
  Shoulda heard it first time I kissed her
  Just don’t sound the same now

And since you ain't here, and there's frost on the beer
I guess you weren't talkin' 'bout the frigidaire, girl.
Nah, you never liked my mom, or my dog, or my friends
And the worst is
I never said one word
When you told me to turn down the Merle
But I might've finally found somethin' colder than you
Well, I'm happy as hell, and hell, it helps me raise it
Took your goodbye, and hell, it done erased it
Girl, I ain't drownin' your memory, these mountains
Are all that's in here gettin' blue
Baby, I might've finally found somethin' colder than you
Oh, we're better together, and that's somethin'
They never once said when they'd talk about us
But it don't leave a note when it's runnin' out
It just leaves a buzz, you ain't here to kill mine
But I might've finally found somethin' colder than you
Well, I'm happy as hell, and hell, it helps me raise it
Took your goodbye, and hell, it done erased it
Girl, I ain't drownin' your memory, these mountains
Are all that's in here gettin' blue
Baby, I might've finally found somethin' colder than you
Well thank God you left me
A twelve-pack of cold ones
'Cause that's somethin' I ain't ever
Gonna get tired of holdin'
Oh, 'cause I might've finally found somethin' colder than you
Well, I'm happy as hell, and hell, it helps me raise it
Took your goodbye, and hell, it done erased it
Girl, I ain't drownin' your memory, these mountains
Are all that's in here gettin' blue
Baby, I might've finally found somethin' colder than you
Yes, I did
Colder than you
So much colder than you, babe
Colder than you

I close my eyes but I can't sleep
I pray I drift away before the sunrise
So I can hold you for a minute in my dream
Oh what I'd give
To kiss your lips
And spin you around one more time
I'm still holdin' on, still holdin' on
To the moments we were given
I miss your love, I miss your light
Shining in the kitchen
Baby this house, yeah this whole town
A'int the same without you in em
Without you here, I'm goin through hell
On this side of heaven

You made every street turn to gold
My paradise, my sweet by and by
If time heals all then tell me why

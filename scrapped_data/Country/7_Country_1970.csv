0,Daddy Frank,Merle Haggard,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/merle-haggard/daddy-frank-chords-70493,"Daddy Frank played the guitar and the french harp,          
Sister played the ringing tambourine.          
She read our lips and helped the family sing.
That little band was all a part of living,
And our only means of living at the time;
Cause Daddy Frank the guitar man was blind.
Frank and mama counted on each other;
Their one and only weakness made them strong.
Mama did the driving for the family,
And Frank made a living with a song.
Home was just a camp along the highway;
A pick-up bed was where we bedded down.
Don't ever once remember going hungry,
But I remember mama cooking on the ground.
Daddy Frank played the guitar and the french harp,          
Sister played the ringing tambourine.          
She read our lips and helped the family sing.
That little band was all a part of living,
And our only means of living at the time;
Cause Daddy Frank the guitar man was blind.
Don't remember how they got acquainted;
I can't recall just how it came to be.
There had to be some special help from someone,
And blessed be the one that let it be.
Fever caused my mama's loss of hearing.
Daddy Frank was born without his sight.
And mama needed someone she could lean on,
And I believe the guitar man was right.
Daddy Frank played the guitar and the french harp,          
Sister played the ringing tambourine.          
She read our lips and helped the family sing.
That little band was all a part of living,
And our only means of living at the time;
Cause Daddy Frank the guitar man was blind.

1,Good Ole Boys Like Me,Don Williams,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/don-williams/good-ole-boys-like-me-chords-908901,"When I was a kid Uncle Remus he put me to bed
With a picture of Stonewall Jackson above my head
Then daddy came in to kiss his little man
With gin on his breath and a Bible in his hand
He talked about honor and things I should know
Then he'd stagger a little as he went out the door
I can still hear the soft southern winds in the live oak trees
And those Williams boys they still mean a lot to me  Hank and Tenn-essee
I guess we’re all gonna be what we’re gonna be
So what do you do with good ole boys like me
Nothing makes a sound in the night like the wind does
But you ain’t afraid if you’re washed in the blood like I was
The smell of cape jasmine through the window screen
John R. and the Wolfman kept me company
By the light of the radio by my bed
With Thomas Wolfe whispering in my head
I can still hear the soft southern winds in the live oak trees
And those Williams boys they still mean a lot to me  Hank and Tenn-essee
I guess we’re all gonna be what we’re gonna be
So what do you do with good ole boys like me
When I was in school I ran with a kid down the street
And I watched him burn himself up on bourbon and speed
But I was smarter than most and I could choose
Learned to talk like the man on the six o’clock news
When I was eighteen Lord I hit the road
But it really doesn't matter how far I go
I can still hear the soft southern winds in the live oak trees
And those Williams boys they still mean a lot to me  Hank and Tenn-essee
I guess we’re all gonna be what we’re gonna be
So what do you do with good ole boys like me
Yeah what do you do with good ole boys like me

He got a heck of a deal on a new Porsche car
He ain't wearing his usual grey business suit
He's got jeans and high boots with an embroidered star
And today he's forty years old, going on twenty
Don't look for the grey in his hair 'cause he ain't got any
He's got a young thing beside him that just melts in his hand
He's middle aged crazy, trying to prove he still can
He's gotta a woman he's loved for a long, long time at home
Ah, but the thrill is all gone when they cut down the lights
They've got a business that they spent a while coming by
Been a long uphill climb but now the profits are high
But today he's forty years old, going on twenty
And he hears of sordid affairs and he ain't had any
And the young thing beside him, you know she understands

Applejack picked apples but he picked the banjo too.
Play a song for me Applejack, Applejack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me Applejack, Applejack
Play a song, let your banjo ring.
Now I'd go down to Applejack's almost everyday
We'd sit and we'd drink applejack that old Applejack had made
Then he'd take his banjo down then he'd ask me if I'd sing
And he would play the banjo and I'd play my tambourine.
Play a song for me Applejack, Applejack
Play a song for me and I'll sing
Play a song for me Applejack, Applejack
Play a song, let your banjo ring.
That's when I was just a kid and now that I am grown
All I have are memories, old Applejack is gone
Oh but he left me his banjo and it always takes me back
And everytime I play it, I still hear Applejack.

Was his father's only boy
Born just south of Colby, Kansas
Was his mother's pride and joy
Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on
Love was just the way to live and die
Gold was just a windy Kansas wheatfield
Blue was just a Kansas summer sky
All the stories that he told me
Back when I was just a lad
All the memories that he gave me
All the good times that he had
Growin up a Kansas farmboy
Life was mostly havin fun
Ridin' on his daddy's shoulders
Behind a mule beneath the sun
Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on
Love was just the way to live and die
Gold was just a windy Kansas wheatfield
Blue was just a Kansas summer sky
Well, I guess there were some hard times
And I'm told some years were lean
They had a storm in '47
A twister came and stripped them clean
He lost the farm and lost his family
He lost the wheat and lost his home
But he found a family bible
Faith as solid as a stone
Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on
Love was just the way to live and die
Gold was just a windy Kansas wheatfield
Blue was just a Kansas summer sky
So he came to live at our house
And he came to work the land
He came to ease my daddy's burden
And he came to be my friend
So, I wrote this down for Matthew
And it's for him the song is sung
Ridin' on his daddy's shoulders
Behind a mule beneath the sun
Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on
Love was just the way to live and die
Gold was just a windy Kansas wheatfield
Blue was just a Kansas summer sky
Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on
Love was just the way to live and die
Gold was just a windy Kansas wheatfield
Blue was just a Kansas summer sky

   It's      early to rise, early in the              sack:
       Thank God I'm a    country boy.
   A     simple kind of life never did me no          harm,
           raisin' me a family and          workin' on a  farm.
   My    days are all filled with an easy country     charm:
       Thank God I'm a    country boy.
        Well I  got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle.
        When the sun's comin' up I got cakes on the griddle;
        and life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle:
        Thank God I'm a country boy.
   When the work's all done and the sun's settin'  low
   I      pull out my fiddle and I        rosin' up the bow.
   But the   kids are asleep so I keep it kinda       low:
       Thank God I'm a    country boy.
   I'd   play ""Sally Goodin'"" all day if I            could,
   but the lord and my wife wouldn't        take it very  good.
   So I  fiddle when I can and I work when I          should:
       Thank God I'm a    country boy.
        Well I  got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle.

   I        wouldn't trade my life for diamonds or jewels,
   I      never was one of them money     hungry        fools.
   I'd       rather have my fiddle and my farmin'     tools:
       Thank God I'm a    country boy.
   Yeah, city folk drivin in a black limou            sine,
   A       lotta sad people thinkin'        that's mighty keen.

   And he took me by the hand and held me close to his  side.

   And thank God you're a country boy.
   My    daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle,
   He      taught me how to work and play a tune on the   fiddle.

Sing your song sweet music man,
you travel the world with a six piece band that does for you,
what you ask it to,
and 'ya try to stay young but the songs you sung,
to so many people have all begun to come back on you.
So sing your song sad music man,
you're making your living doing one night stands that prove to you,
they don't need you,
you're still a helluva singer but a broken man,
but you’ll keep on looking for one last fan to sing to.
But nobody sings a love song quite like you do,
and nobody else could make me sing along,
and nobody else could make me feel,
that things are right when they're wrong with a song,
nobody sings a love song quite like you.
So sing your song sweet music man

Momma sewed the rags together  Sewing every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors  That I was so proud of
About a coat of many colors Joseph |wore and then she said
Perhaps this |coat will bring you  Good |luck and happiness
And I just |couldn’t wait to wear it And momma |blessed it with a kiss

Made only from rags But I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors My momma made for me
So with patches on my britches Holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing  And making fun of me
In my coat of many colors My momma made for me
And oh I couldn’t understand it  For I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love  My momma sewed in every stitch
And I told em all the story   Momma told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colors Was worth more than all their clothes
But they didn’t understand it And I tried to make them see
That one is only poor  Only if they choose to be

It ain't cause I don't smoke 'em myself,
and I don't reckon that it'll hinder your health,
I smoked 'em all my life, and I ain't dead yet.
But nicotine slaves are all the same,
at a pettin' party or a poker game,
everything gotta stop, while they have a cigarette.
Smoke, smoke, smoke that cigarette.

that you hate to make him wait,

Old Dame Fortune was good and right,
The kings and queens they kept on comin' around.
Aw, I was hittin' 'em good and bettin' 'em high,
but my bluff didn't work on a certain guy,
he kept callin', and layin' his money down.
See, he'd raise me, then I'd raise him,
and I'd say to him buddy, ya gotta sink or swim,
he finally called me but didn't raise the bet.
Hmmm..I said, Aces Full, pal..I got you!
He said, I'll pay up in a minute or two,

with the cutest little gal in any state,
a high-bred, uptown, fancy little dame.
She said she loved me and it seemd to me,
that things were sorta like they oughtta be,
so, hand in hand we strolled down lovers lane.
She was a long way from a chunk of ice,
and our pettin' party was goin' real nice,
and I got an idea I might have been there, yet.
So I give her a kiss and a little squeeze,
Then she said, Travis, excuse me please,
but I just gotta have a cigarette.

  Billy, and you're going all alone.
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number
So sleep with one eye open, when you wander
  Every little sound just might be thunder
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.
There's always another stranger sneaking glances
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances
  Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances
Advances on your spirit and your soul.
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down
So they've hired mister Garrett, he'll force you to slow down
  Billy, don't let it make you feel so low down
  To be hunted by the man who was your friend.
So hang on to your woman, if you got one
Remember in El Paso once you shot one
  I'll be in Santa Fe-a about one
Billy, you've been running for so long.
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
Way down in some Tula - rosa  alley
 Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley
Billy, you're so far away from home
Billy, you're so far away from home
Billy, you're so far away from home

I said, well I didn’t know
He said I turned 65  about 11 months ago
I was sitting in Miami pouring blended whisky down
When this old grey black gentleman was cleanin’ up the lounge
There wasn't any one around ‘cept this old man and me
The guy who ran the bar was watching ironsides on tv
Uninvited he sat down and opened up his mind
On old dogs and children  and watermelon wine
Ever had a drink of watermelon wine he asked
He told me all about it though I didn't answer back
Ain't but three things in this world that’s worth a solitary dime
But old dogs and children  and watermelon wine
He said women think about they-selves when men-folk ain't around
And friends are hard to find when they discover that you're down
He said I tried it all when I was young and in my natural prime
Now it's old dogs and children  and watermelon wine
Old dogs care about you even when you make mistakes
God bless little children while they're still too young to hate
When he moved away I found my pen and copied down that line
‘bout old dogs and children  and watermelon wine
I had to catch a plane up to Atlanta that next day
As I left for my room I saw him picking up my change
That night I dreamed in peaceful sleep of shady summertime
Of old dogs and children  and watermelon wine

like the movie says it was
I don't remember dance hall girls 
Or hotel rooms with rugs 
You worked hot and tired and nasty
Rode your pony's head too low 
And all them nights you couldn't sleep
Cause it was too damn cold 
And we sing Strawberry Roan, Little Joe
Like the time we hit the river 
And the rain begun to fall 
The water risin' so damn fast
We thought it'd drown us all 
Now we lost a lot of steers that day 
And four or five good mounts 
But when all the boys rode into camp
We knew that's what counts 
And we sang, yippie ti yi yay, Amazing Grace
Or the night they broke behind us 
And they took us by surprise 
I whistled out to Bonner 
I saw the terror in his eyes
And he rode for all his horse would ride 
And I know he done his best 
But he crossed over Jordan
Ridin' Dunny to his death 
And we sang, Bringing in the Sheaves and The Rugged Cross
When you see the cowboy
He's not ragged by his choice 
And he never meant to bow them legs 
Or put that gravel in his voice 
Just chasin' what he really loves
What's burnin' in his soul 
Wishin' to hell that he'd been born a hundred years ago
Still singin' Strawberry Roan and Little Joe
still singin' Strawberry Roan... and Little Joe

Keep your eyes wide open

Then sneaky snake goes dancing

Sneaky snaky snake goes dancing
A gigglin' and a hissin'
I don't like ol' sneaky snake
He laughs too much you see
When he goes wigglin' through the grass
It tickles his underneath
Well, sneaky snake drinks root beer
and he just makes me sick
When he is not dancing
he looks just like a stick
Now, he doesn't have any arms or legs
You cannot see his ears
And when you are not lookin'
he's stealin' all of our beer
Then sneaky snake goes dancing

Sunday School teacher, what brings you out slumming?
Do you reckon the preacher would approve where you are,
standing here visiting with a back-sliding Christian
in a neighborhood bar?
Well, yes that's my bottle and yes that's my glass.
And I see you're eye-balling this pretty young lass.
It ain't none of your business, but yes, she's with me.
And we don't need no sermon, you self-righteous woman,
just let us be.
The Lord knows I'm drinking, and running around.
And He don't need your loud mouth, informing the town.
The Lord knows I'm sinning, and sinning ain't right.
But me and the Good Lord's gonna have us a good talk,
later tonight.
Goodbye Mrs. Johnson, you self-righteous biddy.
I don't need your preaching, and I don't need your pity.
So, go back to whatever you hypocrites do.
And when I talk to Heaven, be nice, and I'll put in a good 
word for you.
The Lord knows I'm drinking, and running around.
And He don't need your loud mouth, informing the town.
The Lord knows I'm sinning, and sinning ain't right.

Promised her he'd take her for his bride.

Were the sweetest stories ever told
Maybe we will live them all again
And my blue moon again will turn to Gold

0,Ill Be Lovin You,Miranda Lambert,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/miranda-lambert/ill-be-lovin-you-chords-4172266,"Every highway
Every stranger that I met
Well, I went my way
But I never really left
And when I’m lonely
And I’m needing something new
When I’m lost in the mazes and turning the phrases and looking for something true
I’ll be lovin’ you
No matter where I roam
I’ll be lovin’ you
You’re at the end of every road
When the stars are out at night
When the sky is crystal blue
I’ll do the only thing I know to do
I’ll be lovin’ you
I’ll be lovin’ you
Tried to find it
In the rosеs in the snow
Tried to climb it
In a Rocky Mountain low
I couldn’t hide it
Likе the bottle in my boot
When I’m deep in the dark and I look in my heart and I’m looking for something true
I’ll be lovin’ you
No matter where I roam
I’ll be lovin’ you
You’re at the end of every road
When the stars are out at night
When the sky is crystal blue
I’ll do the only thing I know to do
I’ll be lovin’ you
Through the joy and the pain and the Mandolin Rain and the nights with the man in the moon
You’ll always belong at the end of my song
Even if I’m out of tune
I’ll be lovin’ you
No matter where I roam
I’ll be lovin’ you
You’re at the end of every road
When the stars are out at night
When the sky is crystal blue
I’ll do the only thing I know to do
I’ll be lovin’ you
I’ll be lovin’ you
I’ll be lovin’ you
I’ll be lovin’ you

1,Thats What Makes The Jukebox Play,Miranda Lambert,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/miranda-lambert/thats-what-makes-the-jukebox-play-chords-4172272,"For the stranger drinking anger on the rocks at the end of the bar
For the Carolines sipping their wine hoping this is where the good ones are
For the lovers making out in a corner booth
For the one over there, don’t think I didn’t notice you
That’s what makes the jukebox play
When you live like neon
There’s a song you can lean on
That’s what makes the jukebox play
When the night won’t end
‘Cause it plays ovеr and over and over again
For the bеlt buckle shiner, she’s starting all the fires in her Levi jeans
For the one who doesn’t come here anymore ‘cause he’s getting over me
For the one stirring up her emotions in the ice with her fingertips
She showed up with somebody but that ain’t who she’s leaving with
That’s what makes the jukebox play
When you live like neon
There’s a song you can lean on
That’s what makes the jukebox play
When the night won’t end
‘Cause it plays ovеr and over and over again
For my old dive bar with the hand drawn heart, hanging lonely on the bathroom door
For the old dance hall with the mirror ball throwing starlight on the floor
That’s what makes the jukebox play
When you live like neon
There’s a song you can lean on
That’s what makes the jukebox play
When the night won’t end
‘Cause it plays ovеr and over and over again
It plays over and over and over

Shreveport sailing all the way to the bank
She was fish net fancy for a buffet line

Show boat baby, gonna make a little green
Rolling down the river on a Music City Queen
Rolling down the river
Yeah, we’re rolling down the river
Terry kinda thinks he’s Jerry Lee Lewis
Plays “Great Balls of Fire” like there ain’t nothing to it
Tina never quite had a Hollywood body
But she makes a damn good look alike Dolly (Wooh, Dolly)
 Working 9 to 5
But ‘round about 10:30 (10:30)
All the jokes
They get dirty (That’s dirty)
And the waitress
She gets flirty (You’reflirty)
In the right light
She kinda purty, everybody just

You can still be a star
Get to boozin’ and cruisin’
Maritime is a charm
Didn't make it in Vegas
If the magic is gone
If your flashy and trashy

I'll be somewhere lookin' back at loved ones left behind
My life has been a wonder and I found my place in time
But I don't go to funerals, I won't be at mine
I'll be somewhere singin' songs with all those friends of mine
Life is great, but I can't wait to make our memories rhyme
Now those who've gone before me will save my place in line
I don't go to funerals, I won't be at minе
There'll be a big ol' pickin' party whеn it comes my time
Me and Waylon, John and Chris and our sweetheart Patsy Cline
Merle and Grady and Freddy Powers, all those pals of mine
But I don't go to funerals, I won't be at mine

Sayin' how it won't be long 'til time to fly again

4,A Beautiful Time,Willie Nelson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/willie-nelson/a-beautiful-time-chords-4173766,"Drinking a black coffee
In a little motel lobby
Waiting on the band to come down
Then travelling across Texas
In an old station wagon
I'm dragging my trailer around
I do the driving
They do the drinking
That's how I keep us alive
Now we played a good show
Last night in Waco
We still got an eight hour drive
If I ever get old I'll still love the road
Still love the way that it winds
When the last song's been played
I'll look back and say
I sure had a beautiful time
Now we're packed up and rolling
Who cares where we're going
 The radio's playing sweet country sounds
Got the sun on my skin
My hair's in the wind
And all of the windows rolled down
If I ever get old I'll still love the road
Still love the way that it winds
When the last song's been played
I'll look back and say
I sure had a beautiful time
They're having a party
In the back seat well lordy
Looks like they're all out of beer
They're laughing at good jokes
Rolling the good smoke
Well I know y'all will pass that one up here
If I ever get old I'll still love the road
I'll still love the way that it winds
When the last song's been played
I'll look back and say
I sure had a beautiful time

No, you don't need to know her name
She could turn right on a nickel
And give you back four cents in change
My heart was a dancer
She made her livin' on her toes
And what she ever saw in me
Only God and Heaven knows
I used to sit at my table
Just me and whiskey all alone
Watchin' my heart dance
And each night, I'd try to take her home
Others would try to show my heart
A better way to feel
My heart was a dancer
Oh, heart, please just don't bе still
My heart was a dancer
I'd love to see hеr dancin' now
Pretty and graceful
Still beatin' just for me somehow
My heart was a dancer
Another lifetime ago
She was real for me
But for the others, it was all just a show
I used to sit at my table
Just me and whiskey all alone
Watchin' my heart dance
And each night, I'd try to take her home
Others would try to show my heart

He humped up his back, but he just wouldn't kick
Theres something cock-eyed somewhere.
Old hounds a'howlin' so forlorn
Thats the laziest dog that ever was born
He's howlin' because he's sittin' on a thorn
An' he's just too tired to move over.

This I know, this I know

Each song in my breast dies of boredom

How do I find what I’m looking for

From the pyramid of cans to the call

To the straps slipping off of your hips

To the glue

From the start of the affair
To the last kiss we would share

With nothing but the touch of her hand.

Be her strength and take the lead
But when it comes to everything that really matters
She's stronger than me
She lifts the weight of this whole world off of my shoulders
With nothing but the touch of her hand.
And every day I wake up and I tell her that I love her I feel more, like a man

Leatherbound King James, Redneck roots
Browning 243 rifle, Zebco 33 rod and reel
That's who I am, Still
American made, Homegrown Proud
Old school country,New school crowd
Raised up in a small town grounded
On blue collar dollar bills
That's who I am, still
This whole world spinning round like a top
Aint throwing me off anytiome real soon
Cause there's something bout sticking to your guns
While everybody's singing a different tune
Yeah change will come and go
But you know I'm settled in digging the fields
Of who I am,  still
You know it don't matter, if all my hopes and dreams
Take off flying on silver wings
Just my father's son like the one on Calvary's hill
Is all i am,  still
This whole world spinning round like a top
Aint throwing me off anytiome real soon
Cause there's something bout sticking to your guns
While everybody's singing a different tune
Yeah change will come and go
But you know I'm settled in digging the fields
Of who I am,  still
You can blame it on my grandaddy's
Past down through my daddys ride and rebel stubborn will
For who I am,  still
Yeah that's who I am

We drove around that farm that night
Past the pond down the trail
In the woods we went deeper nothing but country in sight
Then the sky went dark, saw that tobacco barn
sitting like heaven on the hill
You took off and ran you smiled at me
All I could think was damn
This is the best night ever
Quarter moon peaking through the pines painting lines on your face
while I’m thinking it’s the best night ever
I was praying it wouldn’t end then the clouds rolled in
Started raining and your hair got wet and you laughed I was dying
I’ve never seen you so beautiful darling running through rain in the dark
Best night ever
And you pulled me in hard under that Old Barn
oh my god it was the best night ever
Never done nothing like that before
We just stayed right there and listened to that rain hit the tin roof
And damn it poured
That old orange tractor could talk
Sure have a lot to say it’s gonna stay right there between
me and her and the Tennessee rain
It was the best night ever
Quarter moon peaking through the pines painting lines on your face
while I’m thinking it’s the best night ever
I was praying it wouldn’t end then the clouds rolled in
Started raining and your hair got wet and you laughed I was dying
I’ve never seen you so beautiful darling running through rain in the dark

And the night will all be changed into day.
There will be peace in the valley for me, some day,
There will be peace in the valley for me, Oh Lord, I pray.
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, and no trouble I'll see,
And there will be peace in the valley for me.
Oh the bear will be gentle and the wolf will be tame,
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes
And the beast from the wild will be led by a child,
And I'll be changed, yes changed from this creature  that I am.
There will be peace in the valley for me, some day,

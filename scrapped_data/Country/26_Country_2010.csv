Wrap me up in skin
Hold me close
Enough to breathe me in
Moon's a fingernail
Scratching on the back
Of the night
In which we live beside
I held every inch of you
I wrote every line for you
I made time when time was all but gone
You're the love I've always known
The night's so dark and grey
But you've helped me find my way
Through the wilds
And wonders of this world
So take me with you now
'Cuz I need to show you how
I can love you
Better than before
I held every inch of you
I wrote every line for you
I made time when time was all but gone
You're the love I've always known

I am yours
And you're the love I know

You're the love I've always known

2,Most People Are Good,Luke Bryan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/luke-bryan/most-people-are-good-chords-2225457,"I believe kids oughta stay kids as long as they can
Turn off the screen, go climb a tree, get dirt on their hands
I believe we gotta forgive and make amends
Cause nobody gets a second chance to make new old friends
I believe in working hard for what you've got
Even if it don't add up to a hell of a lot
I believe most people are good
And most Mama's oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better underneath neon stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good
I believe streets of gold are worth the work
But I still wanna go even if they were paved in dirt
I believe that youth is spent well on the young
Cause wisdom in your teens would be a lot less fun
I believe if you just go by the nightly news
Your faith in all mankind would be the first thing you lose
I believe most people are good
And most Mama's oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better underneath neon stadium lights

Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of

I believe that days go slow and years go fast
And every breath's a gift, the first one to the last

Searching for the free man's ground 
And he came to bet his fortune 
On a West Virginia plow 
He built a house of timber
And raised a redhead son 
Then they worked the land together 
And prayed the rain would come 
There's a scarecrow in the garden 
That looks like Lucifer 
And I've been reading Revelations 
With my bare feet in the dirt
Well the redhead's son got older 
And took a brown eyed wife 
And the fields were green as dollars 
Cause the dirt was black as night 
I came in late September 
The youngest one of three 
And my sisters off and married 
So the land was left to me 
There's a scarecrow in the garden 
That looks like Lucifer 
And I've been reading Revelations 
With my bare feet in the dirt
I know every single fencepost 
Every rock that goes around 
I've been staring at the red oak 
Where I know they'll lay me down 
The fields ain't what they once were
The rains just seem to flood
 And I've been thinking about that river 
Wondering how it turns to blood 
I've been sitting here all morning 
I was sitting here all night 
There's a bible in my left hand 
And a pistol in my right

If it's something that you gotta get over but you just can't get over
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody

Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
On a midnight street in the summer rain

‘Cause you don’t wanna go home when it’s closin’ time
If you wanna kiss somebody
Baby, I got somebody in mind
 You can kiss like your heart ain’t ever been broke
 The kind of lips that your lips get your eyes to close
 I know just what you’re goin’ through
 ‘Cause I wanna kiss somebody, too
Kiss somebody like you, I wanna kiss somebody like you
 Sometimes you try to fix somebody
 Just to find out they’ll never change
 So you go out and meet somebody
That makes you feel the way you thought you’d never feel again
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody
In the back of a cab or on a subway train
Sometimes you gotta kiss somebody

Girl meets boy, girl don't make it harder than it has to be
Come and lay one on me

 You can kiss like your heart ain’t ever been broke

 Yeah I know what you’re goin’ through, I do

6,A Tornado Warning,Turnpike Troubadours,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/turnpike-troubadours/a-tornado-warning-chords-2242137,"  We were sitting on the front porch
  With the weather rolling in
  Laughing louder than the big south wind
  You ran out to roll your window up
  Light rain falling on your hair
  Your tan legs checkered from a folding chair
There's country music in the kitchen
  I hear it singing through the screen
  Weather warnings in between
  Glad you got out of the city
  There's no telling what's in store
  Along the 35 Corridor
Kerosene to feed the flame
Your effect is quite the same
Shadows dancing on the wall and
Waiting for the sky to fall
  Couldn't ask for better weather
  You were saying with a grin
  Until the sound of hailstone hitting tin
  It's loud enough you gotta yell now
  The whole thing hits me like a song
  A pretty one that won't last long
Kerosene to feed the flame
Your effect is quite the same
Shadows dancing on the wall and
Waiting for the sky to fall and
Waiting for the sky to fall
In the broken morning light
That simple shade of blue
The kind that always follows you
Kerosene to feed the flame
Your effect is quite the same
Shadows dancing on the wall and
Waiting for the sky to fall and
Waiting for the sky to fall

 Smiling a lot when you look at your phone
 There's a change in your tone
I've been through your pockets and smelled your shirts
I don't wear Bath and Body Works
Should've seen the signs you were sneakin' around
She must be the number on the napkin I found
 Didn't love me
 I ain't no fool
 Didn't love me
No, no, no, no

I was blinded by my love (uh-huh)
I did everything for you
And now push has come to shove
So lets call a spade a spade
Was it worth the price you paid? (uh-uh)

Ring them bells from the sanctuaries cross the valleys and streams
For they're deep and they're wide
And the world on its side
And time is running backwards
And so is the bride.
Ring them bells Saint Peter where the four winds blow
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know
For it's rush hour now
On the wheel and the plow
And the sun is going down upon the sacred cow.
Ring them bells Sweet martha for the poor man's son
Ring them bells so the world will know that God is one
Oh the shepherd is asleep
Where the willows weep
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf
Ring them bells for all of us who are left
Ring them bells for the chosen few
Who will judge the many when the game is through
Ring them bells for the time that flies
For the child that cries
When the innocence dies.
Ring them bells Saint Catherine from the top of the room
Ring them from the fortress for the lilies that bloom
Oh the lines are long and the fighting is strong
And they're breaking down the distance between right and wrong.

There were junkies lying on the ground
They made me look away
And I spilled you on a mirror
And I chopped you into lines
And over some old kitchen sink
I swore I'd let you die

In a storefront in a picture, on an old broken TV
I swear it was you staring back at me
Old radios and broken mirrors
Dogeared things I read
Worn out movie stars
In faded limousines
I battled through my own charades
Of Coffee cups and clowns
I can't keep up with parades
I keep falling down

Where rusty wheels and steel rails still whine
Where I can hop that 909 and go back in time some time ago

Park my horse and buggie by some old lazy creek
Take my car to the graveyard and dig a hole real deep
We’ll holler “rest in peace” and weep, lay track on every street
Let the whistle wail and give the rail my soul to keep

39,Heads Gonna Roll,Jenny Lewis,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jenny-lewis/heads-gonna-roll-chords-1971003,"Since I haven’t talked to you, I
Dream about your baby blues, and
Wonder why you stopped getting high
And even though we were just friends, I
Think of us as bookends, and I
Gonna love you till I die
And you think you’re going to heaven
And that I am going to hell
And that I’m gonna keep on dancing
Till I hear that ringing bell
Heads gonna roll, baby
Everybody’s gotta pay their toll, and maybe
After all is said and done
We’ll all be skulls
Heads gonna roll (roll)
Took a little trip up north, in a
Borrowed convertible red Porsche, with a
Narcoleptic poet from Duluth
And we, disagreed about everything, from
Elliot Smith to Grenadine, he
Fell asleep and I put up the roof
And he took me to a graveyard
I thought he’d kill me there
And he kissed me on the corner
While the nuns of Harlem stared, Oh-h
Heads gonna roll, baby
Everybody’s gotta pay their toll, and maybe
After all is said and done
We’ll all be skulls
Heads gonna roll (roll)
Smoking Marlboro cigarettes
Almost makes me forget, about
Riding on a private jet with you
I hope the sycophants in Marrakesh
Make you feel your very best
Anonymity must make you blue
And you think I’m going to heaven
And that you are going to hell
With your back to the medina
As if you were in jail
Heads gonna roll, baby
Everybody’s gotta pay their toll, and maybe
After all is said and done
We’ll all be skulls
Heads gonna roll (roll)
Heads gonna roll, ladies
We’re gonna drink until they close, and maybe
A little bit of hooking up
Is good for the soul
Heads gonna roll

where the rolling tide can't reach the things that I hide

Colour me blue and grey river carry me fast away

Since home is where the jar is
Open up to me
Your heart will always have a place to live

There's never been a love like this before
On rainy days we'll drink until the gray is left in 
nothing but our hair
These wrinkles are the maps of all the places we went
No one else would dare
When your tongue is putrid
And your skin is sagging down
I'll stick around

Looks to my mind just like a maze
When I see you around
No honey you are not a kid
You know how to keep it hid
And I know just what you did
In those buildings downtown
In the Party's balcony
Where you caught up with me
Said you were not through with me
Well I could have guessed
Afternoons were losing light
December's moon was shining bright 
That's when you thought you just might
Settle for the best
We was in Vancouver town
The town that I finally let you down
You was in some evening gown
I was wearing jeans
Sometimes we run alongside each other 
Sometimes behave like there's no other
Sometimes we make horrible lovers
Sometimes we're just mean
The way you kissed my unshaven face
Disappeared without a trace  
Maybe I'll get my own little place
Overlooking the ocean
Pacific Northwest on a southbound train
Buffalo clouds hanging above the plain
Some say I'm different, some say I'm the same
Some say I go through the motions
Something did change inside of me
Changed something in the way I see
See those shadows hanging on the streets
You cannot outmaneuver time
I'm only leaving 'cause I can't stay
I always loved you and I, I never payed
I hear that even in LA

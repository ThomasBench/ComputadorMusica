I barely manage to hang on
But there's some reasons why I just can't let go
It won't be long til the baby's gone
Today she's here, tommorow grown
The ties that binds us will be behind us
Then you'll be free
Oh, it's past my supper time
That hunger pain has made me lose my mind
I've been starvin for some love you gave away
I'd like to make you pay by makin you stay
I've given you life and a day
The ties that binds us will soon be behind us
Then you'll be free
Oh, what you want is what you'll get
Oh, but I ain't ready to give it to you yet
You love the parties and the parties you love
And we're left the heartache you never think of
It won't be long until they're gone
Today they're here, tomorrow grown
The ties that binds us will be behind us
Then you'll be free
The ties that binds us will be behind us
Then you'll be free

A suburban mansion - I'm told
But the power's all off - and the phone lines are dead
And the hallways - are lonely - and cold
So I spend all my time - in hotels and barrooms
Watching the whiskey - they pour
Between airports and highways - and the nightlife that's my way
I never - go home - anymore
I never go home anymore
There'd be no one to greet me - if I came to the door
I stay around where there's parties - and people too loud to ignore
But I never - go home - anymore, anymore

And lately all I've been seeing are people
Throwing love away and losing their minds;
Maybe it's me that's gone crazy,   'Cause I can't figure out why;
All these lovers keep hurting each other,
When good love is so hard to come by;
So what's the glory in living?
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore?
And if love never lasts forever, tell me  What's Forever For?
I've been listening to people   and they say love is the key;
And it's not my way to let them lead me astray;
It's only that I want to believe;
I see love hungry people tryin' their best to survive,
While in their head they dream of romance,
If they can keep it alive;
So, what's the glory in living?
Doesn't anybody ever stay together anymore?
And if love never lasts forever, tell me What's Forever For?

	Something whispered in the wind,she ain't coming home
	Looking for Suzanne,looking for Suzanne
	Suzanne went away,as i think about it today
	As hard as i try i can't understand,looking for Suzanne
	Each walking moment,each sleepless night
	I search for the one that i love,the rest of my life
	Looking for Suzanne
	Looking for Suzanne (til end ...)

She hears his car as he pulls in the drive
Dinner's still waiting from hours before
She knows he's been drinking when he walks through the door
In anger he strikes out and she starts to cry
How much more can she take, how much more can she lie
And she fell down the stairs again
But it hasn't happened since she don't know when
Was it in spring when she packed up the kids
Or maybe in winter with his job on the skids
Oh, but just like before she'll have to pretend
That she fell down the stairs again
A short time ago, she started a job
Serving chicken fried steak and corn on the cob
She started out shy, but she ended up sure
That a ticket to anywhere could be the cure
But he couldn't handle her change for the better
She tried to leave him, but he wouldn't let her
He says he's sorry, he didn't mean it
He swears it won't happen again
But she's so confused, she wants to believe it
She just wants this nightmare to end
And she fell down the stairs again
But it hasn't happened since she don't know when
Was it in spring when she packed up the kids
Or maybe in winter with his job on the skids
Oh, but just like before she'll have to pretend
That she fell down the stairs again

You wrote to me in school
And that shoebox full of photographs
Got lost in my last move
I gave away that old twin bed
Where you and I first laid
But after all this time
I've still got the love we made
And that old beat up car we dated in
Finally turned to rust
And the first rose that you gave me
Oh, it finally turned to dust
But all those tender nights we shared
Are never gonna fade
'Cause after all this time
I've still got the love we made
I've got every feeling we felt when touched
'Cause even though it fell apart I kept a part of us
I've held on to every time
We held each other tight
And promised that, no matter what
We'd never say goodbye
I don't have one souvenir
Of us I'd meant to save
But right here in my heart 
I've still got the love we made

28,Quiet Faith Of Man,Jerry Jeff Walker,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jerry-jeff-walker/quiet-faith-of-man-chords-2919371,"A baby child is born along the highway
A tiny little thing upon the land
An okie with his dreams out on the byway
Lifts the tiny baby in his hand
The woman smiles a little smile of knowing
And whispers something softly in his ear
Perhaps a little prayer to help the growing
Perhaps a word of comfort through the fears
You trust the moon to move the mighty ocean
You trust the sun to shine upon the land
The little that you know and you do the best you can
You see the rest with the quiet faith of man
Now a tractor makes its way along the fence line
And drops the seeds precisely in a row
If the rains are kind and the winds don't take the topsoil
Before too long the crops will start to show
The farmer sees the fields around him growin'
He whispers something low beneath his breath
Perhaps a little prayer to help the growin'
Perhaps a word of thanks for all the rest
You trust the moon to move the mighty ocean
And you trust the sun to shine upon the land
Take the little that you know and you do the best you can
You see the rest with the quiet faith of man
There's a storm tossed ship tonight out on the ocean
There's a soul somewhere adrift out on the blue
There's a dreamer with his eyes upon the heavens
They're all looking for a way to make it through
You trust the moon to move the mighty ocean
And you trust the sun to shine upon the land
Take the little that you know and you do the best you can
You see the rest with the quiet faith of man
You trust the moon to move the mighty ocean
And you trust the sun to shine upon the land
Take the little that you know and you do the best you can
You see the rest with the quiet faith of man

She's off to the races, loves tropical places
And little bits of snow are cool
She loves foreign cars and small smoky bars and she loves me too

Yea, I found a lady who's never too lazy to give me little things I need
Who lady who can get her hands little dirty too
She can rock me and roll me, then love me, console me, she can cuss me too
Her friends know she's honest, she's loyal and modest
She knows the proper things to do
She's nobody's fool, she plays by the rules, ah, she loves me too, she's a lady
Yea, I found a woman in Texas, who's now such a part of my life
Yea, I found a lady, who carried our babies and pointed the way for our lives

A ticket on some ole' ship or pla-ane

Just to wash away the dirt
And then it's over to American Express

Was so full, they barred the door
And I sang a song that she Loves so well

To make up another song
About a sad and a lonesome farewell

Spread my blanket on the floor

Sleep finally comes to me
and I drift across the sea
To the waiting arms of the girl I love so well

I saw some old friends hangin' from a tree on Hobie's Hill.
By their tattered legs they dangled drippin' down along the spine.
It was old George Gudger's overalls a-drying on the line.
George Gudger, he's an honest cuss, and he loves to work his land.
And I'd long admired his overalls that I held there in my hand.
My brand new pair was stiffer than a starched-up Sunday suit.
But his could walk around by their selves and plow the corn to boot!
Now the knees looked almost bloody from the red Hale County clay.
George Gudger's debts and prayers had kept him kneelin' down all day.
Old George owes me money, but I owe him my respect.
And if his overalls will fit me, Boys, I'll forget about his debt.
I stepped in to them big old legs like fallin' down a mine.
Then I heard a ragged chuckle, and there stood old George behind.
A smile of old tobacco juice just tricklin' down agin.
He says, ""You might as well try walkin' round in someone else's skin
""But son, if you like them old friends of mine so much, I guess I can let 'em go
 Had to lend 'em to me wife last year, while she's carry'n Little Joe.
She bent down in the fields one day and split that tired old seam
And now she gone and beat 'em half to death on that rock there by the stream'
Yeah the knees looked almost bloody from the red Hale County clay.
George Gudger's debts and prayers had kept him kneelin' down all day
You know I walked just like a drunken man, they dang near made me fall.
They kept tryin' to steer me back towards Gudger's place, Cuz they still Old George's overalls!
At home before the mirror I seemed to be a different man,
In my mind they kept seein' his farmed out patch o' land.
So I took him back his overalls and a weeks supply of food,
I also left my brand new pair and I sneaked home in the nude.

When you are burdened down with trouble and care (Now brother)
Ring on and on for God will answer your prayer (every prayer)
Three Hebrew children to the flames were thrown
Because a mortal king they would not own
Jesus delivered and the king then saw
Prayer bells of heaven beat the man made law
Prayer bells of heaven oh how sweetly they ring (keep ringin')
Bearing a message unto Jesus our King (Oh Glory)
When you are burdened down with trouble and care (Now brother)

Until His sweat became as blood they say

Bringing salvation for you and me

They did not worry who would go their bail

My heart is bound to break tonight
Western stars light up the sky
Tonight I'm alone to cry, tonight
I watch, I wait
My heart is bound to break tonight
Western stars light up the sky
Hear the desert wind roll by tonight, tonight
Tonight
Tonight

Make my head go spinnin' 'round
Dance me over by that bandstand
'Cause I love that twin fiddle sound
When we're dancin' close cheek to cheek
My head gets woozy and my knees get weak
Waltz me once again 'round that dance floor
Make my head go spinnin' 'round
It's friday night and the joint is swingin'
Inside these swingin' doors
And all the cowpokes they're a dancin'
And slippin' 'round this sawdust floor
But you better watch out who you let cut in
'Cause you might loose your baby to your best friend
Well, waltz me once again 'round that dance floor
Make my head go spinnin' 'round
We spin around, 'round and 'round
Dancin' all night long
The music stopped at three o'clock
But some fool turned that jukebox on
When we're dancin' close cheek to cheek
My head gets woozy and my knees get weak
Waltz me once again 'round that dance floor
Make my head go spinnin' 'round
Waltz me once again 'round the dance floor
We'll dance all night long

Once you laughed at me when I was weeping

Break a heart, break a home
Take a long, hard look at a heaven
Gone to hell under the gun
See the child, young and hungry 
Roamin' wild, on the run
And he'll die reachin' for freedom
He was born under the gun
Swollen men, blind with power
Break the rules one by one
With their lies, raisin' the danger
Of their game, under the gun
No more time, no more chances
No more wars will be won
In the end, only the losers
Hold the land under the gun
Hold the truth like a candle
Let it shine like the sun
On the love that's left to believe in
In a world under the gun

we're gonna be big time before it all ends.

so good that's lasted so long
Well I saw a story in the paper
suddenly the band's big news
the critics all like our records just fine
but they seem a bit confused
seems like everybody cares but us
so just leave us an early wakeup call

Pink and white clouds from a chimney stack 
Red dust and hawks in the wind out back 
And here I am at the Isa 
What do you do in a town like the Isa 
Retrenched at 50 become an old miser 
Drink yourself blind so you're none the wiser 
Sit at home with the race form and whinge 
Just over the hill in his own backyard 
The landscape becomes a picture postcard 
Where the colours are soft but the life is hard 
On the stations here at the Isa 
Tonight's the night of the rodeo ball 
Before riders and bull and horses stand tall 
While out in the park some black people sprawl 
And share their money on flagons 
There's so much more to be understood 
Before coming out here like Robin Hood 
The do-gooders do more harm than good 
Without really knowing the Isa
Through the Leichhardt East Where fools gold flashes
Fossick around for Maltese Crosses 
Flog them off to the tourist buses 
See ghost gums under the moon 
Some really battle some make do 
The luckier ones make a quid and pull through 
Some perch at the bar like a caged cockatoo 
But that's nothing new at the Isa 
And it takes a special kind of girl 
To stay out here in this rugged world 
Keep your dignity when the oathes are hurled 
I pay my respects to you 
And I'll raise my glass to an outback town 
To that weathered spirit that won't back down 
It takes the courage of a rodeo clown 
To stick it out at the Isa 
Big galvanised roofs and monster pipes black 
Pink and white clouds from a chimney stack 
Red dust and hawks in the wind out back 
And here I am at the Isa 
Never thought I'd return to this lonely track 
And here I am back at the Isa

0,Rodeo (ver 3),Garth Brooks,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/garth-brooks/rodeo-chords-3116936,"His eyes are cold and restless
And his wounds have almost healed
And she'd give half of Texas just to change the way he feels
Well she knows his love's in Tulsa
And she knows he's gonna go
Well, it ain't no woman, flesh and blood, it's that damned old rodeo
Well, it's bulls and blood, it's the dust and mud, it's the roar of the Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles, the gold in the buckle he'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps, it's cowboy hats, it's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins, and the joy and the pain, and they call the thing rodeo.
She does her best to hold him
When his love comes to call
But his need for it controls him and her back's against the wall
And it's ""So long, girl, I'll see you.""
When it's time for him to go.
You know the woman wants her cowboy like he wants his rodeo
Well, it's bulls and blood, it's the dust and mud, it's the roar of the Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles, the gold in the buckle he'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps, it's cowboy hats, it's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins, and the joy and the pain, and they call the thing rodeo.
It'll drive a cowboy crazy
It'll drive the man insane
And he'll sell off everything he owns just to pay to play the game
And a broken home and some broken bones
Is all he'll have to show
For all the years that he spent chasin' this dream they call rodeo
Well, it's bulls and blood, it's the dust and mud, it's the roar of the Sunday crowd
It's the white in his knuckles, the gold in the buckle he'll win the next go 'round
It's boots and chaps, it's cowboy hats, it's spurs and latigo
It's the ropes and the reins, and the joy and the pain, and they call the thing rodeo.
It's the broncs and the blood, it's the steers and the mud, and they call the thing rodeo.

Tomorrow comes time to leave.  Well the hills cannot hold back my sorrow forever
Dead men lie deep 'round my door, the only salvation that's mine for the askin'
So mother think on me no more.""
The winter howled high 'round the mountain's breast, and the cold of a thousand snows
Lay heaped upon the forest sleep.  She dressed in Calico.
For a gambler likes his women fancy, fancy she would be
And the fires of her longing would keep 'way the cold, and her dress was a sight to see.
But the road was long beneath her feet, she followed her frozen breath
In search of a certain St. John The Gambler, stumbled to her death.
And she heard his laughter right down from the mountain, danced with her mother's tears
To a funeral drone of Calico,  'neath a cross of twenty years.

  She does the laundry, she keeps him fed
  When she was twenty-one she wore her mother's lace
  She said forever with a smile upon her face
She does the carpool, she PTA's
Doctors and dentists, she drives all day
When she was twenty-nine she delivered number three
And every christmas card showed a perfect family
  Everything runs right on time, years of practice and design
Spit and polish till it shines, he thinks he'll keep her
  Everything is so benign, safest place you'll ever find
God forbid you'd change your mind, he thinks he'll keep her
She packs his suitcase, she sits and waits
With no expression upon her face
When she was thirty-six she met him at the door
She said, ""I'm sorry, I don't love you anymore""
For fifteen years she had a job and not one raise in pay
  Now she's in the typing pool at minimum wage

 Is a reason to believe
 Look deep inside the eyes of a woman

 With just one look I’ve found my salvation

 Is a reason to believe
 Look deep inside the eyes of a woman
 See the man you want to be
 See the man you wanna be,    See the man, see the man you wanna be

And with an old melody and a guitar in hand 
Somewhere between dreaming and weeping 
He'd sing a walk on the wildside lasts a lifetime with me

Mama she gave him no daughters 
Just a look in the eye of a woman in need 
To be free of a love grown harder 
So she hit the road in a Galaxy Ford 
The one that my daddy had bought her 
And she crossed the tracks and never looked back 
She was hummin' a song he had taught her 
She sang a walk on the wildside lasts a lifetime with me 
There was this big black trunk in my father's house 
Where he kept all the ledgers he'd write in 
So  I broke into it before I moved out 
To see if I could find out more about him 
There were letters written, never sent to my mom 
It's a wonder it never killed him 
And there were lines, and songs, and poetry 
Damn near as good as Hank Williams

And he rode for all his horse would ride and I know he done his best
But he crossed over Jordan ridin' Dunny to his death
And we sang, Bringin' in the Sheaves and the Rugged Cross

I am telling you something you ought to know
She may look like a sweet young thing
If you were smart you'd turn around and let her go
That girls' a Barbie doll
She's real good-looking but she's got no heart at all
Puts on her makeup and drives to the bar in her
She's got no idea what she does or why
She does whatever she wants I guess
Whatever comes first or whatever looks best
Nobody I know has ever seen her cry
You should have seen her last Saturday night
She had a friend of mine treating her right
Hanging on him until she found a better deal
You should have seen how cold she got
My buddy asked why and she said why not
Nobody I know swears she's even real

Where a man has pulled over to figure life out
With only his conscience and the lonesome sound
Of diesels winding up grade
He's got a wife and two kids, they love him so
He's got a woman down in Georgia, and she's startin' to show
He's damned if he leaves her, and he's sure damned if he don'tes
And he wonders how life got this way
Cause it's a fine line in between right and wrong
Yeah, he's been crossing over that border way too long
He should'a seen it coming at him right from the start
Now there ain’t no escape from a broken heart
He'll turn his car around tonight, go home and try to face the truth
Everyone involved's getting hurt, now there ain’t nothing he can do

What can a working girl do
But struggle through another day I'll take care   of   you 
Nights are long and dreams are cold 
If they're all you wake up to 
But should you rise with crying eyes I'll take care of  you
So let them talk about us
Let them call us funny things people sometimes do 
I don't care as long as you know I love you and and you know I  do
I'll be there but you might not see me
It's never easy to get through
But when the laughter dies  away then I'll take care of  you

You are on my lonely mind
Into these last nine beers, I have shed a million tears
You are on my lonely mind
I'm gonna keep drinkin' until I'm petrified
And then maybe these tears will leave my eyes
There's a tear in my beer 'cause I'm cryin' for you, dear
You are on my lonely mind
Last night I walked the floor and the night before
You are on my lonely mind
It seems my life is through and I'm so doggone blue
You are on my lonely mind
I'm gonna keep drinkin' 'til I can't move a toe
And then maybe my heart won't hurt me so
There's a tear in my beer 'cause I'm cryin' for you, dear
You are on my lonely mind
Lord, I've tried and I've tried but my tears, I can't hide
You are on my lonely mind
All these blues that I've found have really got me down
You are on my lonely mind
I'm gonna keep drinkin' 'til I can't even think
'Cause in the last week I ain't slept a wink
There's a tear in my beer 'cause I'm cryin' for you, dear
You are on my lonely mind

And every time, I hate to leave your side
But now when I return there's something missing
When I'm gone you don't seem to miss me
Now life's so fast and everything is changing
And if you're changing too, then I don't blame you
I remember how you used to kiss me
But when I'm gone you don't seem to miss me
I'm going back, I wonder why
I'm running fast to get home
I just can't wait to see your face
But you don't seem to miss me
No one can take away the things you've given
And all the good we've had alone together
There was a time when you could not resist me
Now I'm gone, you don't seem to miss me
I'm going back, I wonder why
I'm running fast to get home

But you don't seem to miss me

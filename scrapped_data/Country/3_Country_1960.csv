0,Okie From Muskogee (ver 4),Merle Haggard,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/merle-haggard/okie-from-muskogee-chords-1842382,"We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee;
We don't take no trips on LSD
We don't burn no draft cards down on Main Street;
We like livin' right, and bein' free.
We don't make a party out of lovin'
But we like holdin' hands and pitchin' woo
We don't let our hair grow long and shaggy
Like the hippies out in San Francisco do
I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee,
A place where even squares can have a ball
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse,
And white lightnin's still the biggest thrill of all
Leather boots are still in style for manly footwear;
Beads and Roman sandals won't be seen.
Football's still the roughest thing on campus,
And the kids here still respect the college dean.
And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee,
A place where even squares can have a ball.
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse,
And white lightnin's still the biggest thrill of all.
And white lightnin's still the biggest thrill of all.
In Muskogee, Oklahoma, USA.

I’m standing here, outside the door

But the dawn is breaking, its early morn
The taxi’s waitin, it’s blowin its horn
Already Im so lonesome I could die
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you’ll wait for me
Hold me like you never let me go
Cause Im leaving on a jet plane
Don’t know when I’ll be back again
Oh babe I hate to go
There so many times I’ve let you down
So many times I’ve played around
I tell you now, they don’t mean a thing.
Every place I go I think of you
Every song I sing I sing for you
When I’ll come back I’ll buy you Burger King (or I’LL WEAR YOUR WEDDING RING)
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you’ll wait for me
Hold me like you never let me go
Cause Im leaving on a jet plane
Don’t know when I’ll be back again
Oh babe I hate to go
Well now the time has come to leave you
One more time please let me kiss you
Then close your eyes and I’ll be on my way.
Dream about the days to come
When I won’t have to leave you alone
About the times I won’t have to say
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you’ll wait for me
Hold me like you never let me go

3,Darcy Farrow,John Denver,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-denver/darcy-farrow-chords-66195,"Where the Walker runs down to the Carson Valley plain
There lived a maiden, Darcy Farrow was her name
The daughter of old Dundee, and a fair one was she
The sweetest flower that bloomed o'er the range
Her voice was as sweet as the sugar candy
Her touch was as soft as a bed of goose down
Her eyes shone bright like the pretty lights
That shine in the night out at Yerington town
She was courted by young Vandermeer
A fine lad was he,    as I am to hear
He gave her silver rings and lacy things
He promised to wed before the snows came that year
Her pony did stumble and she did fall
Her dying touched the hearts of us one and all
Young Vandy in his pain put a bullet through his brain
We buried them together as the snows began to fall
They sing of Darcy Farrow where the Truckee runs through
They sing of her beauty in Virginia City too
At dusky sundown to her name they drink a round
And to young Vandy, whose love was true

I was out choppin cotton and my brother was balin' hay
And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat
And Mama hollered out the back door ""y'all remember to wipe your feet
And then she said ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge""
""Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""
And Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas
""Well, Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please""
""There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plow""
And Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow
Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge
And now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge
And Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show
And wasn't I talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?
""I'll have another piece of apple pie, you know it don't seem right""
""I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge""
""And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge""
And Mama said to me ""Child, what's happened to your appetite?""
""I've been cookin' all morning and you haven't touched a single bite""
""That nice young preacher, Brother Taylor, dropped by today""
""Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on Sunday, oh, by the way""
""He said he saw a girl that looked a lot like you up on Choctaw Ridge""
""And she and Billy Joe was throwing somethin' off the Tallahatchie Bridge""
A year has come 'n' gone since we heard the news 'bout Billy Joe
And Brother married Becky Thompson, they bought a store in Tupelo
There was a virus going 'round, Papa caught it and he died last Spring
And now Mama doesn't seem to wanna do much of anything

As soon as you've won your fight to get justice done
Some days, little girl, you'll wonder what life's about
But others have known, few battles are won alone
So you'll look around to find someone who's kind
someone who's fearless like you
The pain of it will ease a bit when you find a man with True Grit
One day you will rise and you won't believe your eyes
You'll wake up and see, a world that is fine and free.

16,Fancy,Bobbie Gentry,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bobbie-gentry/fancy-chords-1666870,"Well, I remember it all very well lookin' back..
it was the summer that I turned eighteen.
We lived in a one-room, run down shack on the 
outskirts of New Orleans.
We didn't have money for food or rent..to say 
the least we was hard-pressed..
when momma spent every last penny we had to buy 
Momma washed and combed and curled my hair..
then she painted my eyes and lips.
Then I stepped into the satin dancin' dress..it had 
a split in the side, clean up to my hip.
It was red, velvet-trimmed and it fit me good.
And standin' back from the lookin' glass was a woman
where a half-growed kid had stood.
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
Lord, forgive me for what I do, but if you want out, 
well, it's up to you.
Now, don't let me down, your momma's gonna you move uptown. 
Momma dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck and she 
kissed my cheek.
Then I saw the tears welling up in her troubled eyes as 
she started to speak.
She looked at our pitiful shack and then she looked at me 
and took a ragged breath..she said, your Pa's runned off 
and I'm real sick and the baby's gonna starve to death.
She handed me a heart-shaped locket that said, to thine own 
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across the toe of 
It sounded like somebody else was talkin' askin', Momma what 
do I do?
She said, just be nice to the gentlemen, Fancy, they'll be nice 
to you.
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
Lord, forgive me for what I do, but if you want out, 
well, it's up to you.
Get up, now, girl, you best be movin' uptown.
Well, that was the last time I saw my momma, when I left that rickety 
The welfare people came and took the baby, momma died and I ain't 
But the wheels of fate had started to turn and for me there was 
It wasn't very long after, that I knew exactly what my momma was 
I knew what I had to do, but I made myself this solemn vow..
that I was gonna to be a lady someday, though I didn't know when or how.
But I couldn't see spendin' the rest of my life with my head hung 
down in shame.
I mighta been born just plain white trash but Fancy was my name.
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
It wasn't long after that a benevolent man took me in off the streets.
One week later I was pourin' his tea in a five roomed penthouse suite.
I've charmed a king, a congressman and an occasional aristocrat.
And I got me a Georgia mansion and a New York townhouse flat..
now, I ain't done bad.
Now, in this world there's a lot of self-righteous hypocrites who call 
me bad.
They criticize momma for turning me out, no matter how little we had.
But I haven't had to worry 'bout nothin', now for nigh on fifteen years.
But I can still hear the desperation in my poor momma's voice ringin' in 
my ears.
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down.
Lord, forgive me for what I do, but if you want out, 
well, it's up to you.
Now, don't let me down, your momma's gonna help you move uptown.

Plowing through the ragged sky and up a cloudy draw

Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
For he saw the Riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry

On horses snorting fire
As they ride on hear their cry

    Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge.""

    ""Oh, Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please.
    There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plough.""

    ”Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge,
    and now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge.”

    put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show.

There's a door without any key
Somewhere between your heart and mine 
There's a love I can't understand
It's there for a while then it fades like a smile 
And I'm left in the middle again
There's a wall so high it reaches the sky 
Somewhere between me and you

44,Mr Shorty (ver 2),Marty Robbins,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/marty-robbins/mr-shorty-chords-1935993,"Nobody knew where he came from
They only knew he came in
Slowly he walked to the end of the bar
And he ordered up one slug of gin
Well, I could see that he wasn't a large man
I could tell that he wasn't too tall
I judged him to be 'bout five foot three
And his voice was a soft Texas drawl
Said he was needin' some wages
'Fore he could ride for the west
Said he could do most all kind of work
Said he could ride with the best
There in his blue eyes was sadness
That comes from the need of a friend
And tho' he tried, he still couldn't hide
The loneliness there, deep within
Said he would work through the winter
For thirty a month and his board
I started to say where he might land a job
When a fellow came in through the door
And I could tell he was lookin' for trouble
From the way that he came stompin' in
He told me to leave Shorty there by himself
Come down and wait on a man
The eyes of the little man narrowed
The smile disappeared from his face
Gone was the friendliness that I had seen
And a wild look of hate took its place
But the big one continued to mock him
And he told me that I'd better go
Find him a couple of glasses of milk
And then maybe Shorty would grow
When the little man spoke, there was stillness
He made sure that everyone heard
Slowly he stepped away from the bar
And I still remember these words
""Oh, it's plain that you're lookin' for trouble
Trouble's what I try to shun
If that's what you want, then that's what you'll get
Cause cowboy, we're both packin' guns""
His hand was already positioned
His feet wide apart on the floor
I hadn't noticed but there on his hip
Was a short-barreled bat .44
It was plain he was ready and waitin'
He leaned a bit forward and said
""When you call me Shorty, say Mister, my friend
Maybe you'd rather be dead""
In the room was a terrible silence
As the big one stepped out on the floor
All drinkin' stopped and the tick of the clock
Said death would wait ten seconds more
He cursed once or twice in a whisper
And he said with a snarl on his lips
""Nobody's Mister to me, little man!""
And he grabbed for the gun on his hip
But the little man's hand was like lightning
The bat .44 was the same
The .44 spoke and it sent lead and smoke
And seventeen inches of flame
For the big one had never cleared leather
Beaten before he could start
A little round hole had appeared on his shirt
The bullet went clear through his heart
The little man stood there a moment
Then holstered the bat .44
""It's always this way so I never stay""
Slowly he walked out the door
Nobody knew where he came from
They won't forget he came by
They won't forget how a .44 gun
One night made the difference in size
As for me, I'll remember the sadness
Shown in the eyes of the man
If we meet someday, you can bet I would say
That it's me, Mr. Shorty, your friend

45,Yesterday When I Was Young,Roy Clark,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/roy-clark/yesterday-when-i-was-young-chords-2766754,"It seems the love I've known
Has always been the most destructive kind
I guess that's why now
I feel so old
Before my time
Yesterday when I was young
the taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
the way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned
I always built to last on weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day
and only now I see how the years ran away
Yesterday when I was young
so many happy songs were waiting to be sung,
so many wild pleasures lay in store for me
and so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think what life was all about
and every conversation I can now recall
concerned itself with me and nothing else at all
Yesterday the moon was blue
and every crazy day brought something new to do
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
and never saw the waste and emptiness beyond
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
and every flame I lit too quickly quickly died
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
and only I am left on stage to end the play
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
The time has come for me to pay for yesterday when I was young

Going down, down, down,
My mind is a blank,
My head is spinning around and around,
As I go deep into the funnel of love.
It's such a crazy, crazy feeling,
I get weak in the knees,
My poor old head is a reelin',
As I go deep into the funnel of love.

And I watched our little girl outside at play
with the little boy next door.
Like so many times before
But somethin' didn't seem quite right today
So I went outside to see what they were doin'
And then the tear drops made my eyes grow dim.
'Cause I heard him name the game
And I hung my head in shame
When I heard our little girl say to him
I don't wanna play house,
I know it can't be fun;
I watched Mommy and Daddy
And if that's the way it's done,
I don't wanna play house
It makes my Mommy cry
Cause when she played house my Daddy said goodbye
I don't wanna play house,
I know it can't be fun;
I watched Mommy and Daddy
And if that's the way it's done,
I don't wanna play house
It makes my Mommy cry
Cause when she played house my Daddy said goodbye

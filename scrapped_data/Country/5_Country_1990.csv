0,Id Be Better Off In A Pine Box,Doug Stone,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/doug-stone/id-be-better-off-in-a-pine-box-chords-860795,"I said the night you left me
Nothin’ worse could ever happen,
But seeing you with someone else
Proved that I was wrong.
And when your eyes met mine, I knew
That you were gone forever,
Along with all the reasons I had for hanging on.
I’d be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back to Georgia,
Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time.
I think I’d rather die and go to hell and face the devil,
Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind.
I always thought that someday, we might get back together.
I just thought you needed time
To spread your wings and fly,
But when I saw the loving way you held onto each other,
It was all that I could do, not to break right down and cry
I’d be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back to Georgia,
Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time.
I think I’d rather die and go to hell and face the devil,
Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind.
I’d be better off in a pine box
On a slow train back to Georgia,
Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time.
I think I’d rather die and go to hell and face the devil,
Than to lie here with you and him together on my mind.
I can't lie here with you and him together on my mind.

1,Time Marches On (ver 2),Tracy Lawrence,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tracy-lawrence/time-marches-on-chords-1737638,"Sister cries out from her baby bed
Brother runs in  feathers on his head
Momma's in a room  learning how to sew
Daddy's drinking beer listening to the radio
Hank Williams sings ""Kaw-Liga"" and ""Dear John""
Time marches on, Time marches on
Sister's wearin' rouge and clear complexion soap
Brother's wearin' beads and he smokes a lot of dope
Momma is depressed, barely makes a sound
Daddy's got a girlfriend in another town
Bob Dylan sings ""Like a Rolling Stone""
and time marches on, time marches on
The south moves north, the north moves south
A star is born, a star burns out
The only thing that stays the same is
Everything changes, everything changes
Sister calls herself sexy grandma
Brother's on a diet high cholesterol
Momma's out of touch with reality
Daddy's in the ground beneath the maple tree
While the angels sing an old Hank Williams song
Time marches on, time marches on
Time marches on, time marches on  
Time marches on, time marches on(Spoken)

  I watch the sunlight dance across   your face
And I've     never been this swepted away
  All my thoughts just seem to settle on the    breeze
  When I'm lying rapped up in your arms
  The whole world just fades away the only         thing
I hear is the beating of your heart
'Cause I can feel you breathe 'cause watching over me
and suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
And baby all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch slow and steady rush
Baby isn't that the way that love's suppose to be
 I can feel you breathe            just breathe  
  In a way I know my heart is waking    up
  As all the walls come tumbling down
  Closer than I've ever felt before and I know
And you know there's no need for words right now
'Cause I can feel you breathe 'cause watching over me

Before they knocked down the timber and they strip-mined the coal
When you rose in the mornin' before it was light
To go down in that dark hole and come back up at night
I was born on this mountain, this mountain's my home
And she holds me and keeps me from worry and woe
Well, they took everything that she gave, now they're gone
But I'll die on this mountain, this mountain's my home
I was young on this mountain but now I am old
And I knew every holler, every cool swimmin' hole
Till one night I lay down and woke up to find
That my childhood was over and I went down in the mine
I was born on this mountain, this mountain's my home
And she holds me and keeps me from worry and woe
Well, they took everything that she gave, now they're gone
But I'll die on this mountain, this mountain's my home
There's a hole in this mountain and it's dark and it's deep
And God only knows all the secrets it keeps
There's a chill in the air only miners can feel
There're ghosts in the tunnels that the company sealed
I was born on this mountain, this mountain's my home
And she holds me and keeps me from worry and woe
Well, they took everything that she gave, now they're gone
But I'll die on this mountain, this mountain's my home

  Hot soup on a campfire under the bridge
  Shelter line stretchin' round the corner   . . . .
  Welcome to the new world order
  Families sleepin' in their cars in the Southwest  . . . .
  No home, no job, no peace, no rest

  Preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag
  Waitin' for when the last shall be first 
  And the first shall be last   . . . .
  In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass
  You got a one-way ticket to the promised land   . . . .
  You got a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
  Sleeping on a pillow of solid rock   . . . .
  Bathin' in the city's aqueduct

  Now you wear your skin like iron,
Your breath as hard as kerosene
  You weren't your mama's only boy, but her favorite one it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye,
And sank into your dreams
  Pancho was a bandit boy, his horse was fast as polished steel
  He wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
  Pancho met his match you know on the deserts down in Mexico
And nobody heard his dying words, ah but that's the way it goes
  All the Federales say they could have had him any day
  They only let him slip away out of kindness, I suppose
  Lefty, he can't sing the blues all night long like he used to.
  The dust that Pancho bit down south ended up in Lefty's mouth
  The day they laid poor Pancho low, Lefty split for Ohio
   Where he got the bread to go, there ain't nobody knows
  All the Federales say could have had him any day
  We only let him slip away out of kindness, I suppose
  The poets tell how Pancho fell, and Lefty's living in a cheap hotel
  The desert's quiet and Cleveland's cold,
  And so the story ends we're told
  Pancho needs your prayers it's true, but save a few for Lefty too
  He only did what he had to do, and now he's growing old

""Daddy there's a lot that I don't know
But don't you ever dream about a life
Where corn don't grow?""

Staring at his favorite coffee cup
I saw a storm of mixed emotions in his eyes
When he looked up
He said ""son I know at your age
It seems like this ole world is turnin' slow
And you think you'll find the answer to it all
Where corn don't grow.""
Hard times are real
There's dusty fields no matter where you go
You may change your mind
Cause the weeds are high where corn don't grow

When Daddy turned and walked back in the house
I was only 17 back then
But I thought that I knew more than I know now
I can't say he didn't warn me
This city life's a hard row to hoe
Ain't it funny how a dream can turn around

there was a party goin on when I got there
I heard a welcome speech from a small town mayor
He said we got 100 gallons of sweet red wine
made from the biggest watermelons on the vine
help yourself to some but obey the law       
if you drink don't drive do the Watermelon Crawl

Said let me show you something that you ain't never seen
she grabbed me by the arm said c'mon let's go         
she dipped down spun around and do-si-do'd
She rocked back on her heels dropped down to her knees
crawled across the floor then she jumped back to her feet
she wiggled and she jiggled - beat all you ever saw

You slide a little bit close as we, drove down to the lake road,
and watched the sun fade in that big red sky.
I reached under the front seat and said, now here's something special.
It's just been waitin', for a night like tonight, but -
There might be, a little dust on the bottle,
but don't let it fool ya, about what's inside.
There might be, a little dust on the bottle,
it's just one of those things, that gets sweeter with time.
You're still with me, we'll make some memories,
after all these years there's one - thing - I've found.
Some say good love, it's like a fine wine,
it keeps gettin' better, as the days roll by  . . . but
There might be, a little dust on the bottle,
but don't let it fool ya, about what's inside.
There might be, a little dust on the bottle,
it's just one of those things, that gets sweeter with time.

Take a walk, just a little ways,
And as we walked, along  we talked
Of when would be,   our wedding day.
And only say, that you'll be mine,
In no o  thers arms entwined,
Down beside where the waters flow,
Down by the banks of the Ohio.
I asked her if she'd marry me,
And my wife forever be,
She only turned her head away
And had no other words to say.
And only say, that you'll be mine,
In no o  thers arms entwined,
Down beside where the waters flow,
Down by the banks of the Ohio.
I plunged a knife into her breast,
And told her she was going to rest,
She cried 'Oh Willie, don't murder me,
I'm not prepared for eternity.'
I took her by her golden curls,
And drug her down to the riverside,
And there I pushed her into drown,
And I watched her as she floated down.
And only say, that you'll be mine,
In no o  thers arms entwined,
Down beside where the waters flow,
Down by the banks of the Ohio.
And going home between twelve and one,
And cried 'Oh Lord, What have I done,
I've killed the only girl I love,
Because she would not marry me.
And only say, that you'll be mine,
In no o  thers arms entwined,
Down beside where the waters flow,
Down by the banks of the Ohio.

Pretty lights are red and blue
But they shut down all the honkytonks tonight
Say a prayer or two if they only knew
You used to say the highway was your home
But we both know that ain't true
It's just the only place a man can go
When he don't know where he's travelin to
But Colorado's always clean and healing
And Tennessee in Spring is green and cool
It never really was your kind of town
But you went around with the Forth Worth Blues
Somewhere up beyond the great divide
Where the sky is wide and the clouds are few
A man can see his way clear to the light
Just hold on tight that's all you gotta do
And they say Texas weather's always changin'
And one thing change'll bring is somethin' new
And Houston really ain't that bad a town
So you hang around with the Ft. Worth Blues
There's a full moon over Galway Bay tonight
Silver light over green and blue
And every place I travel through I find
Some kind of a sign that you've been through
But Amsterdam was always good for grieving
And London never fails to leave me blue
And Paris never was my kind of town
So I walked around with the Ft. Worth Blues

Stared out at the dusty fields where daddy always worked hard eveyday
I think it kind of hurt him when i said ""Daddy there's a lot that i don't know
But don't you ever dream about a life where corn don't grow""
He just sat there silent staring in his favorite coffee cup
I saw a storm of mixed emotions in his eyes when he looked up
He said ""Son i know at your age it feels like this ol' world is turning slow
And you think you'll find the answer to it all,where corn don't grow""
Hard times are real,there's dusty fields
No matter where you go
You may change your mind,'cause the weeds are high
Where corn don't grow
I remember feeling guilty when daddy turned and walked back in the house
I was only seventeen back then but it seems like i knew more than i do now
I can't say he didn't tell me this city life's a hard row to hoe
It's funny how a dream can turn around,where corn don't grow
   You may change your mind,'cause the weeds are high
Where corn don't grow

0,Day After Day,Darrell Scott,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/darrell-scott/day-after-day-chords-2080475,"Dad never started drinking
And once he found the power 
Go outside and catch a cricket,
Said their singing kept him company,
when we'd leave him alone
Those were days of feeling awkward,
Hoping I could find some comfort,
I'd spend time out in the desert
And we'd talk about leaving, 
but it was years before we did
Oh the time moves slow
But you can't go where you want to go
But, oh the time slips away
Day after day, day after day
Well I found myself a genie,
And all I had to do for her
was love her endlessly
So I asked my dad about it and he said,
So I closed my eyes, held her and said, 
   ""Take me away""
Let's live in a lighthouse
And we'll hang a wreath to loneliness
But we never made the ocean,
She said the day she left,
you know, I really thought you knew
Oh the time moves slow
But you can't go where you want to go
But, oh the time slips away
Day after day, day after day
Well I went back home to see my dad,
To his photographs of Hank and Johnny,
Hank had a hole shot through his mouth
There were crickets in hallway
and Dad awake in bed
He was sitting in the darkness
Said he went a little crazy
I never asked him about the pictures
He shot 'em for the life
and the man he wouldn't be
Oh the time moves slow
And you can't go where you want to go
But, oh the time slips away
Day after day, day after day
Oh the time moves slow
And you can't go where you want to go
But, oh the time slips away
Day after day, day after day

1,Songs About Rain (verÂ 2),Gary Allan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/gary-allan/songs-about-rain-chords-880187,"(4 measures of just strumming sans lyrics)
Well this town has closed down way too early and there's nothing to do,
so I'm drivin' around in circles and I'm thinkin' about you.
 Today I heard you got a new last name.  
 Sure didn't know it was gonna hit me this way,
And the radio just keeps on playin' all these songs about rain.
Now there's all kinds of songs about babies and love that goes right,
But for some unknown reasons nobody wants to play them tonight.
 Hey I hope it's sunny wherever you are,
 but that's sure not the picture tonight in my car.
And it sure ain't easin my pain, all these songs like...
Rainy Night in Georgia, and Kentucky Rain,
Here Comes that Rainy Day Feelin Again,
Blue Eyes Cryin' In The Early Mornin' Rain,
They go on and on and there's no two the same.
Oh it would be easy to blame all these songs about rain.
Well I thought I was over you but I guess maybe I'm not,
'Cause when I let you go, looks like lonely is all that I got.
 Guess I'll never know what could have been.
 Sure ain't helpin' this mood that I'm in,
If they're gonna keep on playin' me songs like...
Rainy Night in Georgia, and Kentucky Rain,
Here Comes that Rainy Day Feelin Again,
Blue Eyes Cryin' In The Early Mornin' Rain,
They go on and on there's no two the same.
Oh how I wish I could blame all these songs about rain.

2,Devils Right Hand,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/devils-right-hand-chords-1170022,"Well about the time my daddy left to fight the big war
Saw my first pistol in the general store
In the general store when I was thirteen
Thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen
I asked if I could have one when I grew up
Mama dropped a dozen eggs and she really blew up
She really blew up and I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the Devil's right hand
She really blew up and I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the Devil's right hand
The Devil's right hand, the Devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol is the Devil's right hand
My very first pistol was a cap 'n' ball Colt
Shoots as fast as lightning but it loads a might slow
It loads a might slow and I soon found out
It can get you into trouble but it can't get you out
Then I went and bought myself a Colt .45
Called a ""Peacemaker"" but I didn't know why
I never knew why and I didn't understand
'Cause Mama said the pistol is the Devil's right hand
I never knew why and I didn't understand
Mama said the pistol is the Devil's right hand
The Devil's right hand, the Devil's right hand
Mama said the pistol is the Devil's right hand
I got into a card game in a company town
Caught a minor cheatin' and I shot the dog down
Shot the dog down, watched the dog fall
Never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw
The Trial was in the morning and they drug me out of bed
Asked me how I pleaded, not guilty I said
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man
Nothin' touched the trigger but the Devil's right hand
Not guilty I said, you've got the wrong man
Nothin' touched the trigger but the Devil's right hand

Things got bad,  things got worse  I guess you know the tune
Oh lord, stuck in Lodi again   
The man from the magazine  Said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connection,  ran out of songs to play
Came into town on a one night stand,  looks like my plans fell through
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again
And I rode in on a grey hound  I'll be walking out if I go
I was just passing through  Must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money  Looks like they took my friends
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again  
If I only had a dollar,  for every song I sung
And everytime I had to play,  while people sat there drunk
You know I'd catch the next train,  back to where I live

From climbing your tree

Pushed up against the sea
Finally back to me
I'm assuming you got my message
On your machine
I'm assuming you love me

Where, wild in the woodlands, the primroses blow;
There oft, as mild evening sweeps over the lea,
The sweet-scented birk shades my Mary and me.

And winds by the cot where my Mary resides;
How wanton thy waters her snowy feet lave,
As, gathering sweet flowerets, she stems thy clear wave.

Wait by the door and light a cigarette

And he ain't seen me crazy yet

His fist is big but my gun is bigger 
He'll find out when I pull the trigger

That's what I was when I first left home
I took every secret that I'd ever known
and headed for the wall       Like a wrecking ball
Started down the holy road of sin
Playin' bass under a pseudonym
The days were rough and it's all quite dim
but my mind cuts through it all       Like a wrecking ball
I     was just a little deadhead       Who's watching, who is watching
I     was just a little deadhead       Fallen daughter on a scholarship
Well, I got tired and let my average slip
Then I's a farmer in the Pogonip
with the weed that I recall      was like a wrecking ball
Met a lovesick daughter of the San Joaquin
She showed me colors I'd never seen
Drank the bottom out of my canteen
then left in the fall      like a wrecking ball
Standin' there in the morning mist
Tug the coat at the end of my wrist
Yes, I remember when first we kissed
though it was nothing at all       like a wrecking ball
Hey boys,      a little deadhead       Who's watching, who is watching
I     was just a little deadhead       
Too much trouble for me to shake
Oh, the weather and the blindin' ache
was riding high till the '89 quake
hit the Santa Cruz Garden Mall       like a wrecking ball

44,The Man Comes Around (verÂ 2),Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/the-man-comes-around-chords-397909,"There's a man going around taking names
and he decides who to free and who to blame
every body won't be treated all the same
there will be a golden ladder reaching down
When the man comes around
The hairs on your arm will stand up
at the terror in each sip and each sup
will you partake of that last offered cup
Or disappear into the potter's ground
When the man comes around
Hear the trumpets hear the pipers
one hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling and voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
Its alpha and omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
Till Armageddon no shalam no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chickens home
The wise man will bow down before the throne
and at his feet they will cast the golden crowns
When the man comes around
Whoever is unjust let him be unjust to
Whoever is righteous let him be righteous to
Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down
When the man comes around
Hear the trumpets hear the pipers
one hundred million angels singing
Multitudes are marching to the big kettledrum
Voices calling and voices crying
Some are born and some are dying
Its alpha and omega's kingdom come
And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree
The virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind is in the thorn tree
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
In measured hundred weight and penny pound
When the man comes around

He'd been praying for a little baby boy...
Someone he could take fishing
Throw the football and be his pride and joy..
He could already see him holding that trophy
Taking his team to state
But when the nurse came in with a little pink blanket
All those big dreams changed
And now, he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet, little, 
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect, all American girl
Sixteen short years later
She was falling for the senior football star
Before you knew it he was dropping passes
Skipping practice just to spend more time with her
The coach said, hey son what is your problem
Tell me have you lost your mind
Daddy said you'll lose your free ride to college
Boy, you better tell her goodbye
And now, he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet, little, 
Beautiful, wonderful, perfect, all American
And when they got married 
And decided to have one of their own
She said, be honest, tell me what you want
And he said, honey you outta know
A sweet, little, beautiful,  one just like you
I want a beautiful, wonderful, perfect all American
And now, he's wrapped around her finger
She's the center of his whole world
And his heart belongs to that sweet, little,

suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me
I heard it today and couldn't help but sing along
 cause everytime I hear that song
I go back to a two tone short bed Chevy
Drivin my first love out to the levy
Livin life with no sense of time
And I go back to the field of a fifty yard line
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks
 Everytime I hear that song, 
I go back,  I go back
I use to rock all night long to keep on rockin my baby
Frat parties, college bars just tryin to impress the ladies,
I heard it today and couldn't help but sing along
 cause everytime I hear that song
I go back to the smell of an old gym floor,
And the taste of salt on a Carolina shore,
After graduation and drinkin goodbye to friends,
And I go back to watchin summer fade to fall,
Growin up to fast and I do recall,
Wishin time would stop right in its tracks,
 Everytime I hear that song, 
I go back,   I go back,
We all, have a song that somehow stamped our lives,
Takes us to another place  and time,
So I go back to the pew, Preacher and a chior,
Singin about God, bimestone and fire,
And the smell of Sunday chicken after church,
And I go back to the loss of a real good friend,
And the sixteen summers a sharin with him
Now ""Only the good die young"" stops me in my tracks,
 Everytime I hear that song, 
I go back,   I go back,
To the field of a fifty yard line,
A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine,
I go back, (I go back)
To watchin summer fade to fall,
Growin up to fast and I do recall,
I go back, (I go back)
To the loss of a real good friend,

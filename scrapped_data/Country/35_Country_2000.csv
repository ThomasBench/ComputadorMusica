The local hotel ghosts blow back around
Descend on those drugstore cowboy nights
Cling to the bar, then disappear from sight
Back to the daily regime
Where the late night graveyard shift dampens your dreams
Bitten by the desire and the spell
That leaves you stranded out  On the other side of town

I could write another fight song, yeah, but there's got to be something to be proud of and they say
Misery love's company, but it damn sure ain't lookin' for me
I'll be alright, I just gotta find someone to break my heart tonight
Going out walkin' on Avenue B and I ain't comin' back until dawn
And find some stranger in a Greenich bar to shower my affection upon
Well maybe she'll stay 'til one fateful day when we realize we've got nothin' left
And maybe I'll find she's messed up my mind and I can get back to doing what I do best and they say

Like the one about your father stealing stars out of the sky,
And if I could buy you just one more drink, I think I'd have the strength to tell these lies.
And it must feel so fine to get what you want every time.
I would if I were more like James Dean.

When I hear you stop and laugh out loud,
When you're fallin' fast asleep.
When you're in the middle of a crowd,
When you're lyin' close to me.
When I hear you softly say my name,
When you're high and when you're low.
You don't need me to explain,
'Cause you already know.
When you smile that way,
I know, every night and day.
That's when I love you, when I need you,
When I care about you.
That's when I know without a doubt,
That I can't live without you.
Everyday I find another reason,
Every season we go through,
And every little thing you do,
That's when I love       you.
When you're drivin' in your car,
When you dance and sing to the radio.
When you're walkin' underneath the stars,
Anywhere and everywhere you go.
When you're dressed up or you're dressed down,
When you're talkin' on the phone.
With a million people all around,
Or when you're all alone.
When you're near, or you're far,
You're in my heart no matter where you are.
That's when I love you, when I need you,
When I care about you.
That's when I know without a doubt,
That I can't live without you.
Everyday I find another reason,
Every season we go through,
And every little thing you do,
That's when I love       you.

And as hard as we try we just cant stop thinking
Dirt in my fist roots on my sleeve

People like me like people like you
Cause people like you are far too few
Oh night and daylight had got nothing on you
And nothing's everlasting when your always just passing through

Ear full of music just when I need it
Your soul wont sing unless you bleed it
Lookin for answers through the night owl window

One foot on Jacob's ladder and one foot in the fire
And it all goes down in your mind
Livin' at the bottom of the stairs of life; never a smile knockin' on your door.
The air is blue and so are you, prehistoric monsters on the floor.
Last verse of your last song and God don't hear dead men.
The end of the line is in your mind, then you'll be stayin' in.
In your mind, in your mind.
Bone for bone and skin for skin; eye for eye and tooth for tooth;
Heart for heart and soul for soul. Somebody said ""What is truth""?
Lock it up and close it down. The sound of mournin' like a dove,
High beyond the rattlin' roar, lookin' to the face of love.
In your mind In your mind,; it all goes down in your mind.
One foot on Jacob's ladder and one foot in the fire
And it all goes down in your mind
In your mind, in your mind.
Sunday words are back again and you eat your fundamentalist pie
but just a piece you understand; you get the rest up in the sky.
Praise and glory, wounded angels shufflin' 'round the room.
Eternity is down the hall and you sit there bendin' spoons.
In your mind, in your mind.
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Sacrificial drops of pain
on a silver plated cross; sanctification on a chain.
Thay say redemption draweth nigh; the storms of silence from above
stop your ears and close your eyes and try to find the face of love
In your mind In your mind,; it all goes down in your mind.
One foot on Jacob's ladder and one foot in the fire
And it all goes down in your mind
In your mind In your mind,; it all goes down in your mind.

A Saviour in her dreams.
   But she was not delivered then,
And the baby became me.
There's a light inside the darkened room,
A footstep on the stairs.
   A door that I forever close,
To leave those memories there.
  So when the shadows link them,
  Into an evening sun.
Well first there's summer, then I'll let you in.
September when it comes.
I plan to crawl outside these walls,
Close my eyes and see.
   And fall into the heart and arms,
Of those who wait for me.
I cannot move a mountain now;
I can no longer run.
  I cannot be who I was then:
In a way, I never was.
   I watch the clouds go sailing;
   I watch the clock and sun.
Oh, I watch myself, depending on,
September when it comes.
   So when the shadows link them,
   And burn away the clouds.
They will fly me, like an angel,
To a place where I can rest.
When this begins, I'll let you know,
September when it comes.

And letting go like a levee breaks

Or built to fade like your favorite song   
Get reckless when there's no need   
Laugh as your stories ramble on   
Break my heart, but it won't bleed   
My only friends are pirates   
That's just who I am   
But I'm better as a memory than as your man   
Never sure when the truth won't do   
I'm pretty good on a lonely night   
I move on the way a storm blows through   
I never stay, but then again, I might.   
I struggle sometimes to find the words   
Always sure until I doubt   
Walk a line until it blurs   
Build walls too high to climb out   
But I'm honest to a fault   
That's just who I am   
I'm better as a memory than as your man   
I see you leaning, you're bound to fall   
I don't want to be that mistake   
I'm just a dreamer and nothing more   
You should know it before it gets too late
Cause goodbyes are like a roulette wheel   
You never know where they're gonna land   
First you're spinning, then you're standing still   
Left holding a losing hand   
But one day you're gonna find someone   
And right away you'll know it's true   
That all of your sinking's done   
It was just a part of the passing through   
Right there in that moment you'll finally understand   
That I was better as a memory than as your man   
Better as a memory than as your man

I've made it seven years still I don't know how I did
I come from a long line of live and love in vain

Making you heart sees something that’s just not there
Why does love got to be so unkind
Making you hurt so bad no it’s just not right
Why does love got to be soooohoouuuoooo unfair        oooohhh
It’s a sad fact it’s the cold hard truth
Sometimes your gonna learn that love is cruel
Sometimes your gonna find out
Gonna find the one you love
Why does love got to be so unfair

Making you hurt so bad no it’s just not right

One saturday evenin when all the work was done
We went down to the river we had some trot lines to run
My brother walter had a fight the week before
Knocked a boy named wilson through the pool hall door
They said you dont mess with wilson unless you want a war
I put the boat in the water and i made the engine run
I loaded the lantern against the sinking sun
And my brother walter was loading his gun
And we went down the river
Down past the coal docks we were running our lines
Heard some drunken boaters racing up behind
It was wilson and his cousin they had trouble on their minds
They passed on by us probably going to tend their pots
We headed up the river with the fish we'd caught
But before we made the landing i thought i heard a shot
Back down the river
My brother walter fell over the side
And i couldnt find him no matter how i tried
And i looked along the bank but i couldnt find where they'd hide
They drug the river they searched it up and down
Couldnt find his body so they decided that he'd drowned
But i knew better cause wilson bragged around town
So one night i floated down right above wilsons shack
I hid in the woods untill i saw him walk out back
I put a bullet in his head and dropped him in his tracks
Then we went down the river
Down below the trestle where the water runs slow
I chained him to an anvil then i let him go
And five years later well i aint told a soul
And i aint done much fishin i hardly wet a line
The death of my brother is still heavy on my mind
I've been thinking wilsons cousin better find a place to hide
Cause i'm goin down the river yeah i'm goin down the river

Seeds and dirt, a prayer for rain that I can use.

I see the seasons come and go
Sending rain, fire, and snow.
I'm at the mercy of it all, this life I choose.
Sometimes I hang my head and cry
When that evening train comes by.
I wish it could take me far away
These farmer's blues. 
The tractor's old, the fence is down
Put on my suit and go to town.
I ask for a loan and I know well they might refuse
Back at home, still by my side
The one I love, with worried eyes
Waits for me to love away, these farmer's blues.

I woke up early with a pounding in my head
I'd been out the night before with all my friends
A little worried, kinda wondering what I did
I said, Lord please forgive me for my sins
My wife wanted to kill me but she tried to save me first
You're goin' if I have to drag your butt to church
I love this crazy tragic, sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life
I read the hymns and kinda sorta sang along
Made it through the Sunday sermon wide awake
We met the family for dinner at our home
Drank some beer, watched the game and cooked some steak
My little brother had a big fight with his wife
And our poor mother sat between em both all night
I love this crazy tragic, sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life
We said a prayer for cousin Michael in Iraq
We're all aware that he may never make it back
We talked about the way we missed his stupid jokes
And how he loved to be a soldier more than most
I lay in bed that night and thought about the day
And how my life is like a roller-coaster ride
The ups and downs and crazy turns along the way
It'll throw you off if you don't hold on tight
You can't really smile until you shed some tears
I could die today or I might live on for years
I love this crazy tragic, sometimes almost magic
Awful, beautiful life

And I'll be coming back real soon to longhorns saloon
So Alex can pour me a beer 
In the stockyards its my backyard that's where I grew up

William Roberts will surly suffice
And if your not sure just drink one more
She'll look better I swear
Cause I was given birth in south fort worth
That's where I'll live and die
In the stockyards its my backyard that's where I grew up
Not sure where you are it could be PR's
I've been lost there myself
Two steps from my pillow the shut down armadillo
I stopped off and bought one round 
In the stockyards its my backyard that's where I grew up
Its were I drank my first beer I cried my first tear
On the corner of north and main
In the stockyards its my backyard that's where I grew up

Shotgun on my shoulder
Where a tote sack oughta be

I'll drag them back to the field they should be dead by then
Wipe the sweat off my neck and tally ho the plow
I'm gonna grow a woman from the ground
The night was a chalkboard with a fingernail moon
If the fish ain't dead yet they will be pretty soon
Kinda like the feeling at an old folks home
Even though you love them you can't wait for them to go
I'll call her Angelina she's a teacher I once had
A halo of honey wrapped around her head
And she always used to give me some when I was a kid
I told her that I loved her and then I went and hid
I'll take you into town and I'll show you off
And there's room on your dress for a corsage
And I'll open up every door for you
I opened up my almanac and in my head I read
Cut your wrist on the fins of the fish and drain all you can
So I rolled up my sleeves and then began to draw lines just as deep as the
days are long
I sewed up my wrist and sewed the ground with my blood
Stained up my clothes pretty good and I turned that dirt to mud
I couldn't help but close my eyes and lay my body down
'Cause I heard it takes forever to grow a woman from the ground
I bleed for you now and I'm skinny as a rail
And I'll be so obliged to keep you nice and warm and safe
and won't you be so proud of me

48,Lovesick Blues,Ryan Adams,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ryan-adams/lovesick-blues-chords-1083907,"   I got a feelin' called the blu-ues, oh, Lawd
   Since my baby said good-bye
   And I don't know what I'll do-oo-oo
   All I do is sit and sigh-igh, oh, Lawd
   That last long day she said good-bye
   Well Lawd I thought I would cry
   She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of lovin'
   Lawd, I love to hear her when she calls me
   Sweet dad-ad-ad-dy, such a beautiful dream
   I hate to think it all o-o-ver
   I've lost my heart it seems
   I've grown so used to you some-how
   Well, I'm nobody's sugar-daddy now
   And I'm lo-on-lonesome
   I got the Lovesick Blu-ues.
   Well, I'm in love, I'm in love, with a beautiful gal
   That's what's the matter with me
   Well, I'm in love, I'm in love, with a beautiful gal   
   But she don't care about me
   Lawd, I tried and I tried, to keep her satisfied
   But she just wouldn't stay
   So now that she is lea-eav-in'
   This is all I can say.
   I got a feelin' called the blu-ues, oh, Lawd

0,Fox On The Run,Tom T. Hall,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tom-t-hall/fox-on-the-run-chords-3633401,"She walks through the corn leadin down to the river
Her hair shone like gold in the hot morning sun
She took all the love that this poor boy could give her
And left me to die like a fox on the run
Like a fox, Like a fox, Like a fox on the run
Now everybody knows the reason for the fall
When woman tempted man down in paradise hall
This woman tempted me then she took me for a  ride
But, like a weary fox, boys I  need a  place to hide
She walks through the corn leadin down to the river
Her hair shone like gold in the hot morning sun
She took all the love that this poor boy could give her
And left me to die like a fox on the run
Like a fox, Like a fox, Like a fox on the run
We’ll drink a glass of wine boys to fortify our souls
We’ll talk about the world and friends we used to know
I see a string of girls who have put me on the floor
The game is nearly over and the hounds are at the door
She walks through the corn leadin down to the river
Her hair shone like gold in the hot morning sun
She took all the love that this poor boy could give her
And left me to die like a fox on the run
Like a fox, Like a fox, Like a fox on the run

On a warm summer night
And Cathy was cleaning the spoons
The radio played the hit parade
  And I hummed along with the tune
She asked me to change the station
Said the song just drove her insane
But it weren't just the music playing
It was me she was trying to blame
And the sky is black and still now
On the hill where the angels sing
Ain't it funny how an old broken bottle
Looks just like a diamond ring
But it's far, far from me
Well, I leaned on my left leg
In the parking lot dirt
And Cathy was closing the lights
A june bug flew from the warmth he once knew
And I wished for once I weren't right
Why we used to laugh together
And we'd dance to any old song
Well, ya know she still laughs with me
But she waits just a second too long
And the sky is black and still now
On the hill where the angels sing
Ain't it funny how an old broken bottle
Looks just like a diamond ring
But it's far, far from me
Well, I started the engine
And I gave it some gas
And Cathy was closing her purse
Well, we hadn't gone far in my beat up old car
And I was prepared for the worst
Will you still see me tomorrow?
No, I got too much to do
Well, a question ain't really a question
If you know the answer too
And the sky is black and still now
On the hill where the angels sing
Ain't it funny how an old broken bottle
Looks just like a diamond ring
But it's far, far from me

Makin’ waves and tides and ripples and rings
There’s a leaf in the wind

Pretty soon he'll be gone
and he's got one good song to sing

It's in your heart not your head
and you got to sing and sing and sing
There’s a window in the wall
looking out on it all
leavin’ fears and tears and troubles alone
There’s a fire in the stove
keepin’ out the cold
warmin’ wine and winters and babies and homes
Seems like everyone is out, looking for the sun
singin’ rain and pain on he who hesitates

Got laid off down at the factory 
And their timing's not the greatest in the world
Heaven knows I been working hard
Wanted Christmas to be right for daddy's girl
I don't mean to hate December
It's meant to be the happy time of year
And my little girl don't understand
Why daddy can't afford no Christmas here     
If we make it through December 
Everything's gonna be alright I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow     
If we make it through December
Got plans to be a warmer town come summertime
Maybe even California
If we make it through December we'll be fine

15,The Passenger,Chris LeDoux,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/chris-ledoux/the-passenger-chords-886763,"It was dark and I was drivin' down a loney Texas road
The night was hot and sleep pulled at my eyes
I was thinkin' bout the wild times and the women that I'd had
The deceitful things I'd done and those lies
Standin' in the shadows by the side of the road
Was a figure of a withered old man
He wore a black bandanna a rolled brim Stetson hat 
With a two inch scarlet hat band
He held his wrinkled hand up as a sign to shut her down
So I pulled over and stopped by his side
He opened up the door slid in and sat down
He said my ain't it hot tonight
I studied this old man and it seemed mighty strange
For him to be out here all alone
Then he started talkin' and he told me many things
Of times like both of us had known
He told me of the wild life and the women that he'd had
How none of them had ever meant a thing
And he told me of a black night much the same as this
Of the strange and awesome things he'd seen
A man beside the road had raised his hand
and flagged him down so he stopped and let him in
That stranger told him stories like I am hearing now
Bout the wild times and all the sin
Then the car got cold and clammy and this old man looked at me
He said boy I've come here for you
Your days of wicked sinnin' have come to an end
and as mortal on this earth boy you are through
Then his eyes got red and fiery as he took his Stetson off
To reveal his evil horns shiny and black
My God the fear came o'er me and my senses were all lost
I fought with him until we finally crashed
Next day the car was found at the bottom of a draw
The young cowboy was found beside the wreck
His car had been consumed by fire 
but the cowboy had no marks
Except the smokin' pitch fork brand upon his neck

The guy who tended bar was watching ironsides on tv
Uninvited he sat down and opened up his mind

Ain't but three things in life that's worth a solitary dime

And friends are hard to find when they discover that you're down

Now it's old dogs and children  and watermelon wine
He said old dogs care about you even when you make mistakes
God bless little children while they're still too young to hate

How could she,  how could she
Just walk out and leave me
After all these nights in her arms look where I am

Ten more just in case that don't do the trick 
I'll be dead broke tomorrow morning with heartaches by the dozen
And a lady on my mind that's driving me crazy

41,Please Dont Bury Me (ver 2),John Prine,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-prine/please-dont-bury-me-chords-1138279,"Woke up this morning, put on my slippers
Walked in the kitchen and died
And oh what a feeling when my soul went through the ceiling
and on up in to heaven I did rise
When I got there they did say John it happened this-a-way
you slipped upon the floor and hit your head
And all the angels say just before you passed away
these were the very last words that you said 
Please don't bury me down in that cold cold ground
I'd rather have 'em cut me up and pass me all around
Throw my brains in a hurricane the blind can have my eyes
The deaf can take both of my ears if they don't mind the size
Give my stomach to Milwaukee if they run out of beer 
Put my socks in a cedar box just get 'em out'a here 
Venus de milo can have my arms Look out! I've got your nose
Sell my heart to the junk man and give my love to Rose
But, please don't bury me down in that cold cold ground
I'd rather have 'em cut me up and pass me all around
Throw my brains in a hurricane the blind can have my eyes
And the deaf can take both of my ears if they don't mind the size
Give my feet to the foot-loose careless fancy free
Give my knees to the needy don't 'cha pull that stuff on me
Hand me down my walkin' cane, it's a sin to tell a lie
Send my mouth way down south and kiss my ass goodbye
But, please don't bury me down in that cold cold ground
I'd rather have 'em cut me up and pass me all around
Throw my brains in a hurricane the blind can have my eyes
The deaf can take both of my ears if they don't mind the size

He believed in love and peace and never wore no shoes;
Long hair, beard and sandals and a funky bunch of friends,
Reckon they just nailed him up so he'd come down again.
Cause everybody's got to have somebody to look down on,
Those they can be better than at any time they please,
Some folks doin' something dirty decent folks can frown on,
If you can't find nobody else, then help yourself to me. 
Eggheads fussin,' rednecks cussin,' hippies for their hair,
Others laugh at straights, who laugh at freaks, who laugh at squares;
Some folks hate the whites, who hate the blacks, who hate the Klan,
Most of us hate anything that we don't understand.

The time for gifts and giving
As the year draws to its close

Christmastime when I was young
The magic   and the wonder
Colors dull and candles dim
And darkness standing under
  Oh little angel in shining light
You send my soul to dreaming
  You've given back my joy in life
And filled me with new meaning
Merry Christmas, little Zachary

They kept my daddy over in Macon jail

You won't hear them bloodhounds on your trail
Well I fell in with bad companions
Robbed a man, oh up in Tennessee
They caught me way up in Nashville
They locked me up and threw away the key
I washed my hands in muddy water
Washed my hands, but they didn't come clean
Tried to do what my daddy told me
But I must have washed my hands in a muddy stream
Well I asked the judge now when's my time up
He said son, oh you know we won't forget
If you try just to keep your hands clean
We might just make a good man of you yet
Oh I couldn't wait to get my time up
I broke out, broke out of Nashville jail
I just crossed the state-line of Georgia
Well I can hear those bloodhounds on my trail

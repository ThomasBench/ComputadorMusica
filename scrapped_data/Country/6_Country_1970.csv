Prettiest woman you ever laid eyes on.
But a man of low degree stood by her side.
Promised her he'd take her for his bride.
Delta Dawn what's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
Did I hear you say he was meetin' you here 
today..to take you to his mansion in the sky?
She's forty one and her daddy still calls her, baby.
All the folks around Brownsville say she's crazy.
Cause she walks downtown with a suitcase in her hand.
Lookin' for a mysterious dark-haired man.
Delta Dawn what's that flower you have on?
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?
Did I hear you say he was meetin' you here 
today..to take you to his mansion in the sky?
Delta Dawn what's that flower you have on?

But sometimes lord, she just ain't always around
And you know that's when I fall, I can't help myself at all
And I get whiskey bent and hell bound
Play me some songs about a ramblin' man, put a cold one in my hand
'cause you know I love to hear those guitar sounds
Don't you play 'I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry' cause I'll get all balled up inside
And I'll get whiskey bent and hell bound
Sure enough about closing time, (I'm) about stoned out of my mind
And I end up with some honky-tonk special I found
Just as sure as the morning sun come, thinking of my sweet girl at home
And I need to get whiskey bent and hell bound
Play me some songs about a ramblin' man, put old Jim Beam in my hand
'cause you know I still love to get drunk and hear country sounds
But don't you play 'Your Cheatin' Heart' cause that'll tear me all apart
I'll get whiskey bent and hell bound

At the end of day when work was over

And we'd count our many blessings one by one
I can see us sitting round the table 
When from the family Bible dad would read
And I can hear my mother softly singing 
Rock of ages rock of ages cleft for me
This old world of ours is full of trouble 
But this old world would also better be
If we'd find more Bibles on the tables 
And mothers singing rock of ages cleft for me

It was Richmond, Virginia. . . we were bummim’ around,
Suitcase to suitcase. . . we started in talkin‘,
Finding out about the things we've shared in the miles we've been
Well, he had a gray pillowcase full of books by Durrell,
And he had this old concertina, all beat up and she played like hell,
Until you got him started singing those Gospel songs,
Well, he drank all night for nothing, he told his stories till dawn.
And he said, ""Come on, get your bag, boy! Sun's up now and it's time to roll!
Yeah you know there ain't no better time than early in the mornin’
To be out walking down that road!
Just feeling another day beginnin’, whilst all the fools is rushin’ on by,
We'll be like some Mr. Independence: we're taking our own sweet time!""
We walked on out that highway under a clear blue sky,
I was listenin’ to the tales he told, drinking warm red wine.
'Bout a night he rolled seven; bout some girl he'd done wrong;
'Bout everything he could think of while we walked along.
Yeah, ol' Stoney had a magic; made him hard to forget.
Like the night we flew down the highway his old pickup, it nearly wrecked!
With a crazy woman driving, all drunked up and carrying on;
Till Stoney finally calmed her singing those Gospel songs.
Well, we split the road at Norwood, and he just shook my hand.
He said, ""I'll see you some place, friend,"" but you know he never has.
But we were that free then, just walking down the road,
Never really caring where that highway goes.
Yeah, Stoney was a liar and a bullshitter, ain't no doubt about it.
It was just the way he told things, that you never want to doubt him.
'Cause he kept you going when the road got rough,
And brought you through the lean times by making it up.
""Hey, did I ever tell you the time I married my cousin up in Las Vegas?""
Yeah, Stoney. Tell it again…

To the corner of the kitchen wall

Waiting for

You could die in the living room
Take the fan from the window
Prop the door back with a broom
The cuckoo clock has died of shock
And the windows feel no pain
The air's as still
As the throttle on a funeral train

On an August afternoon
I sipped bourbon and cried
With a friend by the light of the moon
So its hurry! hurry! Step right up
It's a matter of life or death
The sun is going down
And the moon is just holding its breath

  Far across the sea
Waiting for
That burns inside of me
And I feel a storm

Living on the hopeless hungry side of town
I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime

About the road to hapinnes, through love and charity
Why you would think he’s talking straight to you and me

In  our streak-of-lightning-cars and fancy clothes

Up front there ought to be a man in black

For the reckless ones whose bad trips left them cold
I wear the black in mourning for the lives that could have been
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men
And I wear it for the thousands who have died
Believing that the Lord was on their side

Pinballs and pool halls flashin their lights
Making change behind the counter in a penny arcade
Sat the fat girl daughter of Virginia and Ray
Lydia hid her thoughts like a cat
Behind her small eyes sunk deep in her fat
She read romance magazines up in her room
And it felt just like Sunday on a Saturday afternoon 
But dreaming just comes natural
Like the first breath of a baby
Like sunshine feeding daisies
Like the love hidden deep in your heart
Bunk beds,shaved heads ,Saturday night
A warehouse of strangers with sixty watt lights 
Staring through the ceiling just wanting to be
Lay one of too many younge PFC
There were spaces between Donald and whatever he said 
Strangers had forced him to live in his head
He envisioned the detail of a romantic scene
After midnight in the stillness of the barracks letrine
But dreaming just comes natural
Like the first breath from a baby
Like sunshine feeding daisies 
Like the love hidden deep in your heart
Hot love,cold love ,no love at all
A portrait of guilt hung on the wall
Nothing is wrong,nothing is right
Donald and Lydia made love that night
They made love in the mountains,they made love in the streams
They made love in the valley ,they made love in their dreams
But when they were finished there was nothing to say
Cause mostly they made love ten miles away
But dreaming just comes natural
Like the first breath from a baby

And somehow  I'll be feeling  it will be
When it comes your time to travel  like wise don't feel lost
For I will be the first one that you'll see.

And come running through the shallow water reaching for your hand.

It's brought us trembling hands and failing eyes

Until you come then we'll see paradise.

41,No Charge,Tammy Wynette,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tammy-wynette/no-charge-chords-2883869,"- My little girl came up to me in the kitchen
This evenin' while I was fixin' supper.
And she handed me a piece of paper
She'd been writing on, and
After wiping my hands on my apron I read it.
And this is what it said:
- ""For mowing the yard, five dollars.
For making my own bed this week, one dollar.
Going to the store, fifty cents.
Playing with little sister
While you went to the store, twenty-five cents.
Taking out the trash, one dollar.
Getting a good report card, five dollars.
And for raking the yard, two dollars.
Total owed, fourteen dollars and seventy-five cents.""
(Bridge is used for Key change +1 fret)
- Well, I looked at her standing there expectantly
And a thousand mem'ries flashed through my mind
And so I picked up the pen and turning the paper over.
- This is what I wrote:
For the nine months I carried you
Growing inside me, no charge.
For the nights I sat up with you
Doctored you prayed for you, no charge.
For the toys, food and clothes
And for wiping you nose, there's no charge.
When you add it all up
The full cost of my love is no charge.
- Well, when she finished reading
She had great big old tears in her eyes
And she looked up at me and said:
""Mom, I sure do love you"".
Then she took the pen
And in great big letters she wrote:
""Paid in full"".
When you add it all up
The cost of real love is no charge.

All the things I've done and how it's been
And I can't help believing in my own mind
I know I'm gonna hate to see it end
I've seen a lot of sunshine, slept out in the rain
Spent a night or two all on my own
I've known my lady's pleasures, had myself some friends
And spent a time or two in my own home
And I have to say it now it's been a good life all in all
It's really fine to have a chance to hang around
And lie there by the fire and watch the evening tire
While all my friends and my old lady sit and pass the pipe around
And talk of poems and prayers and promises and things that we believe in
How sweet it is to love someone, how right it is to care
How long it's been since yesterday and what about tomorrow
And what about our dreams and all the memories we share
The days they pass so quickly now, nights are seldom long
And time around me whispers when it's cold
The changes somehow frighten me, still I have to smile
It turns me on to think of growing old
For though my life's been good to me there's still so much to do
So many things my mind has never known
I'd like to raise a family, I'd like to sail away
And dance across the mountains on the moon
And I have to say it now it's been a good life all in all
It's really fine to have a chance to hang around
And lie there by the fire and watch the evening tire
While all my friends and my old lady sit and pass the pipe around
And talk of poems and prayers and promises and things that we believe in
How sweet it is to love someone, how right it is to care
How long it's been since yesterday and what about tomorrow
And what about our dreams and all the memories we share

46,Rocky Mountain High (ver 2),John Denver,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-denver/rocky-mountain-high-chords-1087677,"He was born in the summer of his 27th year,
Comin' home to a place he'd never been before.
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again,
You might say he found a key for every door.
When he first came to the mountain his life was far away,
On the road and hangin' by a song,
But the string's already broken and he doesn't really care,
It keeps changin' fast and it don't last for long.
But the Colorado Rocky Mountain high, I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky.
The shadow from the starlight is softer than a lullaby.
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado.
He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below,
He saw everything as far as you can see.
And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun,
And he lost a friend, but kept his memory.
Now he walks in quiet solitude the forests and the streams,
Seeking grace in every step he takes.
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake.
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high, I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky.
You can talk to God and listen to the casual reply.
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado.
Now his life is full of wonder, but his heart still know some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend.
Why they try to tear the mountain down to bring in a couple more,
More people, more scars upon the land.
And the Colorado Rocky Mountain high, I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky.
I know he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an eagle fly.
Rocky Mountain high, it's a Colorado Rocky Mountain high,
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky, friends around the
campfire and everybody's high,
Rocky Mountain high, Colorado, Rocky Mountain high, Colorado.

Looking for something that I’d like to do with my life

To be more than enough to just be here today

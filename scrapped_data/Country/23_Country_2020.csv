0,My Worst,Will Hoge,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/will-hoge/my-worst-chords-3228908," I've held on to foolish things
 I wandered around from dream to dream
 Never knowing just what it  means
 Holding  on to to these foolish things
 It's easier to say than it is to do
 And I know what you say is true
 I'm breaking us and blaming you
 It's easier to say than it is to do
  Let it go, let it go
 Or you'll never really know
 Why is it so easy going straight to where it hurts?
 When it comes to you,
Why do I always seem to do my worst
 And I'm here wrestling with a ghost
 That hurts the one that I love the most
 Another ""I'm sorry"" doesn't even come close
 I'm here wrestling with the ghost
Let it go, let it go
 Or you'll never really know
 Why is it so easy going straight to where it hurts?
 When it comes to you,
Why do I always seem to do my worst
     My worst
     Hey
(Let it go, let it go - ooh ooh ooh)

1,Maybe This Is Ok,Will Hoge,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/will-hoge/maybe-this-is-ok-chords-3228932,"Temperamental blue skies and faded love
Choking back the white lies and talking tough
Some boys should never cry, I hear that silly echo in my head
But something's in my eyes
Streaming from the last things that you said
  But then I stop and turn around
'Cause I feel sa-afe
And it seems a little stra-ange
It's a funny thing to say
But maybe this is O-K
  Transcendental new smiles and wasted youth
Another night of hard miles to call a truce
Good things never last, the sad songs keep on ringing in my ears
Fighting off the past, learning good things don't just disappear
  The mystery has come unwound
  I slowly lay this armor down
'Cause I feel sa-afe
And it seems a little stra-ange
It's a funny thing to say
But maybe this is O-K
Oooh, I feel sa-afe
And it seems a little stra-ange

Listen to the wind and pray the day goes by
Without a heat wave from the desert, a tornado from the north
A dust storm that only ever blows back and forth
They say you got to be a farming man or a roughneck on the rig
They say either way it’s your own grave to dig
I have found a way to live without paying such a price
I have made a home in this country paradise
Gonna do a little caprockin'
A little slow talkin'
Walk of fame walkin’ with the one I love
Gonna do a little county fairin'
Be a cattle baron
And I see them stars burnin' up above
Gonna do a little... caprockin'
I got 40 pristine acres, my own slice of life
An angel from Plainview that's bound to be my wife
Front row seat to sunset, a truck that just won't quit
A cask in the back that's about to be moonlit
Gonna do a little caprockin'
A little slow talkin'
Walk of fame walkin’ with the one I love
Gonna do a little county fairin'
Be a cattle baron
And I see them stars burnin' up above
Gonna do a little... caprockin'
Sister had her fill and took her family east of Dallas
Bought a home in a city that looks like a crystal palace
She swears I’d love the neighborhood, I should consider moving there
Hate to break it to you sis, but I ain't going anywhere
Gonna do a little caprockin'
A little slow talkin'

Pull the laces through the leather
And try to hold it all together
And maybe you can find a blind man

You know the Mona Lisa
Was just another rich man's daughter
 That ended up with nothin' but a broken-down smile
Don't listen to the voices
'Cause you know just what the choice is
It's time to wave goodbye to all the pretty horses
 The willows all are weeping
And the time is slowly seeping
Through the cracks in all the doors that you left open on the way
The goodbyes he never gave you
And now there's nothin' left to save you

I find another yesterday

It's gonna make you build a fortress
Where you never had a wall
It's gonna make you question God
And wonder if he even cares

And when you're broken past the point
Of what a broken heart can take
The cracks'll heal but you'll always feel the break

It still feels like a new scar
One that you dont talk about
At twenty-five, you'll find the strength to say it
And even though you can't change it
There's peace in saying it out loud
You'll feel angry, you'll feel sad once you see it's not your fault
And that canyon in your chest is that little girl you lost

The Father, Son, the Holy Ghost
Take whatever fate provides
Time is never on our side

Sometimes an instant never dies

Getting older, then hesitating
Hear good things come to those that wait

Hit the ground running like a wind and I was gone
I was faster than a rabbit and I left the deer behind
And the mountains couldn't hold me so I headed down the line
Got to California and joined up with Uncle Sam
Said ""I've come to halt the Nazis I'm a mighty mighty man""
They couldn't hold me down
So they taught me how to fly
Then they shipped me 'cross the ocean
Now I'm the fastest man alive
My name's Charles Elwood Yeager, everybody called me Chuck
I'm a bone stick and rudder mother brother sure enough
I was all that they could handle
till they shot me down in France
Then I swam across the Channel just to get another chance
When the war was over, pinned a medal on my chest
Then sent me to an airfield in the desert way out west
Said ""Someone got an airplane everybody's scared to fly""
Said ""Bubba let me at her I'm the fastest man alive.”
Well she looked like she was flying
'Fore she ever left the ground
So we strapped to her to a bomber and we took a spin around
Said ""Boys all call her Glennis. She’s the one I love the best.”
What you say we put her aerodynamics to a test?""
We were high above the desert when we let the sucker drop
When we lit that Roman candle boy you should've heard her pop
It shook the mighty mountains when we crossed that sonic line
Seven hundred miles an hour I'm the fastest man alive

I'm a mover, I'm a shaker. Ask your mother if I ain’t

Now I’ve made mistakes, I’m living proof of that
All the wasted days, can’t never get them back
Check my bags, board again
It’s a lonely flight from where I’ve been
Can’t turn money back to time
Take it from me, darling of mine
I’ve been doubting it these days
River it runs only one way
When it’s gone, it’s gone to stay
Baby when I’m gone, you’re learning how to live
Remember not to take so much
so you have something left to give
Just think of me and the love that I leave behind
Let it grow around you like a tie that binds
Got disconnected on the phone
I face the crowd but I sleep alone
Can’t turn money back to time
Take it from me, darling of mine
I’ve been doubting it these days
River, it runs only one way
When it’s gone
It’s gone to stay

Can't get through, it’s not like before
You were the footsteps and I was the floor
Silence grew like a cold, cold war
What happened to our love?
What is this life, and what does it mean?
Time, it runs out and rips at the seams
Like oil in water, hellfire and rain
We fight, we make up, just to make love again
You were the lightning and I was the thunder
Came on like a tidal wave and pulled me under
That kind of chemistry can make anyone wonder
What happened to our love?
You were the flower and I was the rain
You were the needle and I was the vein
You were the blood and I was the stain
When the push came to shove
If anyone here knew me the best
You put me to bed when I needed rest
Came in from the East, burned out in the West
Like a fire from above
Born in the pain, die in the mud
We wander this Earth as we circle the sun
In time and through space till we're dust in the wind
But I love you so much
that I’d find you again, find you again

It ain't that hard to tell
We ate in silence for a little while
Before she shrugged and with a little smile, she told me
Meeting you's been great and such, but you
Can't fake the natural touch
It's one of love's most important rules
Sometimes you gotta be the bug, it's true
And sometimes you're the windshield too, that's when
You gotta hold the line
I'd been seeing someone about a month or so
When she asked me, ""Where you wanna go?"" I told her,
""There's a little chicken spot I know""
We had a pleasant time
She kissed me on the mouth and squeezed my hand, asked me
""When you wanna go out again?"", told her
""Meeting you's been great and such, but you
Can't fake the natural touch""
'Cause ain't loving just another show?
You post a pic so everybody knows
Gotta leave 'em laughing when you go, but
Don't give away too much, oh no
Can't fake the natural touch
You can't fake the natural touch
There's plenty fishes swimming in the sludge, but you
Can't fake the natural touch
You can't fake the natural touch
You can't fake the natural touch
There's plenty fishes swimming in the sludge, but you
Can't fake the natural touch

To myself, I may be untrue

We grew up with the TV on
We learned how from Hollywood
We learned how from Hollywood
Riding with my headphones on
In the back of my mama's car
Winding down that dirty road
Town was close but it felt far
Town was close but it felt far
Drive in movies, Coca-Cola
Sweet 16, that kiss of death
Don't you cry when you should laugh, babe
I smell liquor on your breath
I smell liquor on your breath
If it don't break you
It might just make you rich
You might not get there
And on the way it's a bitch
Gettin by, gettin high
Feeling like a low life bum
Racked up debt, couldn't pay my rent
Pissin' off till kingdom come
Pissin' off till kingdom come
Mother Mary, geez Louise
I was having a ball until I threw it too far
Playin' dives, tryin' to stay alive
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

It might just make you rich
You might not get there
And on the way it's a bitch
But then I won the lottery
I struck gold and they picked me
Winner winner, chicken dinner
Hello mama look at me
Hello mama look at me
Now everything's turned inside out
They wanna put me on a big TV
Everybody wants to know
How I feel and what I think

Someone to make me change

That reaches the edges and pulls you back
Just wish I'd have known right from the start

Or what she does to me when she stares across
This midnight, string lights, bourbon toast

From the roads that you walk and the scars that you earn
I built a few walls, I prayed that they'd fall
And the one thing I've seen after seeing it all

Baby, things went bad and things went worse
I guess you know the end
The only thing I know for sure is I ain't going back again
They took me down to cellblock B after stripping off my clothes
Put me in a monkey suit and threw me in the throes
Like a rat in a maze, a cow in the herd
or a sparrow with a broken wing
Now I know the reason why the caged bird has to sing
Cause I'm just a weekender in the Davidson County Jail
And my old man, he ain't got the cash to even go my bail
Should have listened to my mama and quit my life of sin
Before I went backsliding again
This bed is hard and the room is cold
and my cellmate's got a cough
She takes her meds and sleeps all day
got six more weeks till she's off
She said she beat her boyfriend up
while high on crack cocaine
And now she sits and watches her young life go down the drain
Cause she's just a weekender in the Davidson County Jail
Her old man ain't got the cash to even go her bail
She should have listened to her mama and quit her life of sin
Before she went backsliding again
Walk into some other room, they tried to make me eat
Red-eyed gravy, cardboard bread and something that looked like meat
One tough girl from cellblock C
picked a fight with the man at the desk
Mighty soon was sent back to her room and I bet you know the rest

But, baby, one day, hey, you're gonna celebrate (Gonna celebrate)
Your independence day

Put her in a big house
Dress her up put a million bucks in her bank account
But she's still gonna be
Down to earth
No you can't take the small town country girl out of her
She's hillbilly banjo hip hop rap
Oak on the fire, ribs on the rack
Smoke 'em if ya got 'em, drink 'em till the yeti runs dry
Cut off shorts and a camo cap
Yeehaw holler from the deck out back
Enough to make the neighbors run and hide
She can't keep her backwoods in check
Hashtag redneck
He's got a 99 jersey
And a whitetail rack
Hanging on the wall by his coveralls
In his fishing shack
He's got a pimped out tractor
Pontoon in a slip
And a Talladega Nascar race on his bucket list
He's hillbilly banjo hip hop rap
Oak on the fire, ribs on the rack
Smoke 'em if ya got em, drink 'em till the yeti runs dry
Boots and shorts and a camo cap
Yeehaw holler from the deck out back
Enough to make the neighbors run and hide
She can't keep her backwoods in check
Hashtag redneck
Well they're hillbilly banjo hip hop rap
Oak on the fire, ribs on the rack
Smoke 'em if ya got em, drink 'em till the yeti runs dry
Boots and shorts and a camo cap
Yeehaw holler from the deck out back
Enough to make the neighbors run and hide
If you can't keep her backwoods in check, well
If you can't keep her backwoods in check
You're a hashtag redneck

48,How You Get Hurt,Courtney Marie Andrews,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/courtney-marie-andrews/how-you-get-hurt-chords-3255815,"Are you thinking what I’m thinking?
Do you wish that I would stay?
If I missed you, I wouldn’t tell you
Best not to give ourselves away
That’s how you get hurt
You let your guard down
You make a move,
then it doesn’t work out
That’s how you get hurt
Do you remember that night in Nashville?
Took you dancing with my friends
Laura taught you how to two-step,
then you took me for a spin
That’s how you get hurt
You let your guard down
You take a chance,
then it doesn’t work out
That’s how you get hurt
That's how you get hurt
Thought of calling, thought of a letter
Thought of you almost every day
But maybe this distance is for the better,
until we both learn how to stay
I don’t wanna get hurt
Let my guard down
Fall in love,
if it doesn’t work out
That’s how you get hurt
That's how you get hurt

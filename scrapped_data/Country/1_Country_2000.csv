0,Hurt,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/hurt-chords-89849,"   I hurt myself today   to see if I still feel
I focus on the pain   the only thing that's real
The needle tears a hole   the old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away   but I remember everything
What have I become?     My sweetest friend
Everyone I know  goes away in the end
And you could have it all   My empire of dirt
I will let you down    I will make you hurt
   I wear this crown of thorns   upon my liar's chair
Full of broken thoughts   I cannot repair
Beneath the stains of time   the feelings disappear
You are someone else   I am still right here
What have I become?     My sweetest friend
Everyone I know  goes away in the end
And you could have it all   My empire of dirt
I will let you down   I will make you hurt
If I could start again  a million miles away
I would keep myself  I would find a way

I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don't go, and I said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me I was
Begging you please don't go, and I said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say yes
Romeo, save me, they try to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real,
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say yes, oh
I got tired of waiting,   wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said
Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
Marry me, Juliet you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say yes
Uh oh, uh oh

slashed a hole in all 4 tires

Where the peaches grow

Not where you live or the car you drive or the price tag on your clothes

Rock me mama anyway you feel
Hey, mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
Hey, mama rock me
Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly
Had a nice long toke
But he's a headed west from the Cumberland Gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I gotta get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby callin' my name
And I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh
At least I will die free
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama anyway you feel
Hey, mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
Hey, mama rock me

There's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend; sometimes you stand; sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar, come ride with me to the distant shore
  We won't hesitate to break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today
Life is a highway, I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way, I wanna drive it all night long
Through all these cities, and all these towns
It's in my blood and in it's all around
I love you now, like I loved you then;
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's Lights
Knock me down and back up again
  There's no load I can't hold, a road so rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Just tell 'em we're survivors
Life is a highway, I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way, I wanna drive it all night long
Life is a highway, I wanna ride it all night long
If you're going my way, I wanna drive it all night long
   There was a distance between you and I (between you and I)
   A misunderstanding once, but now we look it in the eye
There ain't no load that I can't hold, a road so rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Tell 'em we're survivors

A pair of jeans that fit just right and the radio up
Well I was raised up beneath the shade of a georgia pine and that's home 
Sweet tea, pecan pie and home made wine where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground
And a little bit of chicken fried, cold beer on a friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right and the radio up
I like to seen the sun rise, see the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child, and know a mother's love
Well its funny how it`s the little things in life that mean the most 
Not where you live or what you drive or the price tag on your clothes 
There`s no dollar sign on a piece of mind this I`ve come to know 
So if you agree have a drink with me, raise you glasses for a toast
To a little bit of chicken fried , cold beer on a friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right and the radio up
I like to seen the sun rise, see the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child, and know a mother's love
I thank god for my life 
And for the stars and stripes 
May freedom forever fly, let it ring. 
Salute the ones who died 
The ones that give their lives so we don`t have to sacrifice 
All the things we love 
Like our chicken fried, cold beer on a friday night
A pair of jeans that fit just right and the radio up
I like to seen the sun rise, see the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child, and know a mother's love
Getcha a little chicken fried, cold beer on a friday night

Alley-ways and pay phone calls,
I've been everywhere with you.
We laugh until we think we’ll die,
Barefoot on a summer night
Nothin’ new is sweeter than with you
And in the streets you run afree,
Like it's only you and me,
Geeze, you're something to see.

It's all black and white and it ain't real clear
Is that you there? He said yeah, I was 11.
Times were tough back in '35
That's me and Uncle Joe just tryin' to survive
A cotton farm
And a great depression
If it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color
Awe and this one here's taken overseas
In the middle of Hell in 1943
In the winter time, you can almost see my breath
That was my tail gunner: Ole Johnny McGee
He was a High School teacher from New Orleans
And he had my back, right through the day we left
If it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other
You should've seen it in color
A picture's worth a thousand words
But you can't see what those shades of gray keep covered.
You should've seen it in color.
This one is my favorite one. 
This is me and grandma in the summer sun 
All dressed up the day we said our vows. 
You can't tell it here but it was hot that June 
That rose was red and her eyes were blue 
And just look at that smile I was so proud. 
      That's the story of my life 
      Right there in black and white
If it looks like we were scared to death
Like a couple of kids just tryin' to save each other

A picture's worth a thousand words
You should've seen it in color.

She broke his heart he spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
Until the night
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said I'll love her till I die
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby
la la la la la la la lalalalala
la la la la la la la lalalalala
The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away a little at a time

Until the night
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees

clinging to his picture for dear life

May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty-handed

Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance

Living might mean taking chances, but they're worth taking
Loving might be a mistake, but it's worth making

Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance

I cut my long baby hair
Stole me a dog-eared map

Flightless bird, jealous, weeping

Now I’m a fat house cat
Nursing my sore blunt tongue
Watching the warm poison rats
Curl through the wide fence cracks
Pissing on magazine

Thrown in the cold and clean
Blood of Christ mountain stream

And he decides, who to free, and who to blame
Everybody, won't be treated, all the same
There'll be a golden ladder, reaching down.
When the man comes around.
The hairs, on your arm, will stand up
At the terror, in each sip, and each sup
Will you partake of that last offered cup?
Or disappear, into the potter's ground?
When the man comes around.
Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers
One hundred million angels singin'
Multitudes are marchin' to a big kettledrum
Voices callin', voices cryin'
Some are born and some are dyin'
It's Alpha and Omega Kingdom come
And the whirlwind  is in the thorn trees
And the virgins are all trimming their wicks
The whirlwind in the thorn trees
It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks
Till Armageddon no shalom, no shalom
Then the father hen will call his chicken's home
The wise man will bow down before the throne
And at his feet they will cast the golden crowns…

Whoever is unjust let him be unjust still
Whoever is righteous let him be righteous still
Whoever is filthy let him be filthy still
Listen to the words long written down

Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers

Multitudes are marchin' to a big kettledrum
Voices callin', voices cryin'
Some are born and some are dyin'
It's Alpha and Omega Kingdom come
And the whirlwind  is in the thorn trees
And the virgins are all trimming their wicks

   It's hard to deal with the pain of losin you everywhere I go,
But I'm doin' it,
   It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone,
Still harder,
Gettin up, gettin dressed, livin with this regret,
But I know if I could do it over,     I would trade, give away
All the words that I saved in my heart that I left unspoken
   What hurts the most,      is being so close,
 And having so much to say,   and watching you walk away,
   And never knowin',        what could've been,
 And not seein that lovin you, is what I was tryin to do
                Hey
   What hurts the most,      was being so close,
 And having so much to say,(to say)  and watching you walk away,
   And never knowin',        what could've been,
 And not seein that lovin you, is what I was tryin to do,
And not seein that lovin you, That's what I was tryin to do.

Time stood still,   and love was all we knew,
You were the first, so was I,
We made love and then you cried,
Remember when
Remember when,   We vowed the vows and walk the walk,
Gave our hearts,    made the start and it was hard,
We lived and learned, life threw curves,
There was joy and there was hurt,
Remember when
Remember when,   old ones die and new were born,
Life was changed,   disassembled, rearranged,
We came together, fell apart,
We broke each others hearts,
Remember when
Remember when,    the sound of little feet,
Was the music,    we danced to week to week,
Brought back the love, we found trust,
Vowed we'd never give it up,
Remember when
Remember when,    thirty seemed so old,
Now looking back,    it's just a steppin stone,
To where we are, where we've been,
Said we'd do it all again,
Remember when
Remember when,    we said when we'd turn grey,
When the children,    grow up and move away,
We won't be sad, we'll be glad,
For all the life we've had,
And we'll remember when,
Remember when,
Remember when

But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
Until the night... 
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
They found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said I'll love her til I die
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The angel's sang a whiskey lullaby
La la la la la la la,  La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la,  La la la la la la la

For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath

Bought a borrowed suit and learned to dance

Her looming shadow grows
Hidden in the branches
of the poison creosote
She twines her spines up slowly
Towards the boiling sun
And when I touched her skin
My fingers ran with blood
In the hushing dusk
Under a swollen silver moon
I came walking with the wind
To watch the cactus bloom
A strange hunger haunted me,
The looming shadows danced
I fell down to the thorny brush
And felt a trembling hand
When the last light warms the rocks
And the rattlesnakes unfold
Mountain cats will come
to drag away your bones
And rise with me forever
Across the silent sand
And the stars will be your eyes
And the winds will be my hands

48,Gods Gonna Cut You Down (ver 2),Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/gods-gonna-cut-you-down-chords-480325,"You can run on for a long time,
Run on for a long time,
Run on for a long time,
Sooner, or later, God'll cut you down.
Sooner, or later, God'll cut you down.
Go and tell that long tongue liar,
Go and tell that midnight rider,
Tell the rambiler, the gambler, the back biter,
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down.
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down.
Well my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news.
My heads been wet with the midnight dew.
I've been down on bended knee,
talkin to the man from Galiee.
He spoke to me in a voice so sweet,
I thought I heard the shuffle of angels feet.
He called my name and my heart stood still,
Go and tell that long tongue liar,
Go and tell that midnight rider,
Tell the rambiler, the gambler, the back biter,
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down.
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down.
You can run on for a long time,
Run on for a long time,
Run on for a long time,
Sooner, or later, God'll cut you down.
Sooner, or later, God'll cut you down.
You may throw your rock, hide your hand,
Workin in the dark against your fellow man.
But as sure as God made black and white,
What's done in the dark, will be brought to the light.
You can run on for a long time,
Run on for a long time,
Run on for a long time,
Sooner, or later, God'll cut you down.
Sooner, or later, God'll cut you down.
Go and tell that long tongue liar,
Go and tell that midnight rider,
Tell the rambiler, the gambler, the back biter,
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down.
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down.
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down.

49,Its Five Oclock Somewhere (ver 2),Alan Jackson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/alan-jackson/its-five-oclock-somewhere-chords-820234,"The sun is hot and that old clock is movin' slow and so am I
Workday passes like molasses in wintertime but it's July
I'm getting paid by the hour and older by the minute
My boss just pushed me over the limit
I'd like to call him something
I think I'll just call it a day
Pour me something tall and strong
Make it a hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past 12 but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere
Well this lunch break is gonna take all afternoon and half the night
Tomorrow mornin' I know there'll be hell to pay but baby that's alright
Ain't had a day off now in over a year
My Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here
If the phone's for me you can tell 'em I've just sailed away
And pour me something tall and strong
Make it a hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past 12 but I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere
I could pay off my tab
pour myself in a cab
and be back to work before 2
At a moment like this
I can't help but wonder
   What would Jimmy Buffett do?
I'd say pour me something tall and strong
Make it a hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past 12 but I don't care
Pour me something tall and strong
Make it a hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past 12 but I don't care, I don't care
It's five o'clock somewhere

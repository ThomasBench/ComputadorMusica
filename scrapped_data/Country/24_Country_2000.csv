Make it stop on a dime
Make 'em wonder which way to go
 Make a man change his mind
She's a lawyer's queen, a trucker's dream
With a baseball hat fit for a queen
A genuine, a different kind of fine
Cadillacs and caviar
Well, that ain't how she rolls
 Implants and tummy tucks
She sure don't need those
She's a cool drink of water when the summer's mean
Poured into those Levis jeans
She's country as the day is long
She make a train take a dirt road
Make it stop on a dime
Make 'em wonder which way to go
Make a man change his mind
She's a lawyer's queen, a trucker's dream
With a baseball hat fit for a queen
A genuine, a different kind of fine
Tan and lean like a long-neck bottle
In the passenger seat got her hand on the throttle
She'll get you there right on time
Lord, take you down to Tijuana, make you wanna slap your momma
Gotcha all tore up and made you spill your dip cup
Bona fide, a different kind of fine
She make a train take a dirt road
Make it stop on a dime
Make 'em wonder which way to go
Make a man change his mind

Grease stains, bleach spots and a hole in the knee
You say the man inside those Levi's don't take orders
And she'll just have to realize you'll do as you damn well please

I'm so impressed, yeah whoopty-doo
You need to know that ain't how it works
It's not who wears the pants, it's who wears the skirt
At the top drawer of her dresser there's some panties
Go try on that purple pair with the lacy frill
With your big old thighs I bet you can't get in 'em
And with that attitude of yours, hell I bet you never will
You wear the pants, buddy good for you

A little thing like her can barely lift the bar
But just wait until that woman has a headache
And she sits there with her legs crossed, we'll see how strong you are

Cracked a rib when you hit the wall

Pull you down faster than a sunset

You take back what's been taken 
Get on your knees and dig down deep

Bring you back to being born again

And you think that there's no way out

You couldnâ€™t feel the light

Now here we are gathered in our little home town
This canâ€™t be the way you meant to draw a crowd
Oh , thatâ€™s what I keep asking
Was there anything I could have said or done
Oh I had no clue you were masking a troubled soul
God only knows what went wrong
and  youâ€™d leave the stage in the middle of a song
Now in my mind Iâ€™ll keep you frozen as a 17 year old
Rounding third to score the winning run
You always played with passion no matter what the game
When you took the stage you shined just like the sun
Oh , thatâ€™s what I keep asking
Was there anything I could have said or done
Oh I had no clue you were masking a troubled soul
God only knows what went wrong
and  youâ€™d leave the stage in the middle of a song

Now the oak trees a swaying in the early autumn breeze
The golden sun is shining on my face
Tangled thoughts I hear the mocking bird sing
This old world really ainâ€™t that bad a place
Oh  thereâ€™s no comprehending
And who am I to try judge or explain
Oh but I do have one burning question
Who told you life wasnâ€™t worth the fight
They were wrong
They lied
Now youâ€™re gone and we cry
Cause itâ€™s just not like you to walk away in the middle of a song
Your beautiful song
Your absolutely         beautiful  song

built out of love and made for water
ran her for years til the transom got rotten
a piece of my childhood will never be forgotten
It was just an old plywood boot,
a 75 johnson with an electric choke
a young boy two hands on the wheel
I cant replace the way it made me feel

You can't change things, we're all stuck in our ways
It's like trying to clean the ocean
What do you think you can drain it?
Well it was poison and dry long before you came
But you can wake up younger under the knife
And you can wake up sounder if you get analyzed
And I better wake up
There but for the grace of God, go I
It's hard to believe your prophets
When they're asking you to change things
But with their suspect lives we look the other way
Are you really that pure, Sir?
Thought I saw you in Vegas
It was not pretty, but she was (not your wife)
But she will wake up wealthy
And you will wake up 45
And she will wake up with babies
There but for the grace of God, go I

What am I fighting for?
The cops are at my front door
I can't escape that way, the windows are in flames
And what's that on your ankle?
You say they're not coming for you
But house arrest is really just the same (just the same)
Like when you wake up behind the bar
Trying to remember where you are
Having crushed all the pretty things
There but for the grace of God, go I
But I still believe
And I will rise up with fists
And I will take what's mine mine mine

To fall out of love and run screaming from our home 
Because we live in a house of mirrors
We see our fears and everything
Our songs, faces, and second hand clothes
But more and more we're suffering
Not nobody, not a thousand beers
Will keep us from feeling so all alone 
But you are what you love
And not what loves you back
That's why I'm here on your doorstep
Pleading for you to take me back 
The phone is a fine invention
It allows me to talk endlessly to you
About nothing disguising my intentions
Which I'm afraid, my friend, are wildly untrue 
It's a sleight of hand, a white soul band
The heart attacks I'm convinced I have
Every morning upon waking
To you I'm a symbol or a monument
Your rite of passage to fufillment
But I'm not yours for the taking 
But you are what you love
And not what loves you back
So i guess that's why you keep calling me back
I'm fraudulent, a thief at best
A coward who paints a bullshit canvas
Things that will never happen to me
But at arms length, it's Tim who said
I'm good at it, I've mastered it
Avoiding, avoiding everything 
But you are what you love tim
And not what loves you back
And I'm in love with illusions

I'll miss your skin, as golden as your wheatfield hair
And where you go I hope you find out there

And lets you know that God's alive
A better rain

And be all right again
In a better rain
Someday is gonna find you in a sweeter place
Long after time has erased
All the words like razor blades
You'll remember you and me before the flood
Once upon a time in love, a beautiful us
I can see you on some stretch of sand
Spinin' round in circles barefoot dancin' in

Break your heart, roll out of town
Cause gypsys never get tied down
Sometimes I wish I lived on a mountain
Drank from a stream instead of a fountain
I'd stay there, top of the world
But I was born a red dirt girl.
Unbrideled, or tethered and tied
The safety of the fence or the danger of the ride
I'll always be, unsatisified
Sometimes I wish I lived by a pier
in a lighthouse with a chandelier
I'd watch everybody's ships come in
And then I'd sail away with them.
Unanchored, in the storm or
Safely, on the shore
If this is all I need, why do I want more?
Sometimes I wish I lived in an airstream
Homemade curtains lived just like a gypsy.

There's a story that my daddy tells religiously,
Like clockwork everytime he see's an opening,
Bout the way things use to be
 I just roll my eyes and make a B-line for the door,
I'd always end up stary eyes and cross legged on the floor,
man the things I heard,
It was harder times and longer days,
Five miles to school uphill both ways,
We were cane swtiched raised and dirt floor poor,
Course that was back before the war,
Yea your uncle and I made quit a pair,
Flyin F-15's through hostile air,
 He went down but they missed me by a hair,
That's something to be proud of,
That's a life you can hang your hat on,
as your chins held high as the tears fall down,
gut sucked in, chest stuck out,
Like a small town flag a flyin,
Or a new born baby cryin,
In the arms of the woman that you love,
That's something to be proud of,
Son graduatin college, that was momma's dream,
And I was on my way to anywhere else when I turned Eighteen,
 and think you got everything,
I learned real quick those GTO's don't run off faith,
I ended up broke down in some town north of L.A.
for minimum wage,
I fell in love next thing I know,
Babies came and the car got sold,
Sure do miss that old Hot Rod,
But you sure save gas in them foriegn jobs,
Dad I wonder if I ever let you down,
If you're ashamed how I turned out,
Well he lowered his voice,    then he raised his brow,
That's something to be proud of,
That's a life you can hang your hat on,
No need to make a million just be thankful to be workin,
If you're doin what you're able,
Puttin food there on the table,
And providing for the family that you love,
That's something to be proud of,
And before you ever really do is the best you can,
  Well you did it man,
That's something to be proud of,
That's a life you can hang your hat on,
as your chins held high as the tears fall down,
gut sucked in, chest stuck out,
Like a small town flag a flyin,
Or a new born baby cryin,
In the arms of the woman that you love,

Where everything is black & white (da da da da...)

Watching the clouds roll by, bye bye

Through the trees as the wind blows
That's when I climb up here on this mountain
To look through God's window
Now I can't fly, but I got two feet
To get me high up here
Above the noise and city streets

Sitting on the roof of my car
Drinking cans of warm beer
Watching the sky get dark
Gail and I shot our empties
with an old rusted rifle
Her golden hair went flying
Like a wild brush fire
When the mountains turned red at dusk
Time passed in the burning desert
and the tumbleweeds they tumbled
We lay in a golden fire
As the screaming buzzards circled
Far down the darkened valley
The city lights still twinkled
But my eyes saw only Gail
And her hair of golden fire
When the mountains turned red at dusk
But the fire it burned right through her
Gail followed unseen voices
They led her to the city
Deep in the darkened valley
I drove circles through the alleys
Calling my burning lover
But Gail ran deeper into the gloom
Screaming at the streetlights
And I lost her there forever
Deep in the valley's darkness
My Gail with the golden hair
That burns bright as fire
When the mountains turned red at dusk

In the hearts of all people both near and far
Christmas everywhere
Feel the love of the season wherever you are
On the small country roads lined with green mistletoe
Big city streets where a thousand lights glow
Let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let every heart sing let every bell ring
The story of hope and joy and peace
And let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let anger and fear and hate disappear
Let there be love that lasts through the year
And let it be Christmas; Christmas everywhere
Let it be Christmas everywhere
With the gold and the silver, the green and the red
Christmas everywhere
On the smiles of all children asleep in their beds
In the eyes of young babies their first fallen snow
Elderly's memories that never grow old
Let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let every heart sing let every bell ring
The story of hope and joy and peace
And let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let anger and fear and hate disappear
Let there be love that lasts through the year
And let it be Christmas; Christmas everywhere
Let it be Christmas everywhere
In the songs that we sing and the gifts that we bring
Christmas everywhere
In what this day means and what we believe
From the sandy white beaches where blue water rolls
To snow covered mountains and valleys below
Let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let every heart sing let every bell ring
The story of hope and joy and peace
And let it be Christmas everywhere
Let heavenly music fill the air
Let anger and fear and hate disappear
Let there be love that lasts through the year
And let it be Christmas; Christmas everywhere

Our tug of war has only made me want you more
Steeped in hard luck and doomed to roam
My love is braver than you know
My forefathers, they worked this land
And I was schooled in the tyranny of nature's plans
Dressed in thunder a cloud came around
Oh, in the shape of a lion a hand came down
Now, damn this valley and damn this cold
Well, take so long to let me know
It's plant and reap and plow and sow
But tell me, will it grow?
   Dig my ditches in the golden sun
I'd be robbing these trains if I could catch me one
Now, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday's gone
Got me stone cold sober in a drought so long
Will it grow oh grow oh oh x2

I hung up the phone and it fell out of my hand,
But I knew I had to do it,
And he wouldn't understand,
So hard to see myself without him,
I felt a piece of my heart break,
But when you're standing at a crossroad,
There's a choice you gotta make.
I guess it's gonna have to hurt,
I guess I'm gonna have to cry,
And let go of some things I've loved,
To get to the other side,
I guess it's gonna break me down,
Like falling when you try to fly,
It's sad, but sometimes moving on with the rest of your life,
  I know there's a blue horizon,
Somewhere up ahead, just waiting for me,
Getting there means leaving things behind,
Sometimes life's so bitter sweet.
I guess it's gonna have to hurt,
I guess I'm gonna have to cry,
And let go of some things I've loved,
To get to the other side,
I guess it's gonna break me down,

It's sad, but sometimes moving on with the rest of your life,

  The wounds that you feel,
Somehow, right now.

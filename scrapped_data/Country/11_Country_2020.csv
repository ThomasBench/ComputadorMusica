Never knew it to go to my head like it did
When you were pullin' more than you usually do
How'd you know that I need an excuse
To say the words I never thought I'd use 'til I did?
Oh, what are the chances that your heart was thinkin'
What my heart was thinkin' when we got to drinkin'?
We caught lightin' in a bottle last night
You could feel the heat comin' off the vine
Fallin' for the first time, yeah, it just can't happen twice
We caught lightning in a bottle last night
I'd have to say the odds are in our favor
A little too early or a little bit later
And we mighta missed the moment
And the magic that came with it
I have a hard time believin' that it was so easy
But you made it easy
We caught lightin' in a bottle last night
You could feel the heat comin' off the vine
Fallin' for the first time, yeah, it just can't happen twice
We caught lightning in a bottle last night
Ooh, yoo hoo hoo hoo hoo yeah
Oh, what are the chances that your heart was thinkin'

Fallin' for the first time, yeah, it just can't happen twice

Go to the black tie inns
Street lights in the red dust (Red dust)
Take it out where it's just us

Don't need no neon nights
Gotta palm tree paradise

Back road, go and turn Twitty up
Pour a little whiskey in a Dixie cup

Ain't fishin' in the dark, but we gettin' Nitty Gritty
In the glow of the dashboard clock
No, girl we ain't gon' stop
 Gettin' down where the corn grows (Corn grows)

Summer heat's droppin', closin' up shoppin'
Lonely boardwalk empty rides, ghosts of lovers wave goodbye
The carnival's cryin', birds all flyin', south
I take a turn on your Mama's street wishin' I could catch a peek
Of you on that front step, like ""Boy are you here yet?""
But I know the truth in the lonesome sound of the choked leaves when they hit the ground
Summertime's dyin', birds all flyin', south
Well it might be over you might be gone
Might not miss me you might've moved on
But my love will still be hangin' around
When the birds fly south
I'm Passin' Burke's and that neon sign I laugh about the punch you threw that night
No you never did like her, but I never thought you'd fight her
And if I close my eyes I can feel your kiss taste the salt drippin' off your lips
But I'm brought back down to Earth by a breeze so cold it hurts
Well it might be over you might be gone
Might not miss me you might've moved on
But my love will still be hangin' around
When the birds fly south
When winter sets in
When springtime rolls back to summer again
Well it might be over you might be gone
Might not miss me you might've moved on

4,A Better South,American Aquarium,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/american-aquarium/a-better-south-chords-3175781,"I was born in the shade of a long leaf pine
The proud southern son of Caroline
Proud of who I am and where I'm from
But I ain't so proud of how far we've come
On the backs of the poor these towns were built
Where every ounce of pride comes with a pound of guilt
There's a shadow here, looms long and black
It's always one step forward and two steps back
The only dream that ain't worth having
Is the one you won't chase down
They say sing your songs, boy, and shut your mouth
But I believe in a better South
Yes I believe in a better South
Down here we're still fighting for all the wrong reasons
Old men still defend these monuments to treason
To the right side of history, we're always late
Still arguing the difference between heritage and hate
The only dream that ain't worth having
Is the one you won't chase down
They say sing your songs, boy, and shut your mouth
But I believe in a better South
Yes I believe in a better South
I'm sick and tired of listening to Daddy's generation
The byproduct of war and segregation
Still thinking they can tell us of what to do
Who can live where and who can love who
The only dream that ain't worth having
Is the one you won't chase down
They say sing your songs, boy, and shut your mouth
But I believe in a better South

And still make the 10 o'clock sermon
But the sky is blue and the breeze is cool
And they're bitin' good, not to mention
If I left right now might make it somehow
But I doubt I could pay attention
I'd rather be on the lake with my mind on God
In the middle of His creation
In an old john boat with my Zebco rod
For some private conversation
There might be a few people talkin' bad about me
When they see that I'm a-missin'
But I'd rather be on the lake with my mind on God
Than in church with my mind on fishin'

When he really gets to throwin' down
But I's rather do my talkin' with the man upstairs
When there's nobody else around
If I was there right now I'd be thinkin' about
Which lure I was gonna cast
And he don't need another fool sittin' in that pew
Dreamin' about a ten pound bass

I hope you find a guy that treats you right

  Remember looking up at them in the front row
Hands touched together, almost outta sight
It's been a long, hard week but now the slow release
Of a Sunday afternoon
  And we were only young but they were trying hard to reach us
  How was I to know that there was something so worth keeping?
  'Cause we were
Watching the world through an open window
Trees lined up like dominoes
This old car could find its own way home
It's the ordinary things that mean so much
That's where I learned it all, from them
To fight, to love, to laugh again
Man, I thought we were only wasting time
  Out on a Sunday drive
  The sun warms your soul just like an old friend
Singing songs along that ribbon of a road
And everyone you love is sitting there, so close
  You're never thinking that you'd ever get old
No, you'll never get old
Just watching the world through an open window
Trees lined up like dominoes
This old car could find its own way home

To fight, to love, to laugh again
Man, I thought we were only wasting time

""Son, don't drive too far""

  After a few miles I guess they recognized some places
And I listened as they reminisced
  About a world that they had always known
And how it's changing
Probably never gonna be the same again
  I caught 'em in the mirror, they were holding hands and smiling
  Looking younger than they'd been in years
Oh, through all the years
And they were
Watching the world through an open window
Trees lined up like dominoes
This old car could find its own way home
It's the ordinary things that mean so much
That's where I learned it all, from them
To fight, to love, to laugh again
Man, I thought we were only wasting time
   Out on a Sunday drive
    Out on a Sunday drive
    Out on a Sunday drive

My head was filled with questions
And my feet they long to roam
My arms reached out like branches
But my heart just couldn't stay
I left the moment that I could
a prisoner of the highway
I passed by farms and trailers
As I drove through little towns
I found trouble in the city
I never set my suitcase down
And in those empty alleys
Where retaining walls decay
I just kept on moving
as a prisoner of the highway
Ooh, and I don't know where I'm headed
Ooh, and I don't know where it ends
Well, the wind, it felt like freedom
As it whipped through my hair
I was everywhere and everyone
I was nobody and nowhere
Oh, the map was written on my hand
and in my DNA
I believe that I was meant to be
a prisoner of the highway
Had chains around my ankles
Handcuffs on my wrists
I was haunted by decisions
And simple things I missed
Dear God, why do I wander?
Was I born this way?
And I prayed he would release me
as a prisoner of the highway
Ooh, and I don't know where I'm headed
Ooh, and I don't know where it ends
I sacrificed my family
Sacrificed true love
I sacrificed my unborn child
to the heavens up above
Oh, there was not a limit
To those I would betray
I was deep down in it
as a prisoner of the highway
I just kept a-moving
as a prisoner of the highway

The 7-Up would balance out the beer
Mom would make us dinner, and we'd all try not to choke
Dad was working later every year
We count the trucks on Highway 1 on their way to Jacksonville
Wonderin’ where they headed on from there
My brothers and my sister all stood spiritually still
As if those roads became the answers to their prayers
   But I didn't want it any other way
This town was the one thing that felt right
   All these tourists could be kings during the day
  But not in St. Augustine at night
I was working at the bait shack, supplying all the fishing tours
Pretty soon I was chartering a boat
My dad said I needed dumb luck and a secret stash of Coors
If I stood a chance at keeping things afloat
That's when my girlfriend told me “There’s a baby on the way
And I need to know you're gonna go to bat.”
Well, I never put off 'til tomorrow the things I shoulda done today
No, I've always waited way longer than that
  I have never had much say in how I felt
I've been guided by my barroom appetites
   So if this world belongs to everybody else
Just leave me St. Augustine at night
  The Lord must really love us common folk
'cause he made so goddamn much
  Now, if he'd just point the way to go
  If he'd could just start speaking up
  Our oldest brother left this world for leading one too many lives
I guess he settled for none at all
The rest of us just grew apart and blamed our husbands and our wives
When anyone was asked why they don’t call
Life became a series of birthdays, cars, and pets
Just anything to look forward to
I don’t talk about mistakes. I don't talk about regrets
At this point, I’m not sure what good it would do
  And I'm not asking for anybody's help
As I gaze out where the stars dance with the lights
  If I'm not sure how I feel about myself
I still got St. Augustine at night
Oh, I still got St. Augustine at night

Go back home to your reckless dad

Stared into the rear view mirror at your face
Swollen eyes, beaded sweats
Tattoos on your forehead and around your neck

Biscuits in the oven, chicken in the fryer
 Lights turned on, cable paid
If you asked me, I got it made
If I could hug my kids and kiss my wife
One more day in this crazy life
 Take a second to stop and smell the daisies
Everything else is gravy
Starch fresh-pressed Sunday shirt
 Dinner after church
 Holdin' hands and prayers are prayed
Hot fried chicken, cold    lemonade
If I can hug my kids and kiss my wife
Live one more day in this crazy life
 Lay my body down and hold my baby
 I know the good Lord'll save me
Everything else is gravy

With words on the back, never got a chance to say
When it soars across that pond and reaches your house
May it leave you with closure and a little less doubt
Hope you eased up on the drinking, hope you laugh, hope you care
Hope your days are even better than the ones that we shared
And I hope that you find love, settle down somewhere new
And I hope that this world sees who I see in you
I know you tried to reach me, I know you tried
I know we felt the same way, but the timing wasn’t right
Ships in the night, ships in the night
Since the last time I saw you, well, I’ve seen better days
The person that I used to be seems so far away
And she’s not traveling down God’s highway, in books, or melodies
But maybe in these words is where you will find me
I know you tried to reach me, I know you tried
I know we felt the same way, but the timing wasn’t right
Ships in the night, ships in the night
I know you tried to reach me, I know you tried
I know we felt the same way, but the timing wasn’t right
Ships in the night, ships in the night, ships in the night
From this Arizonan desert to your cold English shores
I’m sending you my love, nothing more
I’m sending you my love and nothing more

Pull to the car line dropping kids off
the sons and daughters of their parents wounds
Parents of their own
It’d make some sense if some were made to me
Sometimes I don't see love in anything
And just when I surrender to my shadow
I snap out of it,
and step into the light
I step back into the light
Sometimes my mind feels like a valley
So I take it to the bar
Fill it up like an ocean
To drown my troubles in
Just to find out what good swimmers they are
It’d make some sense if some were made to me
Sometimes I don't see love in anything
And just when I surrender to my shadow
I snap out of it,
and step into the light
I step back into the light
When my dreams feel like a rusty rail
That I slapped on a coat of paint
As the layer cracked and chipped and failed
This wretched lie is all that remains
It’d make some sense if some were made to me
Sometimes I don't see love in anything
And just when I surrender to my shadow
I snap out of it,

Beating just out of sync
So many hearts in the world are drowning
In a sea of hearts
So show me what love is

Staring to space like a fools

From the black, the green renews

Gathered up my clothes, my watch, and pocket knife
It would be almost an hour before the sun would show it's face
And I tried to be quiet so as not to wake my wife
Turning on my phone was the first mistake I made
My heart sunk when I read the first headline
There had been another shooting and this time not so far away
And a child who lost his life looked awful lot like mine
I sat there in the dark for I don't know how long
Without the first idea of what to do
I walked into the kitchen and turned the coffee maker on
And stood there feeling hopeless and staring at the moon
And when the house got lively, I was working double time
Scrambling eggs and trying not to cry
Jennifer was getting Isaac dressed and packed for school
I was wondering when God left and why he didn't say goodbye
I should've spent the day with my family
Instead I tried and failed to work all day long
Lord, I should have spent the day with my family
On days like this, they alone make me want to carry on
Throughout the day I kept hearing all the details
Though I didn't check in much but watch the news
Some tragedies you know, they have no explanation
And the word ""everything"" don't cover what you lose
So I spend the whole day pacing back and forth all by my lonesome
Questioning the point in trying to write a song
And it sure is hard to focus on anything on all
And you can't get something right when everything feels wrong
I should've spent the day with my family
Instead I tried and failed to work all day long
Lord, I should have spent the day with my family
On days like this, they alone make me want to carry on
By sundown I was worn out, no closer to understanding
The evil things that happen every day
My wife and I shared a beer and talked about the future
Agreeing on the fact that we would have to find a way
Though sometimes I don't know how this world continues turning
What has happened will never be undone
But tomorrow I think I'll just try to keep the day wide open
And as much as they will have me, be with people that I love

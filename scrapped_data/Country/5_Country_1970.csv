0,Itll Shine When It Shines (ver 2),The Ozark Mountain Daredevils,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-ozark-mountain-daredevils/itll-shine-when-it-shines-chords-1200417,"The old cat on the roof
he could stand a little push
cause he's got nine good lives to live
But like my Mama said
you only live till your dead
and you got to give and give and give
There’s a pebble in the pond
rollin’ on and on
Makin’ waves and tides and ripples and rings
There’s a leaf in the wind
that don't know where to end
chasin’ days and ways and wishes and dreams
Seems like everyone is out, looking for the sun
singin’ rain and pain on he who hesitates
but it'll shine when it shines
you might think I'm wastin’ time
but I'm just a good old boy that's learned to wait
Whippoorwill's in the Dawn
Pretty soon he'll be gone
and he's got one good song to sing
But like my Daddy said
It's in your heart not your head
and you got to sing and sing and sing
There’s a window in the wall
looking out on it all
leavin’ fears and tears and troubles alone
There’s a fire in the stove
keepin’ out the cold
warmin’ wine and winters and babies and homes
Seems like everyone is out, looking for the sun
singin’ rain and pain on he who hesitates
but it'll shine when it shines
you might think I'm wastin’ time
but I'm just a good old boy that's learned to wait
yes I'm just a good old boy that's learned to wait

It sure is cold today,
Here I am a walkin' down sixty-six,
Wish she hadn't done me this way,
Sleepin' under a table in a roadside park,
a man could wake up dead,
But it sure seems warmer than it did,
Sleepin' in my king size bed,
Is anybody goin' to San Anton',
or Pheonix Arizona,
Any place is alright as long as I,
Can forget I've ever known her.
Wind flippin' down the neck of my shirt,
Like I ain't got nothin' on,
But I'd rather fight the wind and rain,
Than what I've been fightin' at home,
Yonder comes a truck with the U.S. mail,
People writin' letters back home,
Tomorrow she'll probably want me back,
But I'll still be just as gone,
Is anybody goin' to San Anton',
or Pheonix Arizona,
Any place is alright as long as I,
Can forget I've ever known her,
Can forget I've ever known her.

Do anymore of that cocaine!""

Didn't go very fast on a steam powered aeroplane,

I'll grow up someday you'll see,
Saving all my kisses just for you,
Signed with love, forever true.""
Joni was the girl who lived next door,
I've known her I guess ten years or more,
Joni wrote me a note one day,
And this is what she had to say:
""Jimmy please say you'll wait for me,
I'll grow up someday you'll see,
Saving all my kisses just for you,
Signed with love, forever true.""
Slowly I read her note once more,
Then I went over to the house next door,
Her teardrops fell like rain that day,
When I told Joni what I had to say:
""Joni, Joni, please don't cry
You'll forget me by and by,
You're just 15; I'm 22,
And Joni, I just can't wait for you.""
Soon I left our little home town,
Got me a job and tried to settle down,
But these words kept haunting my memory,
The words that Joni said to me:
""Jimmy please say you'll wait for me,
I'll grow up someday you'll see,
Saving all my kisses just for you,
Signed with love, forever true.""
I packed my clothes and I caught a plane,
I had to see Joni; I had to explain,
How my heart was filled with her memory,
And ask my Joni if she'd marry me.
I ran all the way to the house next door,
But things weren't like they were before,
My teardrops fell like rain that day,
When I heard what Joni had to say:
""Jimmy, Jimmy, please don't cry,
You'll forget me by and by,
It's been five years since you've been gone,
Jimmy, I married your best friend John.""

A city with a legend - the west Texas city of El Paso
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl
And a little place called Rosa's, where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl.
I don't recall who sang the song, but I recall the story that I heard
And as I look down on the city, I remember each and every word
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy, and the way he used a gun
To kill another cowboy then he had to leave El Paso on the run.
El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
The cowboy lived and rode away
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand
El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
I try not to let you cross my mind
But still I find there's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand.
My mind is down there somewhere, as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico
I can't explain why I should know, the very trail he rode back to El Paso
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time.
Somewhere in my deepest thoughts, familIar scenes and memories unfold
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long but I have never told
Like every time I fly up thru the heavens and I see you there below
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso.
El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in this mystery
That died there in that desert sand so long ago

Maybe death awaits me in El Paso

Through the  power of a potion, she handed him the notion, he was lower than the dirt in the road,
and though she left him green and warted, her evil plan was thwarted, when there chanced to happen
by a young miss, who in spite of his complexion, offered her affection, and broke the wiched curse
with her kiss.
Well if you've never been frog kissing, then you don't know what you've been missing, there's a
world of opportunity under each and every log, if you've never been a charm breaker, if you've never
been a handsome prince maker, just slow down, turn around, bend down and kiss you a frog.
Once upon a time ago, I was down and felling low, like a lonely frog in a pond, life was just a joke,
and I was very near a croaking, I was zapped by life's wicked wand, then in the depth of my depression,
there came a true expression, of a love from a lady so sweet she gave me warm fussy feeling, feelings
that were healing, and knocked me off my little web feet.
Well if you've never been frog kissing, then you don't know what you've been missing, there's a
world of opportunity under each and every log, if you've never been a charm breaker, if you've never
been a handsome prince maker, just slow down, turn around, bend down and kiss you a frog.
There's a happy ever after land, deep within the heart of man, where a prince or princess abides, but
all we get are glimses of the handsome prince or princess, cause they're covered by a green warty hide,
full of life's potential, they're lacking one essential, to enable them to shine like a star,
and that's to have some guy or misses cover them with kisses, and love them while they're just like they are.
And that's the secret of frog kissing, and you can do it too if you just listen, just slow down,
turn around, bend down and kiss you a frog.  ribbit, ribbit.

And a whole roll of cloth for the tick
It could hold eight kids, four hound dogs

The whinin' of his wheels just makes it colder. 
He's an hour away from ridin' on your prayers up in the sky 
And ten days on the road are barely gone. 
There's a fire softly burning, supper's on the stove 
But it's the light in your eyes that makes him warm.

Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend 
Yes'n, hey it's good to be back home a-gain 
After all the news to tell him: how'd you spend your time? 
And what's the latest thing the neighbors say 
And your mother called last friday; ""Sunshine"" made her cry 
And you felt the baby move just yester-day. 
Hey, it's good to be back home a-gain 
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend 
Yes'n, hey it's good to be back home a-gain 
And oh, the time that I  can lay this tired old body down 
And feel your fingers feather soft up-on me 
The kisses that I live for, the love that lights my way 
The happiness that livin' with you brings me. 
It's the sweetest thing I know of, just spending time with you 
It's the little things that make a house a home.

hold your tongues until after I've spoken

You'd set beside me and tell me your mind
Well my mind is to marry and never to part
The first time I saw you you wounded my heart
Oh Polly Pretty Polly come and go along with me
Before we get married some pleasures to see
Well he led her over mountains and valleys so deep
Polly mistrusted and then began to weep
Saying Willie Little Willie I'm afraid of your ways
The way you've been rambling you'll lead me astray
Well Polly Pretty Polly your guess is about right
I dug on your grave the biggest part of last night
Well he led her a little farther and what did she spy
A new dug grave with spade lying by
Oh she knelt down before him a pleading for her life
Let me be a single girl if I can't be your wife
Now Polly Pretty Polly that never can be
Your past reputation been trouble to me
Then he opened up her bosom as white as any snow
He stabbed her thru the heart and the blood did overflowed
Then he went down to the jailhouse and what did he say
I've killed Pretty Polly and trying to get away

Driving the cattle over snow-covered plains

Ours is the sky and the wide open range
Back in the cities they have different ways
Football and eggnog and Christmas parades
I'll take the blanket, I'll take the reins
It's Christmas for cowboys and wide open plains
A campfire for warmth as we stop for the night
The stars overhead are Christmas tree lights
The wind sings a hymn as we bow down to pray

Driving the cattle over snow-covered plains

Sunday School teacher, what brings you out slumming?
Do you reckon the preacher would approve where you are,
standing here visiting with a back-sliding Christian
in a neighborhood bar?
Well, yes that's my bottle and yes that's my glass.
And I see you're eye-balling this pretty young lass.
It ain't none of your business, but yes, she's with me.
And we don't need no sermon, you self-righteous woman,
just let us be.
The Lord knows I'm drinking, and running around.
And He don't need your loud mouth, informing the town.
The Lord knows I'm sinning, and sinning ain't right.
But me and the Good Lord's gonna have us a good talk,
later tonight.
Goodbye Mrs. Johnson, you self-righteous biddy.
I don't need your preaching, and I don't need your pity.
So, go back to whatever you hypocrites do.
And when I talk to Heaven, be nice, and I'll put in a good 
word for you.
The Lord knows I'm drinking, and running around.

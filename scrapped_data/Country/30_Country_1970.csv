How long can we keep righting wrongs so cut and dry

And often came into this town
So I dug in and I've settled down
No way they can pay me enough
For grindin' up tobacco leaves Making brut and snuff
Southern comfort is killin' me
I'm slowly chokin' in Tennessee
I shovel the snuff until late afternoon
Then I crawl with the traffic and I choke on its fumes
And fall on the face when I get to my room
Southern comfort is killin' me
I met a woman in Nashville
For a while we were carryin' on
And keep me with clean ones on
At least of the regular kind
Now I'm still workin' where nicotine
And memories are burnin' in my mind
And Southern comfort is killin' me
The Cumberland cannot enhermit each bee
I'm sniffin' and dippin' and livin' alone
I smell funny smoke and I know where she's gone
She's in some other county now proving her own
Southern comfort is killin' me Southern comfort is killin' me

4,Dont Go Near The Water,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/dont-go-near-the-water-chords-969258,"From the fountains in the mountains
comes the water running cool and clear and blue.
And it comes down from the hills
and it goes down to the towns and passes through.
When it gets down to the cities,
then the water turns into a dirty gray.
It's poisoned and polluted
by the people as it goes along its way.
Don't go near the water children,
see the fish all dead upon the shore.
Don't go near the water,
cause the water isn't water any-more.
There was a time the air was clean
and you could see forever cross the plains.
The wind was sweet as honey
and no one had ever heard of acid rain.
We're torturin' the earth
and pourin' every kind of evil in the sea.
We violated nature
and our children have to pay the penal-ty.
Don't go near the water children,
see the fish all dead upon the shore.
Don't go near the water,
cause the water isn't water any-more.

Least ways that's what I've been told
Me and fate had left that state
Before his corpse got cold
When California could be sold
To any fool who had been told
About the Punkin Center Barn Dance.
Mama had the fever
And my Daddy sold his soul
To someone called the devil
That he'd met along life's road
And Mom was looking like a ghost
Was gonna beat us to the coast
And the Punkin Center Barn Dance.
At the Punkin Center Barn Dance
That's where everyone would be
Dancing to Virginia's Reel
And the Waltz of Tennessee
When the roll is called up yonder
You can hear the angels sing
God is gold, the grass is green.
Yeah, I left California
Just before the Grateful Dead
Told the truth about the gold
I'd searched for in my head
And Mom could never understand
How Lucifer could bring a man
To the Punkin Center Barn Dance.
Well, times are changin', poets say
Since Mom and Dad both passed away
Will never change
The Earth will melt into the Sun
And you and I will be the ones
At the Punkin Center Barn Dance.

That's where everyone would be
Dancing to Virginia's Reel

Used to be a crazy woman
Used to walk bare footed down a gravel road
Singin' in an unknown tongue
One day I asked her Papa why she was crazy
The tears welled up in his eyes
He said, ""the Devil's inside my poor baby
You know she's been hoodooed
By the power of the voodoo
You know she's been hoodooed
By the power of the voodoo
Said Fanny always was a peculiar child
Never could make her mind
She used to slip out and go walkin' in
the woods late at night
But then one night she came home laughin'
Talkin' out of her head
She said, Now I ain't got to worry 'bout dyin' Papa
I been sleepin' in a Devil's bed
You know she's been hoodooed
By the power of the voodoo
You know she's been hoodooed
By the power of the voodoo
Said ""Fanny's Mama was a Voodoo Queen
Died when Fanny was born
He remembered her very last words to him
She said, ""'m goin' Honey, take care of Fanny 'til the Devil comes
So if you see her buried down in a graveyard
Diggin' in a grave for Foofoo
You know she's gonna Hoodoo somebody
And if you cross her she might Hoodoo you
You know she's been hoodooed
By the power of the voodoo
You know she's been hoodooed

Broke the Ten Commandments one by one
Always wished that I had a son
Just to teach him not to
Lived in the valley and I hid in the hills
Stole moonshine from illegal stills
Folks said ""Don't rile him 'cause he may kill""
But only if I've got to
All I want is a Tennessee bottle
All I need is an Arkansas bride
All I can see is an Ozark mountain sunrise
500 miles to hide my life
Life, life, to hide my life
To hide my life
I tried to farm and I tried to mine
Tried cuttin' on the timberline
Pain and sweat was all I'd find
Rewarding all my labor
So I robbed banks and I robbed trains
Lost one eye in a poker game
Gave up gambling 'cause it's such a shame
To cheat your friends and neighbors
All I want is a Tennessee bottle
All I need is an Arkansas bride
All I can see is an Ozark mountain sunrise
500 miles to hide my life
Life, life, to hide my life
To hide my life
Think I'm gonna quit and change my ways
- Settle down and live an honest day
Someone said that crime don't pay
But I gotta 'nuff to live on
Think I'm gonna move to Little Rock
Leave my doors without a lock
I might be a foot without a sock
But I got cash to stand on
All I want is a Tennessee bottle
All I need is an Arkansas bride
All I can see is an Ozark mountain sunrise

I held my breath and said, ""May I have the next one?""

Polka dots and moonbeams sparkled on a pug-nosed dream

As we floated over the floor
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers
And perhaps a few things more
Now in a cottage made of lilacs and laughter
I know the meaning of the words ""ever after""

A wise man seeks an answer burns his candle through the night
Is a jewel just a pebble that found a way to shine
Is an hero's blood more righteous than a hobo's sip of wine
Did I speak to you one morning on some distant world away
Did you save me from an arrow, did you lay me in a grave
Were we brothers on a journey, did you teach me how to run
Were we broken by the waters, did I lie you in the sun
I dreamed you were a prophet in   the meadow
I dreamed I was a mountain in    the wind
I dreamed you knelt and touched me with   a flower
I awoke with this a flower in my hand
I know that love is seeing all the infinite in one
In the brotherhood of creatures who the father who the son
The vision of your goodness will sustain me through the cold
Take my hand now to remember when you find yourself alone,
You're never alone and the spirit fills the darkness of the heavens
It fills the endless yearning of the soul
It lives within a star too far     to dream of, 
It lives within each part and is     the whole
It's a fire and the wings that fly us home,
fly us home,    fly us home.

40,El Paso City,Marty Robbins,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/marty-robbins/el-paso-city-chords-1932591,"From thirty thousand feet above the desert floor, I see it there below
A city with a legend - the west Texas city of El Paso
Where long ago I heard a song about a Texas cowboy and a girl
And a little place called Rosa's, where he used to go and watch this beauty whirl.
I don't recall who sang the song, but I recall the story that I heard
And as I look down on the city, I remember each and every word
The singer sang about a jealous cowboy, and the way he used a gun
To kill another cowboy then he had to leave El Paso on the run.
El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
The cowboy lived and rode away
He rode back just to die in that El Paso sand
El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
I try not to let you cross my mind
But still I find there's such a mystery in the song that I don't understand.
My mind is down there somewhere, as I fly above the badlands of New Mexico
I can't explain why I should know, the very trail he rode back to El Paso
Can it be that man can disappear from life and live another time
And does the mystery deepen 'cause you think that you yourself lived in that other time.
Somewhere in my deepest thoughts, familIar scenes and memories unfold
These wild and unexplained emotions that I've had so long but I have never told
Like every time I fly up thru the heavens and I see you there below
I get the feeling sometime in another world I lived in El Paso.
El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
Could it be that I could be the cowboy in this mystery
That died there in that desert sand so long ago
El Paso City, by the Rio Grande
A voice tells me to go and see
Maybe death awaits me in El Paso
El Paso City....

49,Tulsa Turnaround,Kenny Rogers,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/kenny-rogers/tulsa-turnaround-chords-2884565,"Oh Lord, I wish I had never been stoned
'Cause when I get high I can't leave the women alone
Omaha Sheriff and his broad gettin' ready for slaughter
Their lookin' for the man that turned on the mayor's daughter
Omaha honey, had a hold on a hell of a thing
Down in a hollo', every evening you can hear her sing
She said, funky butt showed me the Tulsa Turnaround
Stepped on my toes, turned me on and turned me down
Fit me like a hand in a glove, taught me how to love, y'all
Five miles of road between me and my house
A rosy-throat sheriff and his deputy trackin' me down
Well, I wish I was back at Baton, takin' it easy
But if a man's gonna eat fried chicken he's got to get greasy
Omaha honey, had a hold on a hell of a thing
Down in a hollo', every evening you can hear her sing
She said, funky butt showed me the Tulsa Turnaround
Stepped on my toes, turned me on and turned me down
Fit me like a hand in a glove, taught me how to love, y'all
Omaha honey, had a hold on a hell of a thing
Down in a hollo', every evening you can hear her sing
She said, funky butt showed me the Tulsa Turnaround
Stepped on my toes, turned me on and turned me down
Fit me like a hand in a glove, taught me how to love, y'all

See what you lost when you left this world, this sweet old world
The breath from your own lips, the touch of fingertips
A sweet and tender kiss
The sound of a midnight train, wearing someone's ring
Someone calling your name
Somebody so warm cradled in your arm
Didn't you think you were worth anything
See what you lost when you left this world, this sweet old world
See what you lost when you left this world, this sweet old world
Millions of us in love, promises made good
Your own flesh and blood
Looking for some truth, dancing with no shoes
The beat, the rhythm, the blues
The pounding of your heart's drum together with another one
Didn't you think anyone loved you
See what you lost when you left this world, this sweet old world
See what you lost when you left this world, this sweet old world
See what you lost when you left this world, this sweet old world

Goin' nowhere
And it's strange but it's true

In a church in downtown New Orleans

And I wept in the arms of Jesus

We were just gettin' to the good part
And just gettin' past the mystery

And tempt the soul of any man
But you can choose your path
There's two roads you can take
One way is right and one is wrong
The flesh is weak, but love is strong
And she's all I see between the devil and me
The gates of hell swing open wide
Invitin' me to step inside
I'll be your friend, he calls again
I know it's him
The flames are spreadin' everywhere
But through the smoke I see her there
She's all I see between the devil and me
I hold her in my arms tonight
So safe and warm I close my eyes
And a cool breeze blows
Across our bodies in the dark
Outside her reach is my concern
Somewhere I know a fire burns
And she's all I see between the devil and me
The gates of hell swing open wide
Invitin' me to step inside
I'll be your friend, he calls again
I know it's him
The flames are spreadin' everywhere
Through the smoke I see her there

It always winds up feeling more like a job interview
My momma used to wonder if she'd ever meet someone
Who wouldn't find out about me and then turn around and run
I met the man I call my dad when I was 5 years old
He took my mom out to a movie and for once I got to go
A few months later I remember lying there in bed
I overheard him pop the question and I prayed that she'd say yes... And then
All of a sudden oh it seemed so strange to me 
How we went from somethings missing to a family
Looking back all I can say about all the things he did for me
Is I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be
I met the girl who's now my wife about three years ago
We had the perfect marriage, but we wanted something more
Now here I stand surrounded by our family and friends
Crowded round the nursery window as they bring the baby in... And now
All of a sudden oh it seemed so strange to me 
How we've gone from somethings missing to a family
Looking through the glass I think about the man who's standing next to me
And I hope I'm at least half the dad that he didn't have to be

There's some folks we know, they say hello, I miss you so
Wish you were here
The weather's nice, in paradise, it's summertime all year
And all the folks we know, they say hello, I miss you so
Wish you were here
Wish you were here

46,I Do Cherish You,Mark Wills,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/mark-wills/i-do-cherish-you-chords-4054144,"All I am, all I'll be
Everything in this world
All that I'll ever need
Is in your eyes, shining at me
When you smile I can feel
All my passion unfolding
Your hand brushes mine
And a thousand sensations seduce me cause I…
I do Cherish you
For the rest of my life
You don't have to think twice
I will love you still
From the depths of my soul
It's beyond my control
I've waited so long to say this to you
If you're asking do I love you this much  I do.
In my world, before you
I lived outside my emotions
Didn't know where I was going
'Til that day I found you
How you opened my life
To a new paradise
In a world torn by change
Still with all of my heart 'til my dying day
I do cherish you
For the rest of my life
You don't have to think twice
I will love you still
From the depths of my soul
It's beyond my control
I've waited so long to say this to you
If you're asking do I love you this much  I do.
If you're asking do I love you this much. I do.

47,A Little Past Little Rock,Lee Ann Womack,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lee-ann-womack/a-little-past-little-rock-chords-1486537,"I had to leave my life in Dallas
That town will always be you
In every crowd, on every corner
In every face I'd see you
So with nothin' more than a tank of gas
I drove away without lookin' back
And I guess that's how I got where I am
And goin' anywhere as fast as I can
And I'm a little past Little Rock
Further down the line
Too soon to know what's up ahead
Too late to change my mind
I gotta keep my heart out of this and both hands on the wheel
I'm learnin' more with every mile just how leavin' feels
It's a lonely stretch of blacktop out into the blue
Don't know where I'll go or what I'll do
I'm a little past Little Rock
But a long way from over you
These headlights on the highway
Disappear into the dark
And if I could have my way
I'd go back to where you are
Oh, but I can't turn this thing around
And nothing short of breaking down
Is gonna get me off this road I'm on
Oh, and I'm still a far cry from gone
I'm a little past Little Rock
But a long way from over you

48,Barroom Girls,Gillian Welch,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/gillian-welch/barroom-girls-chords-902673,"Well the night came undone like a party dress
And fell at her feet in a beautiful mess
The smoke and whisky came home in her curls
And crept through the dreams of the barroom girls
She tosses and turns 'cause the sun is unkind
And the heat of the day is coming in through the blinds
Save all your blue skies for the rest of the world
'Cause the neon shines for the barrooms girls
The barroom girls go by your side
Like the ponies you pass on a carousel ride
And all of the colours go round in a swirl
When you dance in the arms of the barroom girls
Now she rolls to her feet 'cause she can't sleep no more
And looks at the clothes laying out on the floor
Last night's spangles and yesterday's pearls
Are the bright morning stars of the barroom girls

You might say that I was taking it hard
Since you wrote me off with a call
But don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow
When I may break right down and bawl?
Now the race is on and here comes Pride up the backstretch
Heartaches are going to the inside
My tears are holding back
They're trying not to fall
My Heart's out of the running
True Love's scratched for another's sake
The race is on and it looks like Heartaches
And the winner loses all
What the final result would be
How I lived in fear of waking up each morning
And finding that you're gone from me
There's aching and pain in my heart For today
was the one that I hated to face
Somebody new came up to win her
I came out in second place.
Now the race is on and here comes Pride up the backstretch
Heartaches are going to the inside

The poems that she wrote of the life that they led
Told of the lawmen left dying or dead
Now some say that Clyde made her life a shame
But the legend made Bonnie the head of the gang
Their rampage grew wilder with each passing day
Their odds growing smaller with each get-a-way
The end getting closer the harder they fought
With blood on their hands they were bound to get caught
They drove back from town on one bright summer day
When a man they befriended stepped out in the way
With no thought of dying they pulled to the side
But death lay there waiting for Bonnie & Clyde
Two years of running was ended that day
For robbin' and killin' they both had to pay
But We'll always remember how they lived an died

And be washed in the blood of the lamb

Are your garments spotless are they white as snow
Are you washed in the blood of the lamb

41,Led Out Of Bondage,The Statler Brothers,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-statler-brothers/led-out-of-bondage-chords-2254361,"God promised to lead His children out of bondage
He said He'd free them from Pharaoh's evil hand
He said He'd guide and protect them on their journey
And lead them to the promised land
God's children were slaves in Egypt land
So God took Moses by the hand
He said Moses tell old Pharaoh to set 'em free
But Moses wanted a way to get out
Because in his mind he's beginning to doubt
And he said Lord old Pharaoh he ain't a gonna listen to me
Well the Lord said son throw down that rod
Old Moses did and he cried to God
It turned to a snake as evil and wicked as sin
Then he cried again with an awful wail
And the Lord said seize him by the tail
Old Moses did and it turned to a rod again
God promised to lead His children out of bondage
He said He'd free them from Pharaoh's evil hand
He said He'd guide and protect them on their journey
And lead them to the promised land
The Lord said Moses I've got power
And I'll be with you every hour
Said go tell Pharaoh to set my children free
Well Moses did but the Lord helped out
He sent a plague to the land about
So old Pharaoh told him he could go and let him be
They started out with a cloud that day
And a fire by night to lead the way
But old Pharaoh suddenly decided to change his mind
Well he gathered together his soldier band
Got all them chariots throughout the land
Said I'll let them Israelites go some other time
God promised to lead His children out of bondage
He said He'd free them from Pharaoh's evil hand
He said He'd guide and protect them on their journey
And lead them to the promised land
Well they came to the banks of the ocean blue
They turned to Moses said what would we do
And Moses fell on his knees and there in the sand
The Lord said Moses trust in God
All you gotta do is just raise that rod
Over these mighty waters stretch your hand
Well Moses followed the Lord's command
The waters parted and there in the sand
They saw a path that led to the other shore
The ground was dry they passed on through
And old Pharaoh's army thought they would too
But the waters fell they ain't never been seen no more
God promised to lead His children out of bondage
He said He'd free them from Pharaoh's evil hand
He said He'd guide and protect them on their journey
And lead them to the promised land
And lead them to the promised land

A story bout a miracle that happened long ago
We hope that you'll take courage when temptation you meet
There's somebody watching you who's strong when you're weak
They wouldn't bend
They held onto the will of God so we are told
They wouldn't bow
They would not bow their knees to the idol made of gold
They wouldn't burn
They were protected by the fourth man in the fire
They wouldn't bend they wouldn't bow they wouldn't burn
Three men who walked with God
Shadrack Meshack and Abednego
Before the wicked king they stood
Bound and thrown in the fiery furnace that day
But the fire was so hot that the men were slain
That forced them on their way
And the King rose up to witness this awful fate
He began to tremble at what he saw
And in astonished tones he spake
Did we not cast three men bound into the midst that fire
For lo I see four men unhurt unbound and walking down there
There's Shadrack Meshack and Abednego in the fiery coals they trod
And the form of the fourth man that I see is like the Son of God
They wouldn't bend
They held onto the will of God so we are told
They wouldn't bow
They would not bow their knees to the idol made of gold
They wouldn't burn
They were protected by the fourth man in the fire
They wouldn't bend they wouldn't bow they wouldn't burn
They wouldn't bend

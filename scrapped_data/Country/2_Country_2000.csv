0,Travelin Soldier,Dixie Chicks,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/dixie-chicks/travelin-soldier-chords-138946,"Two days past 18, he was waiting for the bus in his army greens
Sat down at a booth in a cafe there, gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair
He's a little shy so she give him a smile and he said would you mind
Sittin' down for a while and talking to me, I'm feeling a little low
She said I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go
So they went down and they sat on the pier, he said ""I bet you got a boyfriend but I
don't care, I got no one to send a letter to.  Would you mind if I sent one back here to you?""
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
When the letter says, a soldier's coming home
So the letters came from an army camp, in California then Vietnam
And he told her of his heart, it might be love and all of things he was so scared of
He said when it's gettin' kinda rough over here, I think of that day
Sittin' down at the pier and I close my eyes and see your pretty smile
Don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
When the letter says, a soldier's coming home
One Friday night at a football game, the Lord's Prayer said and the anthem
sang, a man said folks would you bow your heads for a list of local Vietnam dead
Cryin' all alone under the stands was a piccolo player in the marching band
And one name read and nobody really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
When the letter says, a soldier's coming
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
When the letter says, a soldier's coming home

1,I Hung My Head,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/i-hung-my-head-chords-1755130,"Early one morning with time to kill
I borrowed Jebb's rifle and sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him to practice my aim
My brother's rifle went off in my hand
A shot rang out across the land
The horse, he kept running, the rider was dead
I hung my head, I hung my head 
I set off running to wake from the dream
My brother's rifle went into the sheen
I kept on running into the south lands
That's where they found me, my head in my hands
The sheriff he asked me why had I run
And then it came to me just what I had done
And all for no reason, just one piece of lead
I hung my head, I hung my head 
Here in the courthouse, the whole town was there
I see the judge high up in his chair
Explain to the courtroom what went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury what verdict they find
I felt the power of death over life
I orphaned his children, I widowed his wife
I beg their forgiveness, I wish I was dead
I hung my head, I hung my head 
I hung my head, I hung my head
Early one morning with time to kill
I see the gallows up on the hill
And out in the distance, a trick of the brain
I see a lone rider crossing the plain
And he's come to fetch me to see what they done
And we'll ride together 'Til kingdom come
I pray for God's mercy for soon I'll be dead
I hung my head, I hung my head 
I hung my head, I hung my head

My day would not be wasted on this ride
I want so bad to hold you, but son there's things I haven't told you
Your mom and me just couldn't get along
So I drive, and I think about my life,
and wonder why, that I slowly die inside
Everytime I turn this truck around, right at the Georgia line
I count the days, and the miles back home to you, on that Highway 20 ride.
A day might come you'll realize, and if you see through my eyes
There was no other way to work it out
Part of you might hate me, but son please don't mistake me
For a man who didn't care at all.
So I drive, and I think about my life,
and wonder why, that I slowly die inside
Everytime I turn this truck around, right at the Georgia line
I count the days, and the miles back home to you, on that Highway 20 ride.
So when you drive, and the years go flying by
I hope you'll smile, if I ever cross your mind
It was the pleasure of my life, and I cherished every time   
And my whole world, it begins and ends with you
On that Highway 20 Ride.

4,Drive For Daddy Gene (ver 3),Alan Jackson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/alan-jackson/drive-for-daddy-gene-chords-921418," It was painted red, the stripe was white
It was eighteen feet from the bow to the stern light
 Second hand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get 'er
 Put on a shine put on a motor
Built out of love and made for the water
 Ran her for years 'till the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood that'll never be forgotten
It was just an old plywood boat
With a seventy-five Johnson with electric choke
 A young boy two hands on the wheel
 I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp and I'd make it wide
And he'd say you can't beat the way an old wood boat rides
 Just a little lake 'cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean when daddy let me drive
 Just an old half-ton short bed Ford
My uncle bought new in sixty-four
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smokin'
 A couple of burnt valves and he had it goin'
 He'd let me drive her and we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smilin' like a hero that just received his medal
It was just an old hand-me-down Ford
With a three speed on the column and a dent in the door
 A young boy two hands on the wheel
 I can't replace the way it made me feel
I would press that clutch and I'd keep it right
And he'd say a little slower son you're doin' just fine
 Just a dirt road with trash on each side but I was Mario Andretti
  When daddy let me drive
 I'm grown up now three daughters of my own
 I let 'em drive my old jeep 'cross the pasture at our home
 Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
 And pull out that old mem'ry and think of me and smile
And say it was just an old worn out jeep
Rusty old floor boards hot on my feet
 A young girl two hands on the wheel
 I can't replace the way it made me feel
 And he'd say turn it left and steer it right
 Straighten up girl now you're doin' just fine
 Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
 But I was high on a mountain when daddy let me drive
    daddy let me drive   oh he let me drive
 She’s just an old plywood boat
With a seventy-five Johnson with electric choke

And He walks with me
And He talks with me

Is so sweet the birds hush their singing
And the melody that He gave to   me
Within my heart is ringing
And He walks with me
And He talks with me
And He tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there

Though the night around me be falling
But He bids me go through the voice of   woe
His voice to me is calling
And He walks with me
And He talks with me
And He tells me I am His own

6,The Best Day,Taylor Swift,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/taylor-swift/the-best-day-chords-754912," I’m five years old 
It’s getting cold 
I’ve got my big coat on 
 I hear your laugh 
And look up smiling at you 
I run and run 
 Past the pumpkin patch 
And the tractor rides look now,
The sky is gold 
 I hug your legs and fall asleep 
On the way home
 I don’t know why all the trees change in the fall
 I know you’re not scared of anything at all 
 Don’t know if Snow White’s house is near or far away 
But I know I had the best day with you today 
 I’m thirteen now
And don’t know how my friends 
Could be so mean 
 I come home crying 
And you hold me tight 
And grab the keys 
 And we drive and drive 
Until we found a town 
Far enough away 
 And we talk and window-shop 
'til I’ve forgotten all their names 
 I don’t know who I’m gonna talk to now at school 
 I know I’m laughing on the car ride home with you 
 Don’t know how long it’s gonna take to feel okay 
But I know I had the best day with you today 
 I have an excellent father 
 His strength is making me stronger 
 God smiles on my little brother 
 Inside and out he’s better than I am
 I grew up in a pretty house 
And I had space to run 
And I had the best days with you 
 There is a video 
I found from back when I was three 
 You set up a paint set in the kitchen 
And you’re talking to me 
 It’s the age of princesses and pirate ships 
And the seven dwarves 
And Daddy’s smart and you're the prettiest lady
In the whole wide world 
 Now I know why all the trees change in the fall 
 I know you were on my side even when I was wrong 
And I love you for giving me your eyes 
 Staying back and watching me shine 
And I didn’t know if you knew 
So I’m taking this chance to say 
That I had the best day with you today

She'd be packin' all her things
And she'd be gone by noon

And I've already asked her 
So in January we're gettin' married 
She's talkin' to me with her voice 
Down so low I barely hear her 
But I know what she's sayin' 
I understand because my heart and hers are the same 
And in January we're gettin' married 
And I was sick with heartache 
And she was sick like Audrey Hepburn when I met her 
But we would both surrender 
True love is not the kind of thing you should turn down 
Don't ever turn it down 
I hope that I don't sound to insane when I say 
There is darkness all around us 
I don't feel weak but I do need sometimes for her to protect me 
And reconnect me to the beauty that I'm missin' 
And in January we're gettin' married 
No longer does it matter what circumstances we were born in 
She knows which birds are singin' 
And the names of the trees where they're performin' in the mornin 
And in January we're gettin' married

With the moon shining bright as headlights on the interstate.
 I pulled the covers over my head and tried to catch some sleep,
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake.
 Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms,
I've been tryin' my best to get along.
 Take your records, take your freedom,
Take your memories I don't need 'em.
Take your space and take your reasons,
 And take your cat and leave my sweater,
'Cause we have nothing left to weather.
In fact, I'll feel a whole lot better,
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me.
 I went out driving trying to clear my head,
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left.
 I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this,
And all the baggage that seems to still exist.
 It seems the only blessing I have left to my name,
Is not knowing what we could of been,
 Take your records, take your freedom,
Take your memories I don't need 'em.
Take your space and take your reasons,
 And take your cat and leave my sweater,
'Cause we have nothing left to weather.
In fact, I'll feel a whole lot better,
But you'll think of me.
Some day, I'm gonna run across your mind,
Don't worry, I'll be fine,
I'm gonna be alright.
While your sleeping with your pride,
Wishing I could hold you tight.
And on with my life.
 So take your records, take your freedom,
Take your memories I don't need 'em.
 And take your cat and leave my sweater,
'Cause we have nothing left to weather.
In fact, I'll feel a whole lot better,
But you'll think of me.
 So take your records, take your freedom,
Take your memories I don't need 'em.
Take your space and take your reasons,
 And take your cat and leave my sweater,
'Cause we have nothing left to weather.
In fact, I'll feel a whole lot better,
You'll think of me.
And your gonna think of me.
Oh someday baby, someday.

Pointing me on my way into your loving arms

Please tell me cause one second it was perfect

Made you run and hide like a scared little boy

So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?

When you’re on the phone and you talk real slow
Cause it’s late and your mama don’t know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date “man, I didn’t kiss her, but I should have”
And when I got home ... before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin’ bed
I almost didn’t notice all the roses
And the note that said...

Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees

The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself
For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath
She finally drank her pain away a little at a time
But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind
Until the night...
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory
Life is short but this time it was bigger
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees
We found her with her face down in the pillow
Clinging to his picture for dear life
We laid her next to him beneath the willow
While angels sang a whiskey lullaby
La la la la la la la,  La la la la la la la

Gonna find that lady with two or three kids and sit down by her side
Ride 'til the sun comes up and down around me 'bout two or three times
Smokin' cigarettes in the last seat
try and hide my sorrow from the people I meet
And get along with it all
Go down where the people say ""y'all""..
Sing a song with a friend
Change the shape that I'm in,
And get back in the game,
And start playin' again
I'd like to stay but I might have to go to start over again
Might go back down to Texas, might go to somewhere that Ive never been
And get up in the mornin' and go out at night
And I won't have to go home
Get used to bein' alone
Change the words to this song
Start singin' again
Im tired of runnin round lookin for answers to questions that I already know
I could build me a castle of memories just to have somewhere to go
Count the days and the nights that it takes to get back in the saddle again
Feed the pigeons some clay
Turn the night into day
Start talkin' again, when I know what to say
I'm goin' down to the Greyhound Station, gonna buy a ticket to ride
Gonna find that lady with two or three kids and sit down by her side

And each road leads you where you wanna go,
And if you're faced with a choice and you have to chose,
I hope you chose the one that means the most to you,
And if one door opens to another door closed,
I hope you keep on walkin till you find the window,
If it's cold outside, show the world the warmth of your smile,
But more than anything,   more than anything
My wish for you,
Is that this life becomes, all that you want it to,
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small,
You never need to carry more than you can hold,
And while you're out there gettin where you're gettin to,
I hope you know somebody loves you,
And wants the same things too,
Yea this,   is my wish,
I hope you never look back, but ya never forget,
all the ones who love you, in the place you left,
I hope you always forgive, and you never regret,
and you help somebody every chance you get,
Oh, you find God's grace, in every mistake,
and you always give more then you take.

25,Fearless Album,Taylor Swift,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/taylor-swift/fearless-chords-847248,"There's something 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
Walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah     Oh Yeah
We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly making me want you
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
So baby drive slow till we run out of road
In this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger seat
you put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it remember it
Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
Yea you stood there with me in the doorway
my hands shake & im not usually this way
But you pull me in & im a little more brave
It's a first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless
  Ohh..  Yeah
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
  Yeah I don't know how
Oh.. oh, yeah, yeah
 You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
 Its the morning of your very first day
 You say hi to your friends you aint seen in a while
 Try and stay out of everybodys way
 It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
 For the next four years in this town
 Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
 You know I haven't seen you around, before
 'Cause when you're fifteen and
 Somebody tells you they love you
 You're gonna believe them
 And when you're fifteen
 Feeling like there's nothing to figure out
 Well count to ten, take it in
 This is life before you know who you're gonna be
 At fifteen
 You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
 And soon enough you're best friends
 Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
 We'll be out of here as soon as we can
 And then you're on your very first date
 And he's got a car and you're feeling like flying
 And you're momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
 And you're dancing round your room when the night ends
 When the night ends
 'Cause when you're fifteen and
 Somebody tells you they love you
 You're gonna believe them
 And when you're fifteen
 And your first kiss makes your head spin 'round
 But in your life you'll do things greater than
 Dating the boy on the football team
 But I didnt know it at fifteen
 When all you wanted was to be wanted
 Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
 Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
 But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
 And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
 Who changed his mind and we both cried
 'Cause when you're fifteen and
 Somebody tells you they love you
 You're gonna believe them
 And when you're fifteen
 Don't forget to look before you fall
 I've found time can heal most anything
 And you just might find who you're supposed to be
 I didn't know who I was supposed to be
 At fifteen
         La la la la la
 La la la la la
 Your very first day, take a deep breath girl
 Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
We were both young when i first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
Im standing there on a balcony of summer air
See the lights, See the party the ball gowns
I see you make your way through the crowd
You say hello
Little did i know
That you were romeo you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
And i was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don't go, and i said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting all theres left to do is run
You'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
Its a love story baby just say yes
So i sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet cause we're dead if they know
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter
and my daddy said stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
and i was begging you please don't go and i said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting all theres left to do is run
You be the prince and i'll be the princess
Its a love story baby just say yes
Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but its real,
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
Its a love story baby just say yes, oh
I got tired of waiting,   wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
Then i met you on the outskirts of town and i said
Romeo save me i've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head, i don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
Marry me Juliet you'll never have to be alone
I love you and thats all I really know
I talked to your dad go pick out a white dress
Its a love story baby just say yes
Oh, oh, yes
We were both young when i first saw you
(mm mm mm)
 Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceivin'
 But I know I saw a light in you
 And as we walked we were talking
 I didn't say half the things I wanted to
 Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
 I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
 Hey Stephen, boy you might have me believin'
 I don't always have to be alone
 Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
 Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
 Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
 Can't help it if there's no one else
 Mm I can't help myself
(mm mm mm)
 Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feelin'
 So I've got some things to say to you
 I've seen it all, so I thought
 But I've never seen no body shine the way you do
 The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
 It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
 Hey Stephen, why are people always leavin'
 I think you and I should stay the same
 Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
 Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
 Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
 Can't help it if there's no one else
 Mm I can't help myself
(mm mm mm)
 They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
 Why aren't you here tonight?
 I'm waiting alone now so come on and come out
 And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
 Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
 Why I should be the one you choose
 All those other girls, well they're beautiful
 But would they write a song for you? Haha
 I can't help it if you look like an angel
 Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
 Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
 Can't help it if there's no one else
 Mm I can't help myself
 If you look like an angel
 Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
 Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
 Can't help it if there's no one else
 Mm I can't help myself, mm myself
 mm mm I can't help myself, I can't help myself, oh oh oh
(mm mm mm)
 Say you're sorry
 That face of an angel
 Comes out just when you need it to
 As I paced back and forth all this time
 'Cause I honestly believed in you
 Holding on
 The days drag on
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you
And your white horse, to come around
 Maybe I was naive,
 Got lost in your eyes
 And never really had a chance
 My mistake I didn't know to be in love
 You had to fight to have the upper hand
 I had so many dreams
 About you and me
 Happy endings, now I know
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you
And your white horse, to come around
 And there you are on your knees
 Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
 Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rearview mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to catch me now
 Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
 Try and catch me now
 Oh, it's too late
 To catch me now
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me
Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
Hey whatcha doing with a girl like that
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
Shes cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby
You belong with me, you belong with me
Oh I remember you drivin' to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby
You belong with me, you belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me, you belong with me
VERSE1
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time
  Mm mm mm, mm mm mm mmm mmm
  Mm mm mm, mm mm mm mmm mmm
Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around
   And we know it's never simple, never easy
   Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know, like the back of my hand
   Breathe   without you, but I have to
   Breathe   without you, but I have to
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I try to swerve
People are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out
   And we know it's never simple, never easy
   Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know, like the back of my hand
   Breathe   without you, but I have to
   Breathe   without you, but I have to
It's 2 am, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
It's 2 am, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me
   And we know it's never simple, never easy
  Never a clean break, no one here to save me
  Oh,  I can’t...
   Breathe   without you, but I have to
   Breathe   without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
  Sorry, sorry, sorry, yeah, sorry
  Sorry, sorry, sorry.
 I took a chance, I took a shot
 And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
 You took a swing, I took it hard
 And down here from the ground I see who you are
 I'm sick and tired of your attitude
 I'm feeling like I don't know you
 You tell me that you love me then cut me down
 And I need you like a heartbeat
 But you know you got a mean streak
 Makes me run for cover when you're around
 And here's to you and your temper
 Yes, I remember what you said last night
 And I know that you see what you're doing to me
 Tell me why
 You could write a book on
 How to ruin someones perfect day
 Well I get so confused and frustrated
 Forget what I'm trying to say, oh
 I'm sick and tired of your reasons
 I got no one to believe in
 You tell me that you want me, then push me around
 And I need you like a heartbeat
 But you know you got a mean streak
 Makes me run for cover when you're around
 And here's to you and your temper
 Yes, I remember what you said last night
 And I know that you see what you're doing to me
 Tell me why
Why... do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside
Why... do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind
 I'm sick and tired of your attitude
 I'm feeling like I don't know you
 You tell me that you want me then cut down
 I'm sick and tired of your reasons
 I got no one to believe in
 You ask me for my love then you push me around
 Here's to you and your temper
 Yes, I remember what you said last night
 And I know that you see what you're doing to me
 Tell me why, why, tell me why,  ohh
 I take a step back, let you go
 I told you I'm not bulletproof, now you know
All this time I was wasting,
Hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taking me this long
Baby but I figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again,
But not this time around
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did - before
You're not sorry, no noo no noo
Looking so innocent,
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
Cause it's worked each time before
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did - before
You're not sorry no no ohhh
You're not sorry no no ohhh
You had me falling for you honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did - before
You're not sorry no no ohhh
You're not sorry no no ohhh
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating, intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you, oh
And that's the way I loved you, oh
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
 I’m five years old
 It’s getting cold
 I’ve got my big coat on
 I hear your laugh
 And look up smiling at you
 I run and run
 Past the pumpkin patch
 And the tractor rides up now
 The sky is gold
 I hug your legs and fall asleep
 On the way home
 I don’t know why all the trees change in the fall
 I know you’re not scared of anything at all
 Don’t know if Snow White’s house is near or far away
 But I know I had the best day with you today
 I’m thirteen now
 And don’t know how my friends
 Could be so mean
 I come home crying
 And you hold me tight
 And grab the keys
 And we drive and drive
 Until we’ve found a town
 Far enough away
 And we talk and window-shop
 Until I’ve forgotten all their names
 I don’t know who I’m gonna talk to now at school
 I know I’m laughing on the car ride home with you
 Don’t know how long it’s gonna take to feel okay
 But I know I had the best day with you today
 I have an excellent father
 His strength is making me stronger
 God smiles on my little brother
 Inside and out he’s better than I am
 I grew up in a pretty house
 And I had space to run
 And I had the best days with you
 There is a video
 I found from back when I was three
 You set up a paint set in the kitchen
 And you’re talking to me
 It’s the edge of princesses and pirate ships
 And the seven dwarves
 Daddy’s smart and you're the prettiest lady
 In the whole wide world
 Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
 I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
 And I love you for giving me your eyes
 Staying back and watching me shine
 And I didn’t know if you knew
 So I’m taking this chance to say
 That I had the best day with you today
 It's just a sad picture,
 The final blow hits you
 Somebody else gets what you wanted again
 You know it's all the same
 Another time and place
 Repeating history, and your getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
It's a revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
We'll sing hallelujah
We'll sing hallelujah, oh
 So we've been outnumbered
 Raided and now cornered
 It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
 We're getting stronger now
 From things they never found
 They might be bigger, but we're faster and never scared
 You can walk away and say we don't need this
 But there's something in your eyes, says we can beat this
Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
It's a revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
We'll sing hallelujah
We'll sing hallelujah
Oh
 Tonight we're standing on our knees
 To fight for what we worked for all these years
 The battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
 Will we stand up champions tonight?
It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up, cause we never gave in
We'll sing hallelujah
We'll sing hallelujah
Hallelujah

When I die lord oh won’t you put my soul up on a train
Won’t you send it Southbound give it a cool bluesman name
I’ve been lost on those back roads so many times I've gone blind
Losing faith in my family had driven me outta my damn mind
But on the South side of heaven won’t you take me home
Cause I've been broke down for so long and Lord it's gettin’ cold
Well I've been a desperado in west Texas for so long lord, I need a change
And for ten long years, this old place ain’t seen a drop of rain
And that wind blows everyday Lord, oh like a desert snow
Like a lost bound train, running on cocaine and out of control
But on the South side of heaven won’t you take me home
Cause I've been broke down for so long and Lord it's gettin’ cold
(end midway on Em while starting the next verse)
Along those Louisiana byways… lonesome highways roll on 
Won’t you take me where the poor man lives… it’s where I call my home
And can't you see that a breeze… is nothin’ but a change in pace
Money can’t buy my soul… ‘cause it comes from a hard earned place
But on the South side of heaven won’t you take me home
Cause I've been gone for so long and Lord it's gettin’ cold

And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating, intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone

I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don't go, and I said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby just say yes
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while oh
Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go, and I said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say yes
Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say yes, oh - oh -oh
I got tired of waiting,   wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said
Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress

WHY THERE'S NOT FOUR OF THEM, HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS. I GUESS IT'S NOT WHAT YOU 
TAKE, WHEN YOU LEAVE THIS WORLD BEHIND YOU, IT'S WHAT YOU LEAVE BEHIND YOU 
WHEN YOU GO.
THAT'S THE STORY THAT OUR PREACHER TOLD LAST SUNDAY, AS HE HELD HIS
BLOOD-STAINED BIBLE UP, FOR ALL OF US TO SEE. HE SAID BLESS THE FARMER, AND 
TEACHER, AND THAT PREACHER. WHO GAVE THIS BIBLE TO MY MOMMA, WHO READ IT TO ME. 
THERE ARE, THREE WOODEN CROSSES ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY.

Would you go with me if we were lost in fields of clover

Could you paint me a Birmingham?

talking 'bout the options and talkin' 'bout sweet time
I asked him when it sank in if this might really be the real end
How's it hit 'cha when you get that kind of news, man what'cha do
I went sky diving
I went rocky mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu
And I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter and I gave forgiveness I'd been denying
and he said some day I hope you get the chance to live like you were dying
He said I was finally the husband that most the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all of a sudden going fishin' wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well I finally read the Good Book
and I took a good long hard look at what I'd do if I could do it all again and then...
I went sky diving
I went rocky mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu
And I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter and I gave forgiveness I'd been denying
and he said some day I hope you get the chance to live like you were dying
Like tomorrow was a gift and you got eternity to think about what you'd do with it
What could you do with it
What could I do with it
What would I do with it
I went sky diving
I went rocky mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu
And I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter and I watched an eagle as it was flying

But these handprints on the front steps are mine
Up those stairs in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
Now I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard

This brokenness inside me might start healing

If I could just come in I swear I'll leave

From ""Better Homes and Garden"" magazine
Plans were drawn concrete poured nail by nail and board by board
Daddy gave life to mama's dream

now she's gone in a blink of an eye
she left the suds in the bucket and the clothes hangin' out on the line
now don't you wonder what the preacher's gonna preach about Sunday morn
nothin' quite like this has happened here before
well, he must have been a looker, a smooth talkin' son of a gun
for such a grounded girl to just up and run
cause you can't fence time and you can't stop love
Now all the biddy's in the beauty shop, gossip goin' nonstop
sippin' on pink lemonade
how could eighteen years just up and walk away
Our little pony-tailed girl grown up to be a woman
Now she's gone in a blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line
She's got her pretty little bare feet hangin' out the window
And they're headin' up to Vegas tonight
How could 18 years just up and walk away
Our little pony-tailed girl grown up to be a woman
Now she's gone in a blink of an eye
She left the suds in the bucket
And the clothes hangin' out on the line

46,Wayside - Back In Time,Gillian Welch,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/gillian-welch/wayside-back-in-time-chords-330856,"Standing on the corner with a nickel or a dime
There use to be a rail car to take you down the line
Too much beer and whiskey to ever be employed
And when I got to Nashville, it was too much soldiers joy
Wasted on the wayside, wasted on the way
If I don’t go tomorrow, you know I’m gone today
Back baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Back baby, back in time
I wanna go back   when you were mine
Black highway all night ride
Watching the times  fall away to the side
Clear channel way down low
Is comin’ in loud   and my mind let go
Peaches in the summertime, apples in the fall
If I can’t have you all the time, I won’t have none at all
I wish I was in Frisco in a brand new pair of shoes
I’m sittin’ here in Nashville with Norman’s Nashville blues
So come you good time rounders listenin’ to my sound
And then drink a round to Nashville for they tear it down
Back baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Back baby, back in time
I wanna go back   when you were mine
Hard weather, drivin’ slow
Buggies and the hats   in town for the show
Oh darlin', the songs they played
All I got left   is the love we made
Back baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Back baby, back in time
I wanna go back   when you were mine

47,White Horse (ver 2),Taylor Swift,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/taylor-swift/white-horse-chords-748267," Say you're sorry 
That face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to 
 As I paced back and forth all this time 
'Cause I honestly believed in you 
Holding on 
The days drag on 
Stupid girl
I should have known, I should have known 
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale 
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell 
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down 
Now it's too late for you 
And your white horse, to come around 
 Maybe I was naive
 Got lost in your eyes 
And never really had a chance 
 My mistake I didn't know to be in love 
You had to fight to have the upper hand 
I had so many dreams 
About you and me 
Happy endings, now I know 
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale 
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell 
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down 
Now it's too late for you 
And your white horse, to come around 
 And there you are on your knees
 Begging for forgiveness, begging for me 
 Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry 
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale 
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well 
This is a big world, that was a small town 
There in my rearview mirror disappearing now 
And it's too late for you and your white horse 
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to catch me now 
 Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa 
 Try and catch me now 
 Oh, it's too late 
 To catch me now

48,Good Directions,Billy Currington,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/billy-currington/good-directions-chords-559844,"I was sittin' there sellin' turnips on a flatbed truck
Crunchin' on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinkin' ""This is where Rednecks come from""
She had Hollywood written on her license plate
She was lost and lookin' for the interstate
Needin' directions and I was the man for the job
I told her way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You gotta stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me
I was sittin' there thinkin' 'bout her pretty face
Kickin' myself for not catchin' her name
I threw my hat and thought, ""You fool, that could've been love""
I knew my old Ford couldn't run her down
She probably didn't like me anyhow
So I watched her disappear in a cloud of dust.
I told her way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You gotta stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me
Is this Georgia heat playin' tricks on me
Or am I really seein' what I think I see
The woman of my dreams comin' back to me
She went way up yonder past the caution light
   Don't know why, but somethin' felt right
When she stopped and asked Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Mama gave her a big ol' glass and sent her right back here to me
Thank God for good directions: and turnip greens

Run on for a long time,
Run on for a long time,
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down.
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down.
Go and tell that long tongue liar,
Go and tell that midnight rider,
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter,
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down.
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down.
Well my goodness gracious let me tell you the news.
My heads been wet with the midnight dew.
I've been down on bended knee,
talkin' to the man from Galilee.
He spoke to me in a voice so sweet,
I thought I heard the shuffle of angels’ feet.
He called my name and my heart stood still,
When He said ""John go do my will""...
Go and tell that long tongue liar,
Go and tell that midnight rider,
Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter,
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down.

You may throw your rock, hide your hand,
workin' in the dark against your fellow man.
But as sure as God made black and white,
What's done in the dark, will be brought to the light.
You can run on for a long time,
Run on for a long time,
Run on for a long time,
Sooner or later, God'll cut you down.

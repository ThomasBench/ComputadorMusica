I knew that I'd lose you the moment we met
But the bayou still sings every night in my head
Though I can't understand what it wants
I love when it rains but I hate getting wet
Never thought it'd be me that you'd haunt
Can't remember your words, Lafayette
You said, ""Words didn't matter, it's what's in your head""
But if you don't ask then you're bound not to get
Still know what you said wasn't wrong
I can't turn a corner or walk down the street
Without seeing your face come along
Last born son, yeah, loaded gun
You know I recall somebody saying, ""Therе ain't no cowboys left""
But they ain't met mе and they ain't met you, Lafayette
 They ain't met me, Lafayette
Oooooooooh
They ain't met you, Lafayette
The months march away, Lafayette
I hear it takes years for the heart to reset
Yeah, but one of these days, I'll be done with regret
Didn't think it would take me this long
Still sing Delta Dawn when I catch a sunset
I remember how you loved that song
Last born son, yeah, loaded gun
You know I recall somebody saying, ""Therе ain't no cowboys left""
But they ain't met mе and they ain't met you, Lafayette

1,All I Can Say,Orville Peck,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/orville-peck/all-i-can-say-chords-4157164," Sun comes up over the plains
 Lay in bed, sleep the day away
 Think of all the things we used to see
 All those pictures of you and me
And I, I know that this time tomorrow I gotta go
And I, I know that love don't live here anymore
For now, all I can say
All I can say is goodbye
 Warm nights wane, we hear the trees a-hummin'
 Softly you whisper, you hope it ain't gone
 Sit in bars, sit on sidewalks, sit down and just cry where you're standing
 I sit alone anyway, every night in your arms
And now I know that this time tomorrow I gotta go
And I, I know that love don't live here anymore
For now, all I can say
All I can say is goodbye
For now, all I can say
All I can say is goodbye
 Count the lights, think of what we had
 Baby, I'm headed back west
 Go ahead, be beside yourself
 Drive 'til we got nothing left
 Hold my breath 'cause I'm scared to death
 We didn't know it 'til now
     I hate springtime anyhow
For now (Yeah, for now)

Every stranger that I met
Well, I went my way
But I never really left
And when I’m lonely
And I’m needing something new
When I’m lost in the mazes and turning the phrases and looking for something true
I’ll be lovin’ you
No matter where I roam
I’ll be lovin’ you
You’re at the end of every road
When the stars are out at night
When the sky is crystal blue
I’ll do the only thing I know to do
I’ll be lovin’ you
I’ll be lovin’ you
Tried to find it
In the rosеs in the snow
Tried to climb it
In a Rocky Mountain low
I couldn’t hide it
Likе the bottle in my boot
When I’m deep in the dark and I look in my heart and I’m looking for something true
I’ll be lovin’ you
No matter where I roam
I’ll be lovin’ you
You’re at the end of every road
When the stars are out at night
When the sky is crystal blue
I’ll do the only thing I know to do
I’ll be lovin’ you
Through the joy and the pain and the Mandolin Rain and the nights with the man in the moon
You’ll always belong at the end of my song
Even if I’m out of tune
I’ll be lovin’ you
No matter where I roam
I’ll be lovin’ you
You’re at the end of every road
When the stars are out at night
When the sky is crystal blue
I’ll do the only thing I know to do
I’ll be lovin’ you

He can dig his own coal something else is happening 
This living that I'm making is doing a sin
It's broken the lives of too many good men 
Been hauling coal since I was big enough to fight 
Some 30 odd shifts with out a glimpse of daylight 
The corporation likes to say that everythings alright 
Dig yourself a hole    get outta sight 
There's a dark cloud above me that's blocking out the sun 
Burn another hundred coal listen to the engines run 
One half is starving while the others having fun 
So call the captain, call the captain, call the captain, call the captain
Melinda close the door      
I ain't going down to the mines today 
I want clear blue skies and whole lot more
I ain't going down to the mine
There's a hole in this bucket I've been carrying around 
I fill it up to the top and watch it spill on the ground 
I go down to the mines and when I come back up 
I got nothin' to show but the sweat on my brow 
These hills are my own flesh and bones 
There all that I love and there all that I know
Please don't ask me to destroy my home
I'm not gonna choose between my heart and soul, so
Call the Captain tell him I ain't coming in 
He can dig his own coal something else is happening 
This living that making is doing a sin 
So call the captain, call the captain,....call the captain

To all those boys who left you broken
Ain't no need for placing any blame

In Ohio just last year
All the love I got would've been in vain
So I'll wake up for work
And tug a little on your shirt
Hope you know the depths I'd go would be insane
For a girl like you who needs trust but needs freedom
Who wants love but would be fine on her own
For a girl like you with your Daddy's mannerisms
And a soft smile makes the distance less alone

We just climbed into the backseat
Eyes wide open to the picture show outside
   I guess we really didn't understand it all
  Remember looking up at them in the front row
Hands touched together, almost outta sight
It's been a long, hard week but now the slow release
Of a Sunday afternoon
  And we were only young but they were trying hard to reach us
  How was I to know that there was something so worth keeping?
  'Cause we were
Watching the world through an open window
Trees lined up like dominoes
This old car could find its own way home
It's the ordinary things that mean so much
That's where I learned it all, from them
To fight, to love, to laugh again
Man, I thought we were only wasting time
  Out on a Sunday drive
  The sun warms your soul just like an old friend
Singing songs along that ribbon of a road
And everyone you love is sitting there, so close
  You're never thinking that you'd ever get old
No, you'll never get old
Just watching the world through an open window

I just helped them to the back seat
  Dad, just laughed and said
""Son, don't drive too far""
  Your momma gets pretty tired these days
  After a few miles I guess they recognized some places
And I listened as they reminisced
  About a world that they had always known
And how it's changing
Probably never gonna be the same again
  I caught 'em in the mirror, they were holding hands and smiling
  Looking younger than they'd been in years
Oh, through all the years
And they were
Watching the world through an open window
Trees lined up like dominoes
This old car could find its own way home
It's the ordinary things that mean so much

I ain’t spoke to you in years,
Often times, boys from this town,
put wheels down and disappear,
Mrs. Cole asked about you just three days back,
and I had no answer to give her,
I told her that you moved way out west,
to write some songs and grow a little more bitter,
The kids talk about you around here
like you’re some kind of legend
I wonder if they know a thousand sunrises ago you were eager just like them.
But if you ever decide to bring your pain and your pride
back to this side of Oklahoma City,
There’ll be a porch light on, from the post you leaned on
before you wound up on the wrong side of pity,
Often times I pray for you and often times I don’t,
is it the goodbyes that haunt you or the fear of new hellos,
You never stay long cause you won’t stop your running,
you’ll wait for tomorrow until tomorrow’s not coming.
Heard you landed in Tulsa while he slipped away,
Is that the reason your fleeing the fields we hauled hay,
The heat this July or the dark last December,
Look in my eyes and you might remember,
The weed out in Norman or the Stillwater strip,
Run far enough boy and you’re bound to trip.
But if you ever decide to bring your pain and your pride
back to this side of Oklahoma City,
There’ll be a porch light on, from the post you leaned on

Nights I fell apart, in days I lost control on the inside
Waiting for the storm to subside
Somehow scraping by, climbing every hill
Too stubborn not to try, I never lost the will to wonder
When I'd hear the still beyond the thunder
With one part moxy, another part mettle
I found mercy, refusing to settle for a hiding place
In sacrifice and second-guessing
Finding strength in every blessing
Through all the tears and fears I had to face
I supplied the grit, God supplied the grace
Claw, tooth and nail, through heartache and hell
Pray to prevail, and one day live to tell another story
One that had a happy ending for me
Parted with my pride, learned how to trust
In the chapters of who I grew to be ever after
With one part moxy, another part mettle
I found mercy, refusing to settle for a hiding place

Tall tales and hearsay and absolute lies

Keeping us all from enjoyin' our evening
Shoving its roots through the screens in our face

Conjecturin' on matters that I ain't never dreamed
In all my born days as a white boy from Hickman
Based on the way that the world's been to mе?
It's called me belligеrent, it's took me for ignorant
But it ain't never once made me scared just to be
Could you imagine just constantly worryin'
Kickin' and fightin', beggin' to breathe?
How many boys could they haul off this mountain
Shoot full of holes, cuffed and laid in the streets
Til we come in to town in a stark ravin' anger
Looking for answers and armed to the teeth?
Thirty aught sixes, Papaw's old pistol
How many, you reckon, would it be, four or five?
Or would that be the start of a long, violent history
Tuckin' our tails as we try to abide?

47,Growing Up,Thomas Rhett,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/thomas-rhett/growing-up-chords-3596153," Woh oh oh oh oh
I used to hit the bar downtown
Chase girls with Coke and Crown
Raise 'em up and shut 'em down, shut 'em down
Had a trusty spot down by the lake
Beers were cold, ID's were fake, and
Love was just a word we'd say for a midnight kiss
 Ain't come a long way, but I've come a little
Hangin' out somewhere out in the middle
Guess you get a little older, get a little wiser
A little more turn that cheek
Little less what I want,
And more what I need these days, I
Still get a little crazy
In a lot of ways, I'm still thе kid I was
Just a little less Jack in my cup
Oh, I guess I'm growing up  mmm, mmm
Yеah, I guess I'm growing up
Lookin' in the rear view mirror, I see things a little more clear
What it took to get me here makes a lot more sense
Seems like the prayers I'm prayin' are more like a conversation
And it ain't hell I'm raising, hell, all I'm sayin' is
Guess you get a little older, get a little wiser
A little more turn that cheek
Little less what I want,
And more what I need these days, I
Still get a little crazy
In a lot of ways, I'm still thе kid I was
Just a little less jack up my truck
Oh, I guess I'm growing up, growing up the longer I live
Growing up, don't know as much as I thought I did, no, no
Ooh, no, no, no
Guess you get a little older, get a little wiser
A little more turn that cheek
Little less what I want,
And more what I need these days, I
Still get a little crazy
In a lot of ways, I'm still the kid I was
A little less temper, and a lot more love
I guess I'm growing up
Yeah, I guess I'm growing up
Oh, you know I'm growing up
Ain't we all growing up?
Guess you get a little older
 Get a little wiser
Yeah, you know I'm growing up
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmmm
 Oh oh oh oh oh oh

48,Midnight Run,Charley Crockett,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/charley-crockett/midnight-run-chords-3636257,"What makes a man think that he can forget about what used to be
Be happy with the way life is, not think about what once was his
Whiskey drunk and under the gun
I'm taking me a midnight run
I'm taking me a midnight run
I'm making another one
A thousand miles or more I'll drive   to where I lived when I thought I was alive
They'll never know I was ever around
Just my shadow on the ground
I turn east to face the sun
After making me a midnight run
I tell you all 'cause you need to know
They don't call for me to go
I hear that voice coming 'cross the miles
I got no choice but to be gone a while
I say get in you better lock and load
Don't let the wind block the road
I'll be gone but when it's done
 I'm all alone on my midnight run
I'm taking me a midnight run
I'm making another one
A thousand miles or more I'll drive   to where I lived when I thought I was alive
They'll never know I was ever around
Just my shadow on the ground
I turn east to face the sun
After making me a midnight run

49,Met You,Morgan Wade,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/morgan-wade/met-you-chords-3644432,"I'd write you a love song
But I don't know how that feels
Tonight I am numb
From a cocktail of pills
I hallucinate
Think I'm touchin' your skin
I'd much rather die
Than think of the bed that you're in
And the streetlights, they might as well burn on out
Ain't nothing bright as you ever stepped foot in this godforsaken town
You were right and you left and I'm wonderin' what the hell I should do?
I'd seen it all, or so I thought, until I met you
We didn't get our books
In bed every night
Or dance in the kitchen
Drunk off of some shitty wine
I didn't get that ring
There on my hand
I didn't get your name
In ink all over my skin
And the streetlights, they might as well burn on out
Ain't nothing bright as you ever stepped foot in this godforsaken town
You were right and you left and I'm wonderin' what the hell I should do?
I'd seen it all, or so I thought, until I met you
Now I ain't tryn to ask you to save me
Even I don't like who I've been lately
And I'm well aware that I might not ever find glory
But like Hemingway and Hadley, it's not the end of our story
Sit here tonight
Alone with my thoughts
Alone with my sins
And the things that I've bought
I told you I loved you
The night that we met
I felt it back then
And it ain't left me yet
And the streetlights, they might as well burn on out
Ain't nothing bright as you ever stepped foot in this godforsaken town
You were right and you left and I'm wonderin' what the hell I should do?
I'd seen it all, or so I thought, until I met you
I'd seen it all, or so I thought, until I lost you

And chances are I never crossed your mind
Maybe you won't understand me calling
But darling it's been such a long long time
For all I know there may be someone with you now
But maybe he won't mind a friendly call
You've already made it clear that you stopped loving me
And for all I know you never cared at all
I can't help it if I sound like I've been crying
Cause darling I've been crying all night long
I just call to let you know just how much I need you
And for all I know you may be there alone
Surely you must know I'd give the world to see you now
And could be you'd like to have me one more time
You've already made it clear that you stopped loving me
But for all I know I may have lost my mind
And for all I know I may have lost my mind

Wake up, don't just lay there like cold granite stone
Wake up, we're too close to be alone
Wake up, and please, darling, hold me if you would
Don't just lay there like you've gone away for good

I can't believe it's over and you've closed the final door
And I'm not prepared to handle these things were going through
I wish God would grant me just one more night with you
Wake up, don't just lay there like cold granite stone
Wake up, we're too close to be alone
Wake up, and please, darling, hold me if you would
Don't just lay there like you've gone away for good
Without you I feel worthless, like a bell that doesn't ring
And I know you hear me talking yet, you haven't heard a thing
And I can't stand it all much longer, I'd go crazy without you 
I wish God would grant me just one more night with you
Wake up, don't just lay there like cold granite stone

Wake up, and please, darling, hold me if you would

And you find the cards against you stacked
After you are weary and so sick inside
I'll always be glad to take you back
After life has taught you dear to really care
After all the rest is through with you
Just give me a ring and you will find me here
Waiting as I've always done for you

That you're traveling on that other side
But after all they just don't really know you
I'll always be glad to take you back
After it's all over and yourself you find 
Even though there's silver in your hair
You can bet the world that I won't let you down
If you will only say that you still care
I just can't believe that you stopped loving me
I feel it deep within this heart of mine
I'm praying for the day that you'll come back to me

To buy a loaf of bread and an ice cream cone
He never knew the danger of talking to a stranger

What if one of those sweet kids was your very own
Tonight those kids are weeping while yours are safely sleeping

Long past the milky-way to paradise,

With the moon as our halo and the stars in our eyes,

Jesse Clay lived with his lady and a one eyed Redbone hound
And every night at 12:05, he'd hear that whistle whine
And Jesse knew the train from Chattanooga was comin' by on time
And we all knew old Jesse Clay got mean when he drank too much
And Jesse's lady wore the scars of his not too gentle touch
And Jesse knocked her down one night just for bustin' a bottle of gin
She hit her head when she hit the floor and she never got up again
Now Jesse Clay was crazy scared when he saw her lyin' still
He took his lady in his arms and he carried her up the hill
He's laid her down on a railroad track just an hour ahead of the train
And Jesse knew that soon the 12:05 would take the blame
And then he went to town and he waited around till he thought the time was right
And he told the law how the 12:05 had taken his lady's life
The sherriff just looked at Jesse hard, said you better tell the truth this time
Because the 12:05 just jumped the track about 10 miles up the line
And no one knows what caused the train to leave the tracks that night
It never happened before or since but it served old Jesse right
You can still hear the train whistle whine as it passes by this way

 the way they did in sweet home Alabam' 
 And the people here don't sip Jack Daniels whiskey 
 The way they do in the Tennessee mountain land. 
 I've always heard alots about the Big Apple 
 So I thought I'd come up here and see. 
 But all I've seen so far is one big hassle 
 Wish I was camped out on the okchoabee 
 If this is the promise land, I've had all I can stand 
 And I'm heading back below that Dixie line. 
 No, I just don't fit in and I'll never come back again 
 But I'm busted here and I got Dixie on my mind. 
 Oh, I'm stuck up here and I got Dixie on my mind. 
 These people never smile or say a word 
 They're all to busy trying to make an extra dime. 
 Oh I'd love to haul them all down around Spartanburg 
 And show 'em how to raise hell in Caroline. 
 Oh the things you know that I miss most of all 
 is the freedom of the rivers and the pines. 
 They don't do much hunting and fishing up here you know 
 But I have met a few squirrels and one porcupine. 
 Well, if this is the promise land, I've had all I can stand 
 wish I was down in Houston town tonight. 
 Now I just don't fit in and I'll never be back again.

  Softly falls the rain upon the leaves
  Gently blows the breeze among the cedars
Quietly my heart is on its knees
  How could anything in all creation
  Be more beautiful than all I see
With it all my heart is not rejoicing
Because the one I love is not with me
  Somewhere in between us was a difference
  Not we or all this beauty could secure
And I know now my heart will ache forever
And I wonder if this mountain can endure
So I'm leavin' for the flatlands
Goin' back - where I was conceived
Goin' back - where nobody knows the difference
This mountain knows too much - about me
  I thought it was written - up in heaven
That you would be with me and I with you
Sun and moon and stars must feel the difference
They're wishin' there was somethin' they could do
So I'm leavin' for the flatlands
Goin' back - where I was conceived
Goin' back - where nobody knows the difference
This mountain knows too much - about me
This mountain knows too much - about me

Look at that old photograph 
Is it really you 
Smiling like a baby full of dreams 
Some are comin' true 
Nothing's a simple as it seems 
But I guess you count your blessings with the problems 
That you're dealing with today 
Like the changing of the seasons 
Ain't you come a long way 
Ain't you come a long way down 
This old road  
Looking at the glass
Running out of time 
On a face you used to know 
In between the lines 
One more rainbow for the road
Thinking of the faces in the window 
That you passed along the way 
Or the last thing you believed in 
Say you tried to chase the sun down 
And you let it slip away 
And the holy night is falling 
Look at that old photograph, is it really you

Smiling like a baby full of dreams
Smiling ain't so easy now  some are comin' true
Nothing's a simple as it seems

Ain't you come a long way (ain't you come a long way)
Ain't you come a long way down this old road

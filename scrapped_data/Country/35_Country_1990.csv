0,You Know Me Better Than That (ver 3),George Strait,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/george-strait/you-know-me-better-than-that-chords-2347001,"Baby since you left me there?s somebody new. She thinks I?m perfect I swear.
She likes my body, my class and my charm. She says I?ve got a confident air.
She respects my ambition, thinks I?m talented too.
But she?s in love with an image time is bound to see through.
Oh you know me better than that. You know the me that gets lazy and fat
How moody I can be,  all my insecurities. You?ve seen me lose all my charm.
You know I was raised on a farm.
Oh she tells her friends I?m perfect and that I love her cat.
But you know me better than that
I miss picnics and blue jeans and buckets of beer. Now it?s ballet and symphony
I?m into culture clean up to my ears. It?s like wearing a shoe that?s too small.
Oh I caught her with an issue of Brides magazine
starin? at dresses and pickin? out rings
Oh you know me better than that. You know the me that gets lazy and fat
How moody I can be,  all my insecurities. You?ve seen me lose all my charm.
You know I was raised on a farm.
Oh she tells her friends I?m perfect and that I love her cat.
But you know me better than that
oh she tells her friends I?m perfect and that I love that cat
oh but you know me better than that

1,So Much Like My Dad,George Strait,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/george-strait/so-much-like-my-dad-chords-2092101,"I know that I surprised you coming home
It's not my usual time of year
But I've got myself a problem
And I know that I might find the answer here
Remember when I was dad's pride and joy
And your little man
Everytime that I got hurt
You were there to give a hand
Even pick me up
And you'd kiss my hurt away
Remember what she'd say
Boy you're getting more like him each and every day
Can we have a talk like it was yesterday
Your boy's back in trouble and he needs you right away
She said she's gonna leave me mama
And nothing on God's green Earth will make her stay
I can't live without her mama
But this time you can't kiss the hurt away
But if I'm so much like my dad
There must have been times you felt her way
So tell me word for word what he said
That always made you stay
She said she's gonna leave me mama
But if I'm so much like my dad
There must have been times you felt her way
So tell me word for word what he said
That always made you stay

2,Heartland,George Strait,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/george-strait/heartland-chords-85414,"   When you hear twin fiddles and a steel guitar,
you're listning to the sound of the American heart.
And opry music on a Saturday night brings a
smile to your face and a tear to your eye.
Sing a song about the heartland, the only
place I feel at home.
Sing about the way a good man
works until the day light's gone.
Sing the rain on the roof on a
summer night, where they still know wrong from right.
Sing a song about the heartland.
     Sing a song about my life.

Found a place to make my bed
As the evening shadow spread
Beyond the campfire light
Through the stillness of the night
Came the call of the coyote's cho-ir
And a song of the wind in the wire
As it strummed the rusted strings
It sang a long forgotten theme
Many moons and many suns
Of the real Americans
When the arrow and the bow
Stalked the range of bufallo
And the call of the coyote's cho-ir
And you know songs of the wind in the wire
As the ghostly baladeer
Hypnotized me, I could hear
Bugle calls and battle cries
Broken promises and lies
The spirits of the plains
Still sing their sad refrain
And the call of the coyote's cho-ir
And a song of the wind in the wire
The spirits of the plains
Still sing their sad refrain
And the call of the coyote's cho-ir
And a song of the wind in the wire

and I'm wondering where'd you get that cold, cold heart
set me free - sign my release
I'm tired of being the villain of the peace
you been giving me a bad time
tell me what I'd do
how come I always get a hard time
honey when it comes to you
sayin' things that you didn't have to
how come I always get a hard time
honey when it comes to you
you only get one life - this I know
I wanna get my licks in now before I go
the fire of love is dead and cold
I gotta satisfy the hunger in my soul
and you been giving me a bad time
tell me what I'd do
how come I always get a hard time
honey when it comes to you
sayin' things that you didn't have to
how come I always get a hard time

47,Let Go Of The Stone,John Anderson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-anderson/let-go-of-the-stone-chords-60081,"You shouldn't wade out in deep water
when you don't know how to swim
He told you it was over
and like a fool you followed him
into a whirlpool of emotion
spinnin' out of control
It's killin' you, but you won't let him go
Let go of the stone
if you don't wanna drown
in the sea of heartache
that's draggin' you down
It's pulling you under
and you keep hangin' on
If I'm ever gonna save you
Let go of the stone

48,Ruby Brown,Deana Carter,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/deana-carter/ruby-brown-chords-2287365,"She danced in the dirty streets, satin shoes tied to her feet
People 'round here said she was a sight
Every night when the sun went down, she'd curtsy and take a bow
To the man in the moon and the dim street lights
We held in high regard, the rose in the mission yard
Singin', ""Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight""
And her name was Ru- by Brown
And she came through shan- ty-town
Like a queen with- out a crown
And her name was Ruby Brown, oh yeah
Long about ten years ago, she disappeared, why no one knows
But some say she was runnin' for her life
'Cause a mean lookin' man in a limousine came down from New Orleans
He said he came here lookin' for his wife
And her name was Ruby Brown
And she came through shanty town
Like a queen with- out a crown
And her name was Ruby Brown, oh yeah
Some say he beat her bad 'til she just went plain mad
But I say she went where he could never go
And her name was Ruby Brown
And she came through shanty town
Like a queen with- out a crown
And her name was Ruby Brown, oh yeah

49,Colour Everywhere,Deana Carter,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/deana-carter/colour-everywhere-chords-2251425,"I used to see in black and white 
Never something in between 
Waitin' on the love of my life 
To come into my dreams 
Everything in shades of grey 
Never any blues or greens 
   I needed someone else to turn to 
Someone who could help me learn to see     
All the beauty that was waiting for me 
You  you put the blue back in the sky 
   You put the rainbow in my eyes    
A silver lining in my prayers  
And now there's colour everywhere      
You put the red back in the rose    
Just when I needed it the most  
You came along to show you care  
And now there's colour everywhere 
My life was so pre - dict- a - ble 
Never any mystery 
But ever since you shined the light 
All of that is his-tor-y   
Now I have a hand to hold 
And a reason to believe 
    There's someone in my life worth living for 
I was hanging 'round just wishin' on   a star 
To put the happiness back in my heart and 
You  you put the blue back in the sky 
   You put the rainbow in my eyes    
A silver lining in my prayers  
And now there's colour everywhere      
You put the red back in the rose    
Just when I needed it the most  
You came along to show you care  
And now there's colour everywhere 
I left those hazy days behind     me 
Never to return again  
Now they're just a faded memory 
'Cause baby it's all so clear   to see 
The beauty that was waiting for me     
You  you put the blue back in the sky 
   You put the rainbow in my eyes    
The silver lining in my prayers  
And now there's colour everywhere    
You put the red back in the rose    
Just when I needed it the most 
   You came along to show you care 
And now there's colour everywhere      
You care   and now there's colour everywhere    
   There's colour everywhere    
There's colour everywhere

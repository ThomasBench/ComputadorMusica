0,Wait So Long (ver 2),Trampled by Turtles,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/trampled-by-turtles/wait-so-long-chords-1206987,"I could never pretend that I don't love you
You could never pretend that I'm your man
That's exactly the way that I want it
That's exactly the way that I am
And you call me in the mornin with your troubles
Takin it downtown every night
I could never place the stars at night above ya
Got my hands on the ground and you know I'm right
You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long
It's a coffee stained earth every time it happens
Laugh it up honey it ain't that bad
And the afterthought rose to recognition
Like every other coffin that I had
And your Buick broke down in Winnemucca
You fall to your knees and you pray to the lord
Then you take a poke at the politicians
Nothing happens in this burnt down town anymore
You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long
(strum once til C, then pick up speed)
(I usually skip to verse here,
And your heart rolls on like a frozen freight train
You know that I'd help you if I can
But I'm just a raindrop in a river
Just a little itty bitty grain of sand
And you know that I'm doomed to repeat this
With all the bad habits that I learned
But its better than your fire-borne fornication
And all the dirty money that you earned
You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long

1,Springsteen (ver 2),Eric Church,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/eric-church/springsteen-chords-1094154,"To this day when I hear that song,
I see you standing there on that lawn,
Discount shades, store bought tan,
flip-flops and cut off jeans.
Somewhere between that setting sun,
I'm On Fire and Born To Run,
You looked at me and I was done,
but we were just getting started.
I was singing to you, you were singing to me,
I was so alive, never been more free,
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang oh-woah-oh-woah-ohh.
Stayed there till they forced us out,
and took the long way to your house,
And I can still hear the sound,
Of you saying don't go.
When I think about you,
I think about 17,
I think about my old Jeep,
I think about the stars in the sky.
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory,
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night,
Springsteen.
If I bumped into you by happenstance,
You probably wouldn't even know who I am,
But if I whispered your name,
I bet there'd still be a spark.
From back when I was gasoline and this old tattoo had brand new ink,
And we didn't care what your mom would think 'bout your name on my arm.
Baby is it spring or is it summer,
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer,
You hear sometimes late at night on your radio.
Even though you're a million miles away,
When you hear Born In The USA,
Do you relive those Glory Days from so long ago?
When you think about me,
Do you think about 17,
Do you think about my old Jeep,
Think about the stars in the sky.
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory,
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night,
Springsteen,
Springsteen.
Whoah-oh-oh-oh-oh, Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, Ohh-ohh.

2,Come Back Be Here,Taylor Swift,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/taylor-swift/come-back-be-here-chords-1190438,"You said it in a simple way
4am the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
We stumble through the long goodbye
One last kiss then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall
I told myself don't get attached
But in my mind I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you
  This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
  I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here
The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would have played so nonchalant
Taxi cabs and busy streets
They never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you
  This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
  I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here
Aaaahhh   Aaaahhh 
  This is falling in love in the cruelest way
  This is falling for you when you are worlds away
  In New York, be here, but you're in
  London and I break down cause it's not fair
That you're not around
This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
  I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

3,Country Boy (ver 3),Aaron Lewis,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/aaron-lewis/country-boy-chords-1039978,"Now I grew up down an old dirt road
In a town you wouldnt know
My pop's picked a place up for fifteen hundred bucks
back in 1964
My grandfather was a drinker
back in the day he put em down
but a war is known to change a man
And the whiskeys known to change a man but...
Thats not me
I rarely drink from the bottle but Ill smoke a little weed
I still live in the sticks where you wouldnt go
In a town of twelve hundred off an old dirt road
And a country boy is all Ill ever be....
Now its been twelve years since I sold my soul
To the devil in L.A.
He said sign your name here on the dotted line
And your songs they all will play
He set up shop on Sunset
He put me up at the  Marquis
He said you want to sell a million records boy
You better listen to me
He said change your style, whiten your smile
you could lose a couple pounds
And if you want to live this life
You better lose that wife
Do ya need your friends around?
I said..          No thats not me
Cause the biggest things in life are your friends and family
And I like my jeans and my old t-shirts
and couple extra pounds never really hurt
And a country boy is all Ill ever be....
Cause Hank taught me just how to stay alive
Youll never catch me out the house without my .9 or .45
I got a big orange tracker and a diesel truck
My idea of heaven is chasing white tail bucks
And as a country boy I know I can survive
Now two flags fly above my land
That really sum up how I feel
One is the colors that fly high and proud
The red, the white, the blue
The other ones got a rattlesnake
with a simple statement made
""Don't Tread On Me"" is what is says
and I'll take that to my grave
because.....    this is me
Im proud to be American and strong in my beliefs
And Ive said it before but Ill say it again
Cause I never needed a government to hold my hand
And Ive said it before but Ill say it again
Cause my familys always fought and died to save this land
And a country boy is all I'll ever be....

Strong as an oak, soft like leather, high as a pine, an' light as a feather

Oh, but with you I     am, 
Oh, baby with you  I     
am...
  I’ve always been a do-it-my-way drifter,   another highway, another town
Never   thought about that little white house with a porch all the way around
Yeah, I never saw me on a swing, talkin’ sweet talkin’ dreams, but I’ll be damned

You look out the window
While I look at you
Sayin' I don't know
Would be like saying that the sky ain't blue
And boots weren't made for sitting by the door
Since you don't wanna stay anymore
You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on ride away, in your Silverado
Guess I'll see you 'round again
I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does too
Yeah, we had our day in the sun, when a horse wants to run,
There ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space, cowboy
After the gold rush, there ain't no reason to stay
Shoulda learned from the movies that good guys don't run away
But roads weren't made to not go down
There ain't room for both of us in this town
So you can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on ride away, in your Silverado
I'll see you around again

Better say a prayer
Turn out the light

   the fire got lit inside a bright-eyed child.
   Every note just wrapped around his soul,
   from steel guitars to Memphis, all the way to rock and roll.
   Ohhh, I can hear em playin.
   I can hear the ringin of a beat up ol' guitar.
   Ohhh, I can hear em singin,
   ""Keep on dreamin, even if it breaks your heart.""
   Downtown where I used to wander.
   Old enough to get there but too young to get inside.
   I would stand out on the sidewalk,
   listen to the music playin every Friday night.

   Some dreams stay with you forever,
   drag you around but bring you back to where you were.

Got a family that loves me and a good piece of land
That I bought with hard work, that I earned with these hands
I do them for you...
So just tell me you love me and tell me you'll stay
And you'll watch over this house while I go away
And just promise to be here when I get back home
So we can start where we left off all those years ago
Before my demons, they took control
Lost and lonely, out here on the road
Well I'm careless and selfish, got no self-respect
I'm an albatross hangin' around my own neck
I'm a hard one to handle and I play the fool
And I'm so hard to love 'cause I break all the rules
These things that I do
'Cause I couldn't have you...
So just tell me you love me and tell me you'll stay

Turn this house into a jail, dyin' slow in a livin' hell

Hunkered by the shed of Detroit General & Company
Calling, boy come out, we have you jailed
Beside the buck-shot door, I stood still
Wondering how the hell the bastards found me in those hills
And clinging to a letter that I wish I'd mailed
Go rest easy, Madeline
I'm bringing down the bank across this flooded county line
And when I get home, we'll have a grand old time
But don't you shed no tears or be surprised
If you get the word that your wild man has up and died
Just set me up a stone on that high hillside
Now in the pouring snow, sad, but swift
I headed down the highway
Hoping that the burden of my blues would lift
And praying that the whiskey would keep me brave
Oh, but I got caught in the cold
Looking like a hobo without no mercy from the road
And feeling like a dead man without a grave
Go rest easy, Madeline
I'm bringing down the bank across this flooded county line
And when I get home, we'll have a grand old time
But don't you shed no tears or be surprised
If you get the word that your wild man has up and died
Just set me up a stone on that high hillside
Oh my, oh my
Bloodied-up and chained, my legs pinned down
I woke to find my fate in the hands of four men gathered 'round
And cursing for the bag they knew I'd hid
And the more they stomped and moaned, the more I prayed
Feeling every spark flying off of that file and their rusted blade
Said, better think it through, this is your last chance, kid
Go rest easy, Madeline
I'm bringing down the bank across this flooded county line
And when I get home, we'll have a grand old time
But don't you shed no tears or be surprised
If you get the word that your wild man has up and died
Just set me up a stone on that high hillside

Keeps a line wet in the spring

Played Springwater at Station Inn

Caught a '66 Dodge in Caroline
Got her education on her mama's dime

Halfway rusted on the salty coast

Let me hide myself in Thee
Buried in the sand
Five hundred miles from Birmingham
Rockamount Cowboy in a rock and roll band
Plugged his amplifier in all across the land
Athens, Georgia on a friday night
Saw that little girl, she could sing alright
Spent five years going from town to town
Waiting on that little girl to come around
Caught in the arms of New York City
To lose that gal seemed terrible pity
Rock of Ages, cleave for me
Let my heart forget a beat
Why do you demand
Calling me from Birmingham
Pulled her covered wagon off the BQE
Said this'll be the last you'll ever see of me
Well the cowboy laughed said I know it's not true
Cause there's nothing I could do to get loose from you
Made a little money playing in the bars
With two beat up drums and two old guitars
From the Crescent City to the Great Salt Lake
It ain't what you got, it's what you make
When the road got rough and the wheels all broke
Couldn't take more then we could tow
Making something out of nothing with a scratcher and our hope
With two old guitars like a shovel and a rope
Rock of Ages, cleave for me
Let me hide myself in Thee
Now I understand
On better terms since Birmingham

48,Waltz About Whiskey,Mandolin Orange,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/mandolin-orange/waltz-about-whiskey-chords-1511815,"Once the gettin' was good, but now the gettin's got gone
So I'm going downtown just to tie one    on
I'm oak aged and sour, I'm  goin' down by the hour
and I'm as blue  as the night is long.
Won't  someone dance with me to a waltz about  whiskey
And turn my sad songs to lullabies
I don't need much of nothin except for all your lovin'
And a waltz  about whiskey on ice
One quarter should do, number A thirty-two
a little truth from the  jukebox should make it al - right
and as  the booze sets in I'm getting high  again
to a waltz about whiskey on  ice
Won't  someone dance with me to a waltz about  whiskey
And turn my sad songs to  lullabies
I don't need much of nothin  except for all your lovin'
And a waltz  about whiskey on ice
  I remember the night she  sat down beside me, she said love was a  
ring that won't end
I was handed a  lie
Now the only thing I know of a ring  is the circle my glass leaves behind
Won't  someone dance with me to a waltz about  whiskey
And turn my sad songs to  lullabies
I don't need much of nothin  except for all your lovin'
And a waltz  about whiskey on ice

Gonna hit the road and start looking for the end of that long white line
Gonna hit the road and start looking for the end of that long white line
I woke up my baby was gone without her I don't need no home
Gonna hit the road and start looking for the end of that long white line
Gonna hit the road and start looking for the end of that long white line
Went to the bank to get my dough I don't care where I go
Gonna' push this rig 'til I push that girl out of my mind
If somebody wants to know what's become of this so and so
Tell em' I'm somewhere looking for the end of that long white line
Tell em' I'm somewhere looking for the end of that long white line
New York City, Old St. Joe, Albuquerque New Mexico
This old rig is humming and rolling and doing fine
If somebody wants to know what's become of this so and so
Tell em' I'm somewhere looking for the end of that long white line
Tell em' I'm somewhere looking for the end of that long white line

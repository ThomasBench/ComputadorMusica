0,Settle For A Slowdown,Dierks Bentley,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/dierks-bentley/settle-for-a-slowdown-chords-348845,"  I must look just like a  fool
  Here in the middle of the road
  Standin' there in your rearview
Gettin' soaked to the bone
  This land is as flat as it is  mean
  A man can see for hundred miles
  So I'm still prayin' I might see
The glow of the brake light
But your wheels just turn
Down the road ahead
If it hurts at all
You ain't showed it yet
I keep a-lookin' for
The slightest sign
That you might miss
What you left behind
I know there's nothin' stoppin' you now
But, I'd settle for a slowdown
   I held on longer than I  should
   Believin' you might change your  mind
  And those bright lights of Hollywood
Would fade in time
But your wheels just turn
Down the road ahead
If it hurts at all
You ain't showed it yet
I keep a-lookin' for
The slightest sign
That you might miss
What you left behind
I know there's nothin' stoppin' you now
But, I'd settle for a slowdown
But your wheels just turn
Down the road ahead
If it hurts at all
You ain't showed it yet
you're just a tiny dot
on that horizon line
c'mon tap those brakes
baby, just one time
I know there's nothin' stoppin' you now
I'm not askin' you to turn back around
I'd settle for a slowdown
C'mon just slowdown
I'd settle for a slowdown

Long and lazy, blonde and free and I can have her any time
Sweetest at the break of day prettiest in the setting sun

Get that dust off the Bible and redeem your poor soul

When it is the very truth and its contents good for you
But if dust is covered over it will surly doom your soul

Of all the other books you'll find there's none salvation holds
Get that dust off the Bible and redeem your poor soul
Just tell him that the Good Book shows a mortal how to pray
The best advice to give him that will make his burden light
Is to dust the family Bible trade the wrong way for the right

Eternal life we shall receive.

Oh, Lou- I'd like to let you know that I do not feel welcome.
All the birds, the trees, the falling snow
No they were not made for me.
And all this is where her heart resides; we met in California
She saw cities, promise reaching through my eyes
And she turned her self away
Well how I curse that western skyline.
And yet I thanked it for my start.
Oh Lou, though my dreams did not come true; no they only came apart.
So I followed her here to Birmingham, where the soil is so much richer
And though my aching pride might guide my hand, she did not ask for me to come.
So I wait for her all through the day, as if I wait for her surrender.
And every time I get her to look my way, she says I'm not where I belong.
But I watch her father preach on Sundays.
I know the hymnals all by heart.
But oh, Lou, no my dreams did not come true; no they only came apart.
Ohhhh, oh oh oh oh
Ohhhh, oh oh oh oh
Ohhhh, oh oh oh oh
Ohhhh, oh oh oh oh
All the snow fall this time of year, it's not what Birmingham is used to
I get the feeling that I brought it here, and now I'm taking it away.
But let's share one more drink together, before I go reload my car

And the moment that the two meet
Has now laid itself at your feet
And love is not convenient
It does not cease at your command
You might take and leave it
But love is all I am
Love is all I am
I need a boundless, soft way to commend
Like you as a temper, and I as it's tender end
And however long your fits last
I will live within your shadow cast
And love is still your stranger
It does not respect how much you'll stand
You might be love's reminder
But love is all I am
Love is all am
I need a graceful, proud way to let go
To smile and accept the things that you don't know
The losses and the gains blurred
The weight of these as last words
And love is not excitement
It's not kissing, or holding hands
I'm not some assignment
No, love is all I am

Oh they must have known,
God moves on the water
Like Casey Jones.
So I walked downtown
On my telephone,
And took a lazy turn
Through the redeye zone.
It was a five-band bill,
A two-dollar show.
I saw the van out in front
From Idaho,
And the girl passed out
In the backseat trash.
There was no way they'd make
Even a half a tank of gas.
They looked sick and stoned
And strangely dressed.
And no one showed
From the local press.
But I watched them walk
Through the bottom land,
And I wished I played
In a rock & roll band.
...  Hey, hey,
It was the fourteenth day in April.
Well they closed it down,
With the sails in rags.
And they swept up the fags
And the local rags.
Threw the plastic cups
In the plastic bags,
And the cooks cleaned the kitchen
With the staggers and the jags.
Ruination day,
And the sky was red.
I went back to work,
And back to bed.
And the iceberg broke,
And the Okies fled,
And the Great Emancipator
Took a bullet in the back of the head...

I've been thinking I'd go down and work for a spell
Oh, you never can tell it just might suit me fine
Spend some time out on the bay
But then there's always cowboy work in Colorado
And I was thinking that that just might be the thing
Make a little pocket change I figure what the heck
Ain't nothing standing in my way
But then she smiled at me
Looked a while at me
And that changes everything
That's a whole another deal
That puts a brand new spin
On this ole rolling wheel
That's some powerful stuff
That's a girl in love
And that's one thing
That changes everything
Well, I suppose on second thought this ole town ain't so bad
Wouldn't hurt me to unload this load of mine
And there's a for sale sign on a little house
I saw just about a mile or so from here
But I've always been the kind for pulling up the stakes
It's ain't never been like me to put down roots
But now I'm thinking, Who am I kidding?
I ain't going nowhere
When she smiles at me
Looks a while at me

In an envelope, inside his coat
Is a chain I wore, around my throat
Along with, a note I wrote
Said ""I love you but, I don't ... even know why""
But darling, I wish you well
On your way to the wishing well
Swinging off of those gates of hell
But I can tell how hard you're trying
Just have that secret hope
sometimes all we do is cope
Somewhere on the steepest slope
There'll be an endless rope
and nobody crying.
It says that love is long gone
Every move I make is all wrong
Says you never gave a damn for me
For anything, for anyone
May you dream you are dreaming, in a warm soft bed
And may the voices inside you that fill you with dread
Make the sound of thousands of angels instead
Tonight where you might be laying your head

Parking lots,
and billboards flying by
Spanish moss, little hicktown squares
Wild roses on the riverbank, girl it's almost like you're there aww

  From some old movie going back in time to you and me
  Every day a page turned down, every night a lonesome sound
  Like a freight train rolling through my dreams
Every mile a memory
Red sundown,
out across the western sky
Takes me back,
to the fire in your eyes
Texas stars, in a purple night
Not seeing 'em with you baby, oh they never do look right, no

 Round every bend I only see just how far I haven't come

And sank into your dreams

horse fast as polished steel
Wore his guns outside his pants

Nobody  heard his dyin' words

All night long like he used to

It ended up in Lefty's mouth
The day they laid poor Pancho low
Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to go
ahh there ain't nobody 'knows
poets tell how Pancho fell
Lefty's livin' in a cheap hotel
The desert's quiet and Cleveland's cold
And so the story ends, we're told
Pancho needs your prayers, it's true
But save a few for Lefty, too

How to let you in
In a world full of tears
We'll conquer all our fears
I'm still learning how to fly
I wanna take you higher
I'll be there till the end
I'll be your lover and your friend
I'm still learning how to bend
I'm just trying to understand
It's all in someone else's hands
There's always been a bigger plan
But I don't need to understand
I'll be there till the end

Cause I ain't ever felt one so right
Each look into your eyes, I'm falling

Looks like we started us a fire
Wrapped up in flames of desire

Two shadows dancing on the wall

Feel the music playing soft and slow
You and me and the lights down low

In tangled sheets, we'll be here all night
And when we wake up in the morning
We might stay like this all day

Two lovers dreaming of forever
And it just keeps on getting better

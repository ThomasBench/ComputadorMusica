0,Long Hard Times To Come,Gangstagrass,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/gangstagrass/long-hard-times-to-come-chords-1503236,"On this lonely road, trying to make it home
I'm fighting for my soul, God get at your boy
You try to bogart--fall back, I go hard
On this lonely road, trying to make it home
Doing it by my lonesome-pissed off, who wants some
I see them long hard times to come
My life is ill son... prepared to kill son
A paradox of pain, baby; it's real son
Lonely traveler, aint trying to battle ya
But if you're feeling tuff dog, I welcome all challengers
Aint got no family, you see there's one of me
Might lose your pulse standing two feet in front of me
I'm pissed at the world, but I aint looking for trouble
I might crack a grin, I aint looking to hug you
Think about it, nobody wants to die
There's rules to this game son, I'm justified
I'm ready to go partner, hey I'm on the run
The devils hugging on my boots that's why I own a gun
This journey's too long, I'm looking for some answers
So much time stressing, I forget the questions
I fear no man, you don't want no problems 'B'
Eyes in the back of my head, you better not follow me
On this lonely road, trying to make it home
Doing it by my lonesome-pissed off who wants some
I'm fighting for my soul, God get at your boy
You try to bogart--fall back, I go hard
On this lonely road, trying to make it home
Doing it by my lonesome-pissed off, who wants some
I see them long hard times to come
You probably think I'm crazy, or got some loose screws
And if the time comes, I aint trying to die
I'm just trying to fly, and get a little love
Find me a dime piece and get a little hug
Hook the car up--hit the bar up--clean the scars up--hey yo, the stars up
I'm walking through life. but yo my feet hurt
All my blessings are fed, man I'll rest when I'm dead
Look through my eyes and see the real world
Take a walk with me, have a talk with me
Where we end up--god only knows
Strap your boots on tight you might be alright
On this lonely road, trying to make it home
Doing it by my lonesome pissed off who wants some
I'm fighting for my soul, God get at your boy
You try to bogart fall back I go hard
On this lonely road, trying to make it home
Doing it by my lonesome pissed off who wants some
I see them long hard times to come

1,I Got The Boy,Jana Kramer,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jana-kramer/i-got-the-boy-chords-1672280,"I saw your picture, in the paper, honeymoon in Jamaica
She’s a lucky girl
You look so grown up, in your black tux, from a ball cap, in a pickup
Seems like another world
You and me and our big dreams, fallin' in love
We were two kids in the backseat, all fearless and young
I got the first kiss, she’ll get the last
She’s got the future, and I got the past
I got the class ring, she got the diamond and wedding band
I got the boy 
She got the man
Yeah there’s a old you that I knew
Fake ids to get into those springbreak bars 
Back woods on a four wheel, hanging on tight 
I can still feel, my racing heart
Now you’re cleaned up with a haircut, nice tie and shoes
If things were different and I had a choice, which would I choose
I got the first kiss, she’ll get the last
She’s got the future, and I got the past
I got the class ring, she got the diamond and wedding band
I got the boy 
And she got the man
I got the first kiss, she’ll get the last
We each got something, the other will never have
I got the long hair, hot head she got the cool and steady hand
I got the boy and she got the man
I got the boy, and she got the man

Momma and daddy put their roots right here 
'Cause this is where the car broke down
Yellow dawn, school bus kickin' up red dust, 
Picking us up by a barbed wire fence
MTV on the RCA,     no A/C in the vents
We were Jesus save me, blue jean baby, born in the USA
Trailer park truck stop, faded little map dots, New York to LA
We were teenage dreamin', front seat leanin', baby come give me a kiss
Put me on the cover of the Rollin' Stone uptown downhome American kids
Growin' up in little pink houses, makin' out on living room couches
Blowin' that smoke on Saturday night, a little messed up but we're all alright
Baptist church parking lot, trying not to get caught, 
Take her home and give her your jacket
Making it to second base but sayin' you went all the way 
Monday afternoon at practice
Sister's got a boyfriend,    daddy doesn't like
Now he's sitting out back, 30-30 in his lap in the blue bug zapper light
We were Jesus save me, blue jean baby, born in the USA
Trailer park truck stop, faded little map dots, New York to LA
We were teenage dreamin', front seat leanin', baby come give me a kiss

Working like a dog all day, ain't working for me
I wish I had a rich uncle that'd kick the bucket
And that I was sitting on a pile like Warren Buffett
I know everybody says
Money can't buy happiness
But it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say,
Money can't buy everything
Well, maybe so,
But it could buy me a boat
They call me redneck, white trash and blue collar
But I could change all that if I had a couple million dollars
I keep hearing that money is the root of all evil
And you can't fit a camel through the eye of a needle
I'm sure that's probably true,
But it still sounds pretty cool
'Cause it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets
Yeah, and I know what they say,
Money can't buy everything
Well, maybe so,
But it could buy me a boat
To float down on the water with a beer
I hear the Powerball Lotto is a-sitting' on a hundred mill
Well, that would buy me a brand new rod and reel
And it could buy me a boat, it could buy me a truck to pull it
It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some silver bullets

Money can't buy everything

Your eyes, they look like diamonds, still stuck inside the mines.
I'll dig 'em out.
And I know that you're waiting around to find the right man, you say.
But the thing about taking your time is it takes it right back, some day.
No one deserves my world quite like you do.
And it's true, I hate everything but you.
So tonight I'll follow you home
Drag my  lips up your thighs, wait 'till you open your eyes
And I'll hold you real still.
And if I can't have you, nobody will.
Winter was leaving early, that chill to the bone.
And I kissed you every morning, as the wind whistled on.
But God's humour did too.
When you're as happy as this, time starts to fly, it's true.
But I built these wings after jumping, not dreaming of the sky for you.
And it's all for you.
My skin is grey too.
And I'll lay by your side 'till everything is rotten through.
So tonight we'll celebrate life.
Make love too. Dreaming every moment of you,
Your chest against mine. My gun against your spine.
And we'll leave the world the way dreamers do.
And it's all for you.
It's all for you.
These things that I do.
They're all for you.
My skin is grey too.
It's all for you.
And I'll lay by your side 'till everything is rotten through.

In a town you wouldn't know
My pop's picked a place up for fifteen hundred bucks
Back in 1964
My grandfather was a drinker
Back in the day we put him down
But war is known to change a man
And whiskey's known to change a man
That's not me
I rarely drink from the bottle but I smoke a little weed
I still live in the sticks where you wouldn't go
In a town of twelve hundred off an old dirt road
And a country boy is all I'll ever be
And Hank taught me how to stay alive
You'll never catch me out the house without my .9 or .45

My idea of heaven is chasing wild tail bucks
And as a country boy I know I can survive
Now two flags fly above my land

Oh no, I'll sell them for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singing
Funny when you're dead how people start listening
If I die young
Bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best boys
And I'll wear my pearls

Is there anybody out there who wants to have a cold beer
Kick it to the morning light?

The joint looking like a morgue
Came strutting in through the door
With a franklin and a shot of patron
She looked right at me, said ""What's it gonna be?
Are you gonna let me party alone?""

The dollar in your pocket, and the peaceful in your sleep

Raised their Cumberland daughters in a Tennessee band
Played Springwater at Station Inn
Couldn't play fast, couldn't fit in
Caught a '66 Dodge in Caroline
Got her education on her mama's dime
She was singing in a bar called Comatose
Halfway rusted on the salty coast
Rock of Ages, cleave for me
Let me hide myself in Thee
Buried in the sand
Five hundred miles from Birmingham
Rockamount Cowboy in a rock and roll band
Plugged his amplifier in all across the land
Athens, Georgia on a friday night
Saw that little girl, she could sing alright
Spent five years going from town to town
Waiting on that little girl to come around
Caught in the arms of New York City
To lose that gal seemed terrible pity
Rock of Ages, cleave for me
Let my heart forget a beat
Why do you demand
Calling me from Birmingham
Pulled her covered wagon off the BQE
Said this'll be the last you'll ever see of me
Well the cowboy laughed said I know it's not true
Cause there's nothing I could do to get loose from you
Made a little money playing in the bars
With two beat up drums and two old guitars
From the Crescent City to the Great Salt Lake
It ain't what you got, it's what you make
When the road got rough and the wheels all broke
Couldn't take more then we could tow
Making something out of nothing with a scratcher and our hope
With two old guitars like a shovel and a rope
Rock of Ages, cleave for me
Let me hide myself in Thee
Now I understand
On better terms since Birmingham

And I'm thumbin' my way into North Caroline
Starin' up the road
And pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a hopin' for Raleigh
I can see my baby tonight
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama anyway you feel
Hey, mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
Hey, mama rock me
Runnin' from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old-time stringband
My baby plays the guitar
I pick a banjo now
Oh, the North country winters keep a gettin' me now
Lost my money playin' poker so I had to up and leave
But I ain't a turnin' back
To livin' that old life no more
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama anyway you feel
Hey, mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south-bound train
Hey, mama rock me
Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly
Had a nice long toke
But he's a headed west from the Cumberland Gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I gotta get a move on fit for the sun
I hear my baby callin' my name
And I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh
At least I will die free
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama anyway you feel

Cause the sun is too bright, the sky is too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking 'bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day
Yeah, the music's too good, my friends are all out
And they're all too high to be bringing them down
If they ask about you, I've got nothing to say
I'll save it for a rainy day
There'll be plenty of time for what ifs and why's
And how'd I let you get away
But the lying in bed all stuck in my head
Is just gonna have to wait
Cause the sun is too bright, the sky is too blue
Beer's too cold to be thinking 'bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away
Save it for a rainy day

49,Sun Daze,Florida Georgia Line,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/florida-georgia-line/sun-daze-chords-1665473,"I'm gonna wear my flip-flops and
I'm gonna play some flip-cup and
Rock a little bit of hip-hop 
and Haggard and Jagger
And throw a 20 on the corn hole game
If I'm lucky yeah I might get laid
The way that it's going, 
the keg gon' be floating
All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less, play a little more
And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke
Work on my laid back, ain't nothin' wrong
With gettin' my sun daze on, gettin' my sun daze on
Girl you know you're the life of my party
You can stay and keep sippin' Bacardi
Stir it up as we turn on some Marley
If you want you can get on Harley
I sit you up on a kitchen sink
Stick the pink umbrella in your drink
The way that we're feeling we gone by this evening
All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less, play a little more
And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke
Work on my laid back, ain't nothin' wrong
With gettin' my sun daze on, gettin' my sun daze on
All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
Work a little less, play a little more
And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke
Work on my laid back, ain't nothin' wrong
With gettin' my sun daze on, gettin' my sun daze on

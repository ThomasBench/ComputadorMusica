0,Tie A Yellow Ribbon Round The Old Oak Tree,Dolly Parton,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/dolly-parton/tie-a-yellow-ribbon-round-the-old-oak-tree-chords-1758488,"I'm coming home I've done my time 
Now I've got to know what is and isn't mine 
If you received my letter telling you I'd soon be free
Then you'll know just what to do if you still want me 
If you still want me 
Just tie a yellow ribbon round the old oak tree
It's been way too long do you still want me
If I don't see a ribbon round the old oak tree
I'll just stay on the bus forget about us put the blame on me 
If I don't see a yellow ribbon round the old oak tree
Bus driver please look for me
Cause I couldn't bear to see what I might see 
I'm really still in prison and my love he holds the key 
A simple yellow ribbon's all I need to set me free
I wrote and told him please 
Just tie a yellow ribbon round the old oak tree
It's been way too long do you still want me
If I don't see a ribbon round the old oak tree
I'll just stay on the bus forget about us put the blame on me
If I don't see a yellow ribbon round the old oak tree 
Now the whole dang bus is cheering and I can't believe I see
A hundred yellow ribbons tied round the old oak tree

1,4Th Of July (ver 2),Shooter Jennings,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/shooter-jennings/4th-of-july-chords-462742,"Alone with the morning burning red on the canvas in my head
Painting a picture of you
And me driving across country, in a dusty old RV
Just the road and its majesty
And I’m looking at you with the world in the rear view
You were pretty as can be, sitting in the front seat
Looking at me, telling me you love me, and you’re happy to be,
With me on the 4th of July
We sang Stranglehold to the stereo
Couldn’t take no more of that rock n roll
So we put on a little George Jones and just sang along
Those white lines get drawn into the sun if you ain’t got no one
To keep you hanging on
And there you were like a queen in your nightgown, riding shotgun from town to town
Staking a claim on the world we found
And I’m singing to you, you’re singing to me, you were out of the blue to a boy like me
You were pretty as can be, sitting in the front seat
Looking at me, telling me you love me, and you’re happy to be,
With me on the 4th of July
We sang Stranglehold to the stereo
Couldn’t take no more of that rock n roll
So we put on a little George Jones and just sang along
and I’m looking for you in the silence that we share
You were pretty as can be, sitting in the front seat
Looking at me, telling me you love me, and you’re happy to be,
With me on the 4th of July
We sang Stranglehold to the stereo
Couldn’t take no more of that rock n roll
So we put on a little George Jones and just sang along

Complaning, saying ""I can't wait to turn 18""

Mamma put the car in park out there in front of the school
Then she kissed her head and said ""I was just like you""

In a one-bedroom apartment, and her daddy stops by
He tells her ""It's a nice place""

Starts talking about babies and buying a house
Daddy shakes his head and says ""Baby, just slow down""

Our best blue jeans have Skoal rings
We wear our boots to church
So rough around the edges
It's hard to believe 
That girls like you
Love guys like me
Your daddy worked at the bank
Mine worked on cars
You went to college
I pulled graveyard
You must have had your pick
Of all the trust fund types
But you came back to me and only God knows why
Now there's a lot of guys like me out there
In a lot of little towns
And telling' all our buddies

They are very tired
Give them couches where the angels sleep
And light those fires
Let them wake whole again
To brand new dawns
Fired with the sun 
Not wartime's bloody guns
May their peace be deep
Remember where the broken bodies lie
God knows how young they were
God knows how young they were
So give them things they like
Let them make some noise
Give dance hall bands, not golden harps
To these our boys 
And let them love, Peter
'Cause they've had no time
They should have trees and bird songs
And hills to climb
The taste of summer
In a ripened pear
And girls sweet as meadow wind
Tell them how they are missed
And say, not to fear
It's gonna be alright
With us down here
Let them in, Peter

Told my heart we'd wait it out
Swore we'd never compromise
Oh I'd rather be alone
Like I am tonight
Than settle for the kind of love
That fades before the morning light
Silence stared me in the face
And I finally heard its voice
It seemed to softly say
That in love you have a choice
Today I got the answer
And there's a world of truth behind it
Love is out there waiting somewhere
You just have to go and find it

6,Lakes Of Pontchartrain (ver 2),The Be Good Tanyas,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-be-good-tanyas/lakes-of-pontchartrain-chords-1741654,"It was on one fine March morning
I bid New Orleans adieu.
And I was on the road to Jackson town,
my fortune to renew,
I cursed all foreign money,
no credit could I gain,
Which filled my heart with longing for
the lakes of Pontchartrain.
 I sat on board a railway car,
beneath the morning sun, 
and I road the rails till evening, 
 and I laid me down again,
All strangers there no friends to me, 
 till a dark girl towards me came,
 And I fell in love with a Creole girl,
 by the lakes of Pontchartrain.
I said, ""My pretty Creole girl,
my money here's no good,
But if it weren't for the alligators,
I would sleep out in the woods"".
""You're welcome here kind stranger,
our house is very plain.
But we never turn a stranger out,
>From the lakes of Pontchartrain.""
She took me into her momma's house,
and treated me right well,
The hair upon her shoulder
in jet black ringlets fell.
To try and paint her beauty,
I'm sure 'twould be in vain,
So handsome was my Creole girl,
By the lakes of Pontchartrain.
I asked her would she'd marry me,
she said it never would be,
For she had got another,
and he was of at sea.
She said that she would wait for him
and faithful she'd  remain.
Waiting for her sailor,
on the lakes of Pontchartrain.
So fare you well my Bonny ol girl,
I never will see you no more,
I wont forget your kindness,
in the cottage by the shore.
at every social gathering,
a golden glass I'll drain,
And I'll drink all health to the Creole girl, 
And the lakes of Pontchartrain.

And drive all the boys around
Foot on the gas and hands on the wheel
Was all I could think about
A little rust in the bed of that truck
And a four speed on the floor
Five hundred dollars it was mine all mine
And I never wanted nothin' more
I took Katie down by  the river
With a six dollar bottle of wine
Just a fool tryin' to play it cool
Hopin' she'd let me cross the line
And I was prayin' that she couldn't tell
I'd never been that far before

No I never wanted nothin' more

And I'm what I'm not
I'm sure happy with what I got
I live to love and laugh a lot

My buddies all tried to change my mind
But I told 'em that I thought it through
Well Katie laughed and my mama cried
When they heard me say 'I Do'
Her little ring is a little thing
But it's all that I could afford
Now she's mine all mine 'til the day I die

I don't know why it always ends this way, 
The boardwalk's quiet and the carnival rides, 
are as empty as my broken heart tonight, 
But I close my eyes and one more time, 
I'm spinnin' around and you're holding on tightly, 
The words came out, I kissed your mouth, 
No 4th of July has ever burned so brightly, 
You had to go, I understand, 
But you promised you'd be back again, 
And so I wonder round this town, 
I got a job workin' at the old park pier, 
And every summer now for 5 long years, 
I grease the gears, fix the lights, tighten bolts, straighten the tracks, 
And I count the days til you just might come back, 
But then I close my eyes and one more time, 
I'm spinnin' around and you're holding on tightly, 
The words came out, I kissed your mouth, 
No 4th of July has ever burned so brightly, 
You had to go, I understand, 
But you swore that you'd be back again, 
And so Im frozen in this town, 
Oh Then I close my eyes and you and I, 
Stuck on the ferris wheel rockin' with the motion, 
And hand in hand we cried and laughed, 
Knowin' that the earth belonged to us, girl, if only for a moment, 
Baby I'd be back again, you whispered in my ear, 
But now the winter wind is the only sound, 
And everything is closin' down, 
to end

Kiss all your saviors goodbye
Offer them up to the dead
No kidding you know who's right
And whose got a price on their head
No doubt I'd sell you all out
For a pocket full of silver and gold
Way back when, when they made me one of them
Don't you know they're gonna' save my soul
I can't hang around with you like this my friend
Our time has come to an end
I can't play around with you no more
No, I'm seeing this open door
And I know you saw right through me
Afraid I'm taking you for a ride
But when you're dead you're dead
When you're gone you're gone
I got my conscience at both my sides
I set out to disappear
And out there I found a new home
But listen Jack, you're on the wrong side of the tracks
At least now I don't have to walk it all alone
Can you hear the sound of the crawling flesh?
Now can you smell the burning desire?
This place is too small to hide
All the ghosts that's kicking around inside
What this town was entirely built upon
You can find it right between the eyes
Its a bullet hole that'll steal your soul
And roll you for your money and your diamonds
I set out to disappear
And out there I found a new home
But listen Jack, you're on the wrong side of the tracks
At least now I don't have to walk it all alone

All dressed in white, going to the church that night
She had his box of letters in the passenger seat
Six pins and a shoe, something borrowed, something blue
And when the church doors opened up wide
She put her veil down trying to hide the tears
She heard the trumpets from the military band
And the flowers fell out of her hands
Baby, why'd you leave me, why'd you have to go
I was counting on forever, now I'll never know
I can't even breathe
It's like I'm looking from a distance, standing in the background
Everybody's saying, he's not coming home now,
This can't be happening to me
This is just a dream
The preacher man said let us bow our head and pray
Lord please lift his soul and heal this hurt
Then the congregation all stood up
And sang the saddest song that she ever heard
Then they handed her a folded up flag
And she held on to all she had left of him
And then guns rang one last shot
And it felt like a bullet in her heart
Baby, why'd you leave me, why'd you have to go

And I wander, and lay in whatever old bed

But we'd try our best anyway

I left them motherless, fatherless
Their souls dangling inside-out from their mouths
But it's never enough
I want you
Carved your name across three counties
Ground it in with bloody hides
Their broken necks will line the ditch
Till you stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it
Stop this madness
I want you
I have waited with a glacier's patience
Smashed every transformer with every trailer
Till nothing was standing
Sixty five miles wide
Still you are nowhere, still you are nowhere
Nowhere in sight
Come out to meet me
Run out to meet me
Come into the light
Climb the boxcars to the engine, through the smoke and to the sky
Your rails have always outrun mine. So I...
Picked them up and crashed them down
In a moment close to now
Cause I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss
I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss
How you'd sigh yourself to sleep
When I'd rake the springtime
Across your sheets
My love, I am the speed of sound
I left the motherless, fatherless
Their souls dangling inside out from their mouths
But it's never enough
My love, I'm an owl on the sill in the evening
But morning finds you
Still warm and breathing
This tornado loves you, this tornado loves you
This tornado loves you, this tornado loves you, 
This tornado loves you...
What will make you believe me?

Everything's so easy for Pauline
Ancient strings set feet a light to speed to her such mild grace
No monument of tacky gold
They smoothed her hair with cinnamon waves
And they placed an ingot in her breast
to burn cool and collected
Fate holds her firm in its cradle
and then rolls her for a tender pause to savor
Everything's so easy for Pauline
Girl with the parking lot eyes
Margaret is the fragments of a name
Her bravery is mistaken for the thrashing in the lake
Of the make-believe monster whose picture was faked
Margaret is the fragments of a name
Her love pours like a fountain Her love steams like rage
Her jaw aches from wanting and she's sick from chlorine
But she'll never be as clean
As the cool side of satin, Pauline
Pauliiiiiine
Two girls ride the blue line
Two girls walk down the same street
One left her sweater sittin' on the train
The other lost three fingers at the cannery
Everything's so easy for Pauliiiiiine

A young man ‘bout 21,
no different than you or I
He’s catchin’ catfish,
and gettin’ drunk
But Uncle Sam called,
he called him up,
Sent him out to Vietnam,
That young man,
Got his life turned upside down,
Turned his smile into a frown,
Robbed that king of his crown,
For an ideal he didn’t even know about,
He was gamblin’ at the wagon,when that army man showed up,
And he flashed that pen and paper,
And ole Flukie he signed up,
There’s gonna be a big time,
In the jungle,
Gonna be a firefight,
Gonna be a rumble,
Send me out to Vietnam,
I’ll fight ten men,
I got nothin’ left in the States for me,
I wanna see the world you see,
I know that Uncle Sam needs me,
To fight for an ideal I know nothing about.
Oh the drop point was dusty and the drill sergeant was loud,
And he could not see the corpses,
for the ragin’ dust cloud
Grab your duffle bags,
head to the checkpoint
Welcome to Vietnam boys,
you’re in for a hell of a fight,
Take it from the ones who know.
The army moves slow,
Hurry up and wait,
don’t sleep late,
And learn to hate your brother,
Before you hate your foe,
On patrol out in the rice fields,
Them choppers flew low,
Glancing for the hand signal,
To tell you where to go,
Then the bombs started fallin’
And they pounded his brain,
And he thought about Eutaw,
And who was to blame,
For sendin’ him to Vietnam,

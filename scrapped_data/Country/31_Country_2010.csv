If you look real close, you can see it right there
A little tin roof bar down a path you have to follow
From a treasure map with the edges burnt
From a few too many beers
We'll pull the ropes off the boat
We'll throw them up on the dock
We'll let the stars be our guide
No, we don't need no clock
We'll set sail
Yeah, I'll see you there
Waving your hair with that t-shirt on
Dead men tell no tales
It's like nowhere else you've ever been
We'll write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall, it'll still be there
Next time we come back, girl
To the bar at the end of the world
In that old seashell you can hear the ocean
You can hear the waves crash whisper in your ear
Little glow in the night, it's the last place open
And the house drink is a beautiful thing called make me disappear
We'll pull the ropes off the boat
We'll throw them up on the dock
We'll let the stars be our guide
No, we don't need no clock
We'll set sail
Yeah, I'll see you there
Waving your hair with that t-shirt on
Dead men tell no tales
It's like nowhere else you've ever been
We'll write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall, it'll still be there
Next time we come back, girl
To the bar at the end of the world
There ain't no empty glasses, they're playing driftaway
That's where the magic happens, back up in that little bay
We'll set sail
Yeah, I'll see you there
Waving your hair with that t-shirt on
Dead men tell no tales
It's like nowhere else you've ever been
We'll write your name on a dollar bill
Put it on a wall, it'll still be there
Next time we come back, girl
To the bar at the end of the world

 Strong as a fifth of whiskey
 Steady as a Tom Petty track

  Not just the gravel one we're travelin' on girl

 The feeling you can know so much
 Without knowing anything at all

 That never bring you back to me

There's greener grass in the neighbors yard.
A bigger house and a faster car,
We ain't happy where we are.

And your eyes, they look like diamonds still stuck inside the mines, I'll dig 'em out
And I know that you're waiting around to find the right man, you say
But the thing about taking your time, it takes it right back someday
And no one deserves my world quite like you do
And it's true, I hate everything but you
So tonight I'll follow you home, start up a fire that'll keep us both warm and I'll
Drag my lips up your thighs, wait 'til you open your eyes when I'll hold you real still
And if I can't have you, nobody will
Winter was leaving early, that chill to the bone
And I kissed you every morning, as the wind whistled on, but God's humour did too
But when you're as happy as this time starts to fly, it's true
But I built these wings after jumping, not dreaming of the sky for you
And it's all for you, my skin is grey too
And I'll lay by your side 'till everything is rotten through
So tonight we'll celebrate life, eat the best food and we'll drink the best wine
And we'll make love too, dreaming every moment of you 
Your chest against mine, my gun against your spine
And we'll leave the world the way     dreamers do

25,Country Boy (ver 2),Aaron Lewis,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/aaron-lewis/country-boy-chords-1017324,"Now I grew up down an old dirt road
In a town you wouldnt know
My pop picked a place up for fifteen hundred bucks
Back in 1964
My grandfather was a drinker
Back in the day he put em down
But a war is known to change a man
And the whiskeys known to change a man but.....
Thats not me
I rarely drink from the bottle but Ill smoke a little weed
I still live in the sticks where you wouldnt go
In a town of twelve hundred off an old dirt road
And a country boy is all Ill ever be....
Now its been twelve years since I sold my soul
To the devil in L.A.
He said sign your name here on the dotted line
And your songs they all will play
He set up shop on Sunset
He put me up at the  Marquis
He said you want to sell a million records boy
You better listen to me
He said change your style, whiten your smile 
you could lose a couple pounds
And if you want to live this life
You better lose that wife
Do ya need your friends around?
I said..          No thats not me
Cause the biggest things in life are your friends and family
And I like my jeans and my old tshirts
and couple extra pounds never really hurt
And a country boy is all Ill ever be....
Cause Hank taught me just how to stay alive
Youll never catch me out the house without my .9 or .45
I got a big orange tracker and a diesel truck
My idea of heaven is chasing white tail bucks
And as a country boy I know I can survive
Now two flags fly above my land
That really sum up how I feel
One is the colors that fly high and proud
The red, the white, the blue
The other ones got a rattlesnake 
with a simple statement made
""Don't Tread On Me"" is what is says 
and I'll take that to my grave
Because.....    this is me
Im proud to be American and strong in my beliefs
And Ive said it before but Ill say it again
Cause I never needed a government to hold my hand
And Ive said it before but Ill say it again
Cause my familys always fought and died to save this land
And a country boy is all I'll ever be....

You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale 
   Today was a fairytale I wore a dress 
You wore a dark grey t-shirt
You told me i was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Can you feel this magic in the air 
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must of been the way

Its now getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense till the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

Fell in love when I saw you standing there

And goggles to shield the elements from their eyes

You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you
Come on baby with me

Turned to crying and screaming, ""Why?""
Flowers piled up in the worst way

And it's about to be Halloween 
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day when I kissed your face
I whispered in your ear

Out of this curtained room in this hospital gray
We'll just disappear
Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here

What if I kept the hand me downs you won't grow into?

So you buy her a drink, before too long
You're out on the floor in the middle of a song
About that time her ex shows up

He's a big ol' jacked up S.O.B

They're there even when you don't see 'em as much
Cause you moved away or you fell in love

If I had his money... I'd do things my way
But little they know... that it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten... with a satisfied mind
Once I was waiting in fortune and fame; 
Everything that I dreamed for, to get a start in life's game. 
Then suddenly it happened, I lost every dime, 
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
Or a friend when you're lonely or a love that's grown cold
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man, with a satisfied mind.
When life has ended, and my time has run out, 
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt. 
But there's one thing for certain, when it comes my time, 
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.

To American honey
There's a wild, wild whisper blowin' in the wind
Callin' out my name like a long lost friend
Oh, I miss those days as the years go by
Oh, nothin' sweeter than summertime
And American honey
And American honey

 I hope you're the end of my story 
 I hope you're as far as it goes 
 I hope you're the last word I ever utter 
 It's never your time to go 
 Sometimes this road that we travel 
 Feels like it's leading us on 
 Spinning our wheels just stirs up the gravel 
 Before you know it, it's gone
 I hope you're the end of my story 
 I hope you're as far as it goes 
 I hope you're the last word I ever utter 
 It's never your time to go 
 I'll keep on turning the pages 
 Oh what a story to tell 
 You'll still be my sweetheart when everything ages 
 You'll be the last book on my shelf 
 I hope you're the end of my story 
 I hope you're as far as it goes 
 I hope you're the last word I ever utter 
 It's never your time to go 
 I hope you're the last word I ever utter 
 It's never your time to go

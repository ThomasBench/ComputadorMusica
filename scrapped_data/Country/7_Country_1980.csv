0,God Must Be A Cowboy,Dan Seals,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/dan-seals/god-must-be-a-cowboy-chords-2331737,"A campfire some coffee from a tin cup in my hand
Sure warms the fingers when it's cold
A-playing an old guitar a friend I understand
Sure smoothes the wrinkles in my soul
Sleeping in the moonlight a blanket for the bed
Leaves a peaceful feeling in my mind
Waking up in the morning with an eagle overhead
Makes me want to fly away before my time
And I think God must be a cowboy at heart
He made wide-open spaces from the start
He made grass and trees and mountains and a horse to be a friend
And trails to lead old cowboys home again
Night life and big cities is alright for awhile
Sure makes you feel good when you're there
But the country's so pretty it goes on and on for miles
Takes away my troubles and my cares
And I think God must be a cowboy at heart
He made wide-open spaces from the start
He made grass and trees and mountains and a horse to be a friend
And trails to lead old cowboys home again
And trails to lead old cowboys home again

makes you think that life has passed you by
There are days when you wish the world would stop, woman

it’s then I know exactly how you feel
Hey, it’s July, and the winter sun is shining

Don’t you feel the new day has begun 
Can’t you hear the bees making honey, woman
in the spotted gums where the bell birds ring

read all about what’s goin’ on in hell
They don’t care to tell the world of kindness

There’s all the colours of the rainbow in the garden, woman

Every summer
To visit my granny in her ante bellum world
I'd run barefooted all day long
Climbing trees free as a song
One day I happened catch myself a squirrel
I stuffed him down in an old shoebox
Punched a couple holes in the top
and when Sunday came I snuck him into church
I was sittin way back in the very last pew
Showin him to my good buddy Hugh
When that squirrel got loose
And went totally berserk!
Well what happened next is hard to tell
As the choir sang ""I Surrender All""
Harv leaped to his feet and said
""Somethin's got a hold on me! YEOW!""
The day the squirrel went berserk
In the First Self-Righteous Church
In that sleepy little town of Pascagoula
It was a fight for survival
That broke out in revival
They were jumpin pews and shouting Hallelujah!
Well, Harv hit the aisles dancin' and screamin'
Some thought he had religion
Others thought he had a demon
And Harv thought he had a weed eater loose in his Fruit-Of-The-Looms
He fell to his knees to plead and beg
And the squirrel ran out of his britches leg
Unobserved, to the other side of the room
All the way down to the amen pew
Where sat Sister Bertha better-than-you
Who'd been watchin' all the commotion with sadistic glee
should've seen that look in her eyes
When that squirrel jumped her garters and crossed her thighs
She jumped to her feet and said ""Lord have mercy on me""
As the squirrel made laps inside her dress
Was when she talked about her love life
And then she started naming names!
The day the squirrel went berserk
In the First Self-Righteous Church
In that sleepy little town of Pascagoula
It was a fight for survival
That broke out in revival
They were jumpin pews and shouting Hallelujah!
Well seven deacons and then the pastor got saved
And 50 volunteered for missions in the Congo on the spot
And even without an invitation
There were at least 500 rededications
And we all got re-baptized whether we needed it or not
Now you've heard the Bible stories I guess
Of how He parted the waters for Moses to pass
All the miracles God has brought to this ol' world
But the one I'll remember to my dyin day
Is how he put that church back on the narrow way
With a half-crazed Mississippi squirrel
The day the squirrel went berserk
In the First Self-Righteous Church
In that sleepy little town of Pascagoula
It was a fight for survival
That broke out in revival
They were jumpin pews and shouting Hallelujah! (2x)

Park on a back road along the highway side

There'd be music playin', people laughin' all the time

An angel when she smiled

She'd go away when the grass turned green

Baby Blue was the color of her eyes
Baby Blue, like the Colorado skies
Like a breath of Spring, she came and left
And I still don't know why
So, here's to you, and whoever holds my Baby Blue, tonight
She brought colors to my life
That my eyes had never touched
When she taught me how to care
I never cared so much
I try not to think of her
But I fall asleep and do
And drift off where the grass is green
And the sky is Baby Blue

A mailbox barely standing by the driveway, I can almost read the name
A swing-set and forgotten toys where little girls and boys played happy games
Everything I ever cared about is gone now,  but the memory still remains
The old man from the house across the street asked, “How’s it goin’” and I said “Fine”
But the expression on his face would make me think, that he could almost read my mind.
That Johnson boy from down the road was askin’ if the kids could come and play
Lord I wish I could have told him yes, but I just  said, I guess no, not today.
I just came home to count the memories
That I’ve been counting in my mind
I just came home to count the memories
Of a better day and time
All the birds that sang their pretty songs aren’t singing like they did when we were here
Cause there’s no happiness in music if somebody isn’t close enough to care
I picked a ragged daisy from it’s home out in the corner the yard
She loves me - She loves me not, Now I don’t have to wonder anymore
I just came home to count the memories
That I’ve been counting in my mind
I just came home to count the memories

45,She Keeps The Home Fires Burning (ver 2),Ronnie Milsap,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ronnie-milsap/she-keeps-the-home-fires-burning-chords-1784455,"Crack of dawn I hit the road  set my shoulders for the heavy load
Coffee leaking through the paper sack
He's got me eight hours she's got me after that
I can't wait 'til it's quitting time
She keeps the home fires burning
While I'm out earning a living in a world
That's known for its pouring rain
She keeps the home fires burning
Ooh and it's her warm loving that keeps me returning again
No more credit on my credit card
She's my one light when the world goes dark
Tomorrow it's the same old grind
She keeps the home fires burning
While I'm out earning a living in a world
That's known for its pouring rain
She keeps the home fires burning
Ooh and it's her warm loving that keeps me returning again

47,Maybe Your Babys Got The Blues,The Judds,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-judds/maybe-your-babys-got-the-blues-chords-2109291,"If you hear her cry at night  better turn on your light,
Maybe your baby's got the blues,
When she says there's nothing wrong, she just wants to be alone,
You can bet your baby's got the blues,
Women like the men to make the first move, 
and touch them like they use to,
When there's aching in her heart only tenderness can find,
Women like the men to make them feel alive,
and keep her apron strings untied,
Yes women like men to love them through the blues some times,
When her days all run the same, 
And she says she thinks she needs a change,
Maybe your baby's got the blues
If she says she's just a wife and so far from the glamorus life
You can bet your baby's got the blues
Women like the men to make the first move, 
and touch them like they use to,
When there's aching in her heart only tenderness can find,
Women like the men to make them feel alive,
and keep her apron strings untied,
Yes women like men to love them through the blues some times,
Yes women like men to love them through the blues some times,

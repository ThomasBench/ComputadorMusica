0,Wagon Wheel,Darius Rucker,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/darius-rucker/wagon-wheel-chords-1215756,"Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hopin' for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight
So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Rock me momma any way you feel
Hey,  momma rock me
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Rock me momma like a south bound train
Hey,  momma rock me
Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
I lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more
So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Rock me momma any way you feel
Hey,  momma rock me
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Rock me momma like a south bound train
Hey,  momma rock me
Walkin' to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I gotta get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I died in Raleigh at least I will die free
So rock me momma like a wagon wheel
Rock me momma any way you feel
Hey,  momma rock me
Oh, rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Rock me momma like a south bound train
Hey,  momma rock me
Oh, so rock me momma like a wagon wheel
    Ohhhhhhhhhhhh, I wanna feel
Hey,  momma rock me
Rock me momma like the wind and the rain
Rock me momma like a south bound train
Hey,  momma rock me

So girl leave your boots by the bed we ain’t leavin’ this room
Till someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It’s cold in this house and I ain’t goin’ out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you’re enough to use me for good
Put your faith to the test, when I tore off your dress, in Richmond-on-high
I sobered up, and I swore off that stuff, forever this time
And the old lovers’ say, I thought it’d be me, who helped him get home
But home was a dream, one I’d never seen, ‘til you came along

and how I can always count on you

I'd run across the river just to hold you tonight

And I'm a good walk to the river
When my workin' day is over
We'll go swim our cares away
Put your toes down in the water
And a smile across your face
And tell me that you love me

That your hands have ever held

I've seen my share of trouble
And I've held my weight in shame
But I'm baptized in your name

For my lovely Lady May
Now I ain't the toughest hickory

And I fell a good long ways

I'd spent the rest of my life standing here talking
You would explain the current, as  I  just smiled
Hoping I just stay the same, and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while. Do we even  exist?
That's when  I  make the wish, to swim away with the fish
Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?

Pay attention now, I'm standing on your porch screaming out
And I wont leave until you come downstairs
So keep your head up, keep your love
keep your head up, my love
keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, keep your love
I don't blame ya dear for running like you did, all these years
I would do the same, your best believe
The highway signs say we're close, but I don't read those things anymore
I never trusted my own eyes
When we were young oh oh, we did enough
When it got cold, Ooh ooh we bundled up
I can't be told, Ah ah, can't be done
So keep your head up, keep your love
keep your head up, my love
keep your head up, my love
Keep your head up, keep your love
Head  up,   love
Head  up,   love
Head  up,   love
Head  up,   love

13,Travelin Soldier,Aaron Lewis,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/aaron-lewis/travelin-soldier-chords-2589414," Two days past eighteen
He was waitin' for the bus in his army green
Sat down in a booth, in a cafe there
He gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair
He's a little shy so she give him a smile
And he said would you mind sittin' down for a while
And talkin' to me, I'm feelin' a little low
She said I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go
So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said I bet you got a boyfriend but I don't care
I got no one, to send a letter to
Would you mind if I sent one back here to you
 I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter said, a soldier's comin' home
So the letters came from an army camp
In California then Afghanistan
And he told her of his heart, it might be love
And all of the things that he was so scared of
He said when it's gettin' kinda rough over here
I think of that day sittin' down at the pier
And I close my eyes and see your pretty smile
Don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter said, a soldier's comin' home
One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang
A man said ""Folks, would you bow your head
To a list of local soldiers dead""
Cryin' all alone under the stands
Was a piccolo player in the marchin' band
And one name read, and nobody really cared
But the pretty little girl, with a bow in her hair
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter said, a soldier's comin'...
I cried

And they keep me going and my engine clean
Run me ragged but I don’t fret
Cause there ain’t been one slow me down none yet
Get me drinkin’ that moonshine
Get me higher than the grocery bill
Take my troubles to the high wall
Throw ‘em in the river and get your fill

Ain’t nothin’ better when the wind cuts cold
Lord it’s a mighty hard living
But a damn good feelin’ to run these roads
I got people try to tell me Red
Keep this livin’ and you’ll wind up dead
Cast your troubles on the lord of lords
Wind up layin’ on a coolin’ board
But I got buddies up at White House Road
And they keep me struttin’ when my feet hang low
Rot gut whiskey gonna ease my pain
And all this runnin’s gonna keep me sane
Get me drinkin’ that moonshine
Get me higher than the grocery bill

Won’t you sing them hymns while the banjo plays
Tell them ladies that they ought not frown
Cause there ain’t been nothing ever held me down

Same old blues, just a different day
Get me drinkin’ that moonshine
Get me higher than the grocery bill

And I'd run that thing on high hopes
'Til they raised the price of dreams so high I couldn't pay

bitchin' and moaning on and on about the time I had
and by Tuesday you could say that girl was good as gone
then when Thursday came around I was all alone
so I went for a drive to clear my mind and ended up at a shell on I-65
Then I won 100 bucks on a scratch off ticket
bought two 12 packs and a tank of gas with it
she swore they were a waste of time aww but she was wrong
I was caller #5 on the radio station
won a 4 day 3 night beach vacation
deep sea senorita fishin' down in panama
I ain't gotta see my ex-future mother in law anymore
oohh lord when it rains it pours
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
when she heard about my new found luck on the FM dial
and its crazy how lately now it just seems to come in waves
what I thought was gonna be the death of me was my saving grace
its got me thinking that her leavin' is the only logical reason
that I got the last spot in the hooters parking lot
and the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
she picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
and I only spent 5 bucks at the moose club raffle
won a used four-wheeler and 3 free passes
for me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
I ain't gotta see my ex-future mother in law anymore
oh lord when it rains it pours

Cause I got something to admit
I met a man out in the sticks
Of good Ole Miss
He drove a series 10 Cadillac
and wore cigar on his lip
Don't you know the Devil wears a suit and tie
I saw him driving down the sixty one in early July
White as a cotton field
and sharp as a knife
I heard him howlin' as he passed me by
And he said
I know you, I know you, young man
I know you by the state of your hands
You're a six string picker
Just as I... I am
Let me learn ya some, I know a few turns to make all the girls dance
Don't you know the Devil wears a suit and tie
I saw him driving down the sixty one in early July
White as a cotton field
and sharp as a knife
I heard him howlin' as he passed me by
Foolish foolish was I
   Damn my foolish eyes
cause that man's lessons had a price
Oh sweet price
My sweet soul
Everlasting
My very own
Eternal light

 Without falling out of my chair

To be blinded by the light
To feel lonely in the night
And it's blowing in the breeze babe

And rust in my mind
I'll be home come next spring
Won't you say you love me later

 Spent the most of it tongue-tied
 Pulling my belt tight
 It's just me and the stars tonight
 Two fingers and a tide line
 Keep my head head above the alpine
 Just wish I'd spent more time

Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer

Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house

And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove

What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
Sometimes we're oil and water, but I wouldn't have it any other way
And if I'm being honest, your first and my last name
Would just sound better together and probably always will

There's a gold, dirt road to a whole lot of nothin'
Got a deed to the land but it ain't my ground
This is God's country
We pray for rain, thank him when it's fallin'
'Cause it brings a grain and a little bit of money
We put it back in the plate I guess that's why
They call it God's country
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in the 40 on a muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine
With the dogs running
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country
We turned the dirt and worked until the week's done
We take a break and break bread on Sunday
And then do it all again 'cause we're proud to be
From God's country (Yeah, yeah)
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in the 40 on a muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine
With the dogs running
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (yeah)
I don't care what my headstone reads
And what kind of pine wood box I end up in
When it's my time, lay me six feet deep
In God's country (Yeah, yeah)
I saw the light in the sunrise
Sittin' back in the 40 on a muddy riverside
Gettin' baptized in holy water and 'shine
With the dogs running
Saved by the sound of the been found
Dixie whistled in the wind, that'll get you Heaven bound
The devil went down to Georgia but he didn't stick around
This is God's country (God's country)

And you don't know her like I do
We took the fire escape to her room
And got stoned, ragin' blind
Left my money in the trustin' hands
Of them ol' steel brothers and 'fastgrass' band
One day I'm gonna drive up there and give them half my mind
I don't know if it's the wine or the coke
That makes her sound like her jaw is broke
She's workin hard to make some sense, but she ain't got a dime
I wish to god that I could help her out
I wish I knew what she was talkin' 'bout
I wish to god that I could get away
but I'm way too drunk to drive
   All I know is that when I am good and sober
I am leaving West Virginia for a while
   don't know why, but every time I cross that river
Lord, there's somethin' tears me up, Makes me wild
Charleston girl with raven hair,
bloodshot eyes and skin so fair
I believe if I could find my keys, I'd try to drive away
I never planned to leave so soon
I didn't know that he was sweet on you
Go ahead and take her
'Cause she ain't worth the time
   All I know is that when I am good and sober
I am leaving West Virginia for a while
   Don't know why but every time I cross that river

  Got talked into goin' out with hopes you were stayin' in
  I was feeling like myself for the first time, in a long time.
  'Till I bumped into some of your friends, over there talkin' to mine.
  Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind, baby without warning
  I was doin' alright but just your sight had my heart stormin'
The moon went hiding, stars quit shining,
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came,
and hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
  Knew it was gonna be a long night, from the moment when,
  We locked eyes over whiskey and ice, started talkin' 'bout us again.
  If I woulda just laid my drink down,     and walked out,
  I wouldn't be in my truck, driving us to your house.
  But you rolled in with your hair in the wind, baby without warning
  I was doin' alright but just your sight had my heart stormin'
The moon went hiding, stars quit shining,
Rain was driving, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came,
and hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
You hit me category five with your smile, blew me away,
and girl it ain't but midnight, you done kill the lights,
bent my heart back to your bedside.  
  Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind, baby without warning
  I was doin' alright but just your sight had my heart stormin'

From the edge of a place I've never been
And I wanna make love hard
Under the stars in the back of a beat up ole' K-10
And I wanna love a girl who
Doesn't worry about the pictures when we kiss
Wake up one day and not be so hit and miss
Lay in bed all day and call that shit pure bliss
I'm movin' at god speed
Only God and my mama know what I need
And I feel the hardwood floors on my knees
As I beg you just to take it easy on me
I'm movin' at god speed
Well I wanna see the road melt
Into the mountains away as I drive
And make it out of this damn town alive
And not let the dreams I shoulder die
Cause I'm movin' at god speed
Only god and my mama know what I need
And I feel the hardwood floors on my knees
As I beg you just to take it easy on me
Well I wanna die an old man
Messed-up stories of me and all my old friends
And laugh about how we all thought it won't end
How we all wind up where we begin
Movin' at god speed
Where only god and our mamas know what we need
And we feel the hardwood floors on our knees
As we beg the world to bring us to our feet
Cause I'm movin at god speed
Only god and my mama know what I need
And I feel the hardwood floors on my knees
As I beg you just to take it easy on me

Haven't ate in three
Methamphetamine has got a damn good hold of me
My tweaker friends have got me to the point of no return
I just took my lighter to the bulb and watched it burn
This life of sin, (life of sin) it's got me in (got me in)
Lord it's got me back in prison once again
I used my only phone call to contact my daddy
I got twenty long years for some dust in a baggie
Well, if I would have listened to what
Mom and Papa said
I wouldn't be locked up in prison troubled in the head
Lord I took that little pop and suck until my mind was spun
I got twenty years to sit and think of what I've done
This life of sin, (life of sin) it's got me in (got me in)

Where my little life went wrong
These old jailhouse blues have got me singing this old song
Well my life is a disaster
and I feel so ashamed
In here where they call me by a number not a name
This life of sin, (life of sin) it's got me in (got me in)

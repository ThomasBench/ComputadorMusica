And said, ""Dust is all I know""
And you're so clean and I'm so tired
Like lovers' smiles and green marker miles
Can't go back that's much too far
I'm asking you to laugh
But after all
You love a tragedy
Hope remains a sidewalk stars
Could you stay right where you are
You're so smooth, and I'm on fire
Holding on, just watching it unwind
Can't go back that's much too far
I'm asking you to laugh
But after all
You love a tragedy
Can't go back that's much too far
I'm asking you to laugh
But after all
You love a tragedy

The ragged and the bones
Strewn around the room
I recall
Another hazy may
Take a round in the ring
Gone hungry for the win...
And I cracked a spark just to hear you sing...sing
Sing...
I took it out
The papers and the trash
Old among the cans
This golden love gone bad
Shined it up
Aiming at the Sun
Just a light year from us
Hop a cab ride and we’re off...
The simple notes you sang just went astray
Astray...

I knew it, listen to the song they sing.
I knew I was wrong, and I knew I was wrong.
And if I could gather up the damage
That I've rendered in my life,
Place it on a scale and weigh against
The damage done that night.
Then it'd be safe to say
The weight of all I did and didn't do
Would surly float against the lightest wrong
I ever did to you.

18,Americas Favorite Pastime,Todd Snider,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/todd-snider/americas-favorite-pastime-chords-3129314,"Dock Ellis didn't think he was pitching that day
Back in 1970
When he and his wife took a trip to the ballpark
A little bit differently
So by the time that he hit the bullpen
Half the world had melted away
That's about the time coach Murtaugh came and said
Doc, you're pitching today
Taking the mound, the ground turned into
The icing on a birthday cake
That lead off man came up and turned into
A dancing rattlesnake
The crowd tracked back and forth
In waves of color underneath the sun
That ball turned into a silver bullet
His arm into a gun
I took a look all around the world one time
I finally discovered
You can't judge a book  (Solo)
Three up, three down for three straight innings
In a zero-zero tie
As all those batters names come ringing
From a voice out of the sky
Hallucinating Halloween scenes
Each new swing of the bat
His sinker looked like it was falling off a table
But nobody was hallucinating that
I took a look all around the world one time
I finally discovered
You can't judge a book  (Solo)
By the top of the seventh, he was up one-to-nothing
And giving them Padres fits
By the bottom of the eighth, he was up two-to-nothing
And they still hadn't got any hits
With one out left to go in the game
The batter looked like a baby child
That birthday cake was shaking
Them waves of color was going wild
By the time that he mowed the last man down
He was high as he had ever been
Laughing to the sounds of the world going around
Completely unaware of the win
And while the papers would say he was scattered that day
He was pretty as a pitcher could be
The day Dock Ellis of the Pittsburgh Pirates
Threw a no hitter on LSD
I took a look all around the world one time
I finally discovered
You can't judge a book  (Solo)

Sixth gear with nowhere to steer when enough is enough,
It's guitars, tiki bars, and a whole lotta love.

She said as it came pouring down
It feels like kisses on my skin
She spread her arms and spun around
In a summer island storm
In a field of sugarcane
She taught me how and showed me why
There's something sexy about the rain
And sometimes it rained all night
And everything she did was perfect
And every way we were was right
We loved like there was no tomorrow
Then suddenly tomorrow came
And it was raining at the airport
And kept on raining on the plane
She only loved me for a season
But my heart won't ever be the same
Even now her love's the reason
There's something sexy about the rain
And sometimes when it's pouring down
I feel her kisses on my skin
I spread my arms and spin around
And let that summer island storm
Hit me like a hurricane
It's like she's right here whispering
There's something sexy about the rain
She followed me back to the city
In a picture in my mind
She's still young and she's still pretty
And even after all this time
There's something sexy about the rain
She said as it came pouring down
It feels like kisses on my skin
She spread her arms and spun around

In a field, in a field of sugarcane

With the blues, the booze and barbeques and our name on the marquee
And you should have seen, the crowd we drew in there
What I really mean, I wish you were here
I’m sending you this postcard to tell you that I’m fine
To let you know where I go, you never leave my mind
We broke down in Kentucky, in Richmond there was snow
Saw our friends in Charlotte, we played on the radio
And you should have seen us singin’ on the air
What I really mean, I wish you were here
I’m sending you this postcard to tell you that I’m fine
To let you know where I go, you never leave my mind
Tonight we’re in the city, it’s like Disneyland
But I’m sick and tired and I can’t wait to get back home again
And I had this dream, you'll be waitin’ there
What I really mean, I wish you were here
What I really mean, I wish you were here

47,Ride,Robert Earl Keen,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/robert-earl-keen/ride-chords-1057403,"One day after twenty five years
Head of service at the local Sears
Helen Walker put her pencil down and walked away
And all they found was a little note
adios was all she wrote
But as she left someone heard her say
Gonna buy me a ticket to the end of the line
Wanna feel the air and breathe the countryside
Long as those wheels keep-a-rollin
I'll be satisfied, gonna ride, ride, ride.

 want me back let me make my self clear if I leave here

49,What Kinda Gone (ver 3),Chris Cagle,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/chris-cagle/what-kinda-gone-chords-989610,"I heard the door slam but I couldn't tell
Was it just the wind or was she mad again?
Ah,   hell,  she's gettin' in her car
I hollered “Baby, is somethin' wrong?”
Thought I heard her say somethin'
Sounded like “I'm gone.”
But these days gone can mean so many things
Well, there's gone for good and good and gone
Then there's     gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
There’s gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dog-gone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple beers?
I mean what kinda gone are we talkin' 'bout here?
Well, it's gettin' dark out she ain't back yet
Ain't called home turned off the phone
Ah,   man, heh  this might not be good
I would’ve stopped her when she went to leave
But I didn't 'cause I didn't think what I'm thinkin' now
I’m still not sure what gone is all about
'Cause there's gone for good and there's good and gone
Then there's    gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
There’s gone for the day and gone for the night
   And gone for the rest of your dog-gone   life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple beers?
I mean what kinda gone are we talkin' 'bout here?
Is it the kinda gone where she's at her moms'
Coolin' down, she'll come around?
Or the kind that says you had your chance
She ain't comin' back?
Well, there's gone for good and there's good and gone
Then there's   gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
There’s gone for the day and gone for the night
   And gone for the rest of your dog-gone   life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple beers?
I mean what kinda gone are we talkin' 'bout?
What kinda gone are we talkin’ ‘bout?
What kinda gone are we talkin''bout here?
What kinda gone?

0,Honky Tonk Hearts,John Anderson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-anderson/honky-tonk-hearts-chords-1807154,"I see across the dance floor and you're somethin' to see
I smile at you and I say ""Will you dance with me""
I hold you in the shadows and while the feelin' grows
Something seems to tell me we've both felt this before
Honky tonk hearts fall in love easy
And it's so easy when you hold each other tight
Honky tonk hearts, believing forever
But it always looks different in the bright morning light
Honky tonk hearts fall in love easy
And it's so easy when you hold each other tight
Honky tonk hearts, believing forever
But it always looks different in the bright morning light
Honky tonk hearts fall in love easy
And it's so easy when you hold each other tight
Honky tonk hearts, believing forever
But it always looks different in the bright morning light

1,Disappearing Farmer,John Anderson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-anderson/disappearing-farmer-chords-1806600,"I remember Grandpa standing over by the gate 
His eyes turned up to heaven, wondering why the rain was late
And it seems so sad to look back now   and see him lying there
In a $500 casket with the dirt still in his hand
It's a sad truth when the wind can blow a man's whole away
Like to strip the topsoil from the ground where the corn grew yesterday
Makes him a disappearing farmer cause his dreams rode with that wind
And all he knows is dominoes and some close, old wrinkled friends
Grandpa saw it comin', of that there ain't no doubt
With the bankers on his doorstep and a cotton killin' drought
But he was a kind and and he was a gentle man, until the bitter end
And he was smiling on his deathbed, glad he hadn't sold out to them
Now a modern 2 lane blacktop runs across the old homeplace
And the man that ran the graveyard didn't recognize my face
And the ground beneath seems drier now, my God, when will it rain
And pushing pretty flowers around my grandpa's grave
It's a sad truth when the wind can blow a man's whole away
Like to strip the topsoil from the ground where the corn grew yesterday
Makes him a disappearing farmer cause his dreams rode with that wind
And all he knows is dominoes and some close, old wrinkled friends
It's a sad truth when the wind can blow a man's whole away
Like to strip the topsoil from the ground where the corn grew yesterday
Makes him a disappearing farmer cause his dreams rode with that wind
And all he knows is dominoes and some close, old wrinkled friends

  I’ve lost my respect

  I stay just one step ahead of a welfare dollar bill

  I was headed right to the top, honey, all I needed was time
  But you put some lovin’ on me,  it was so unreal
  Goin' down hill,    I'm goin' down hill
And still I can’t get my fill of you
  I can’t eat, I can’t sleep, I think about you
  From daylight to dawn
  I bet I won’t weigh 15 pounds 
  a-when they drag my body home
 And like a junkie hooked on dope, I’m   hooked on your thrill

I let her slip away, I could have called her today 
For the price of a thin silver dime

If I could just go back in time
I'd let her know my love was still burning
And once more I'd try to make her mine
If I had a million, I'd spend it all 
To buy back her love one more time

If I had a million, I'd spend it all 
To buy back her love one more time

The painter's hands are trembling now
And if she's out there running wild
It's just because I taught her how
The masterpiece that we had planned
Is laying shattered on the ground
Mona Lisa lost her smile
And the painter's hands are trembling now
Now they no longer look my way
And the love that used to be
Why, it just got lost in yesterday
Well there used to burn a flame
I gave too little, took too much
'Til I erased the painter's name

He went thumbin' and sleepin' on the roadside livin' in jeans
Along about Pittsburgh he got him a good job
Bought him a brand new Malibu Chevy that was part of his dreams

Shot a little nine ball bet a little money on the football games

They locked him up and they traded him a number for his name

31,The Greatest Love Affair,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/the-greatest-love-affair-chords-3999541," I dreamed I woke up and you were gone
 I reached out,  but no one was there
   I called your name  and nobody answered
 And I wondered : ""if I cry,  would you care ?""
        I had said I love you so many times
 But they're just words that you hear people say
 And I never knew just how much I loved you
Until suddenly,   you'd gone away
 Now who'd stand by me the way you did
When I was weak  it was you  that made me strong
 And you had a way of touching my heart
Like the words  in a beautiful song
 Oh we had good times and   we shared the bad
 So I'll take whatever comes
Cause you were the best years of my life
And we shared the cake   and we shared the crumbs
      Then just before the hurt had built up in my heart
To a mountain  that I knew I could never climb
I woke up, I woke up to a beautiful world,  and you were there
 You were there all the time
I love you America, I love you America
 And if I sail  a stormy sea
 Please be there to shelter me
I love you America, I love you America
 So just keep holdin' me close  and I will care
And we'll show the world  that what we share
Is still the greatest  love affair
   And I love you   America
 I love you

And among the carburetors and the re-built generators
I spent the whole night picking on an old flattop guitar
John would play the fiddle and I'd always sing a little
No there is no place to get filled up the way you could at John's
John taught me a whole lot about country music because he loved it
We'd sit up and listen to the Grand Ole Opry every Saturday night
And I was awfully young back then, but still I knew just why
When we heard that Hank had died
He had a way of making us kids feel important
Simply by giving us a good clean place to hang out
Well I can still hear him saying pumping gas is a fever boys
It'll get in your blood and it'll make your face break out in a grin
Just to check old lady Hanson's oil or to help a stranded friend
And among the carburetors and the re-built generators
I spent the whole night picking on an old flattop guitar
John would play the fiddle and I'd always sing a little
No there is no place to get filled up the way you could at John's
And among the carburetors and the re-built generators
I spent the whole night picking on an old flattop guitar
John would play the fiddle and I'd always sing a little
No there is no place to get filled up the way you could at John's

Will leave you stranded on life's shore
One good friend who truly loves you
Is worth the pain your heart endures
We never know which way the wind will blow
Nor when or where the next turmoil will be
But He's a solid rock when troubles grow
And He's holding out a saving hand for me
Fair-weather friends fair-weather sailors
Will leave you stranded on life's shore
One good friend who truly loves you
Is worth the pain your heart endures
He'll be a refuge in the storm
He'll be a beacon in the night
In the chilly winds of doubt He'll keep you warm
When you can't find your way He'll be your light
Fair-weather friends fair-weather sailors
Will leave you stranded on life's shore
One good friend who truly loves you
Is worth the pain your heart endures

Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
To a backwards old town I often remembered
So many times that my memories are worn
Than, sometimes we'd travel on down the Green River
To the abandoned old prison down by Adrian Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
But empty pop bottles was all that we?d kill
Daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the green river where paradise lay?""
I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away""
Well the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
They stripped all the timber and tortured the land
They dug for the coal till the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man
Daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the green river where paradise lay?""
I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away""
When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester Dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with paradise waitin'
Five miles away from wherever I am
Daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
Down by the green river where paradise lay?""
I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away""

You may dream a dream that's twice your size 
All night through when the morning comes 
Who's to tell your dreams to only you
Only love love only only love will do   
Only love love only only love comes true  
Nothing else you see there's nothing else 
Only love only love
But when the morning comes and who?s to tell You?ll dreams to only you
I have known a love within my heart one or two 
Where one love would end and then one would start I never knew  
If love should come your way you'd learn to say 
I love you I love you

Put a slouch hat down low on the ears
I'm yearning to leave this old town on the flight
And lose all my troubles and cares
In this day of airplanes and highways
Hey the slow way is sometimes the best
I'm longin? to ride on a freight train
And be a good old american guest
I wanna live on the land that I've loved and I've labored for
And spend a few days headed west
I'm longin? to ride on a freight train
And be a good old american guest
Well, the pressures of life they got to me
And they got down deep in my soul
I'm tired of the rat-race wanna go back to the slow pace
And hear a fast train rattle and roll
I wanna live on the land that I've loved and I've labored for
And spend a few days headed west
I'm longin? to ride on a freight train
And be a good old american guest
I wanna live on the land that I've loved and I've labored for
And spend a few days headed west
I'm longin? to ride on a freight train
And be a good old american guest
Oh, yes I'm longing to ride on a freight train
And be a good old american guest,

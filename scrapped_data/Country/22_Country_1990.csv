Take your hat off
When you walk inside

  And, me, I'd come to push and shove - so, I pulled up a chair
We talked of roads untraveled we talked of love untrue
Of strings that come unraveled we were kings and kindred fools
And just when I'd hit bottom - that old man raised his glass
And said, at least we had our chances there's those who never have
So, here's to all the soldiers who have ever died in vain
The insane locked up in themselves the homeless down on Main
To those who stand on empty shores and spit against the wind
And those who wait forever For Ships That Don't Come In
He said its only life's illusions that bring us to this bar
To pick up these old crutches and compare each other’s scars
'Cuz the things we're calling heartaches - hell, they're hardly worth our time
  We bitch about a dollar - when there's those without a dime
And as he ordered one last round he said I guess we can’t complain
God made life a gamble and we're still in the game
So,  here's to all the soldiers who have ever died in vain
The insane locked up in themselves the homeless down on Main
To those who stand on empty shores and spit against the wind
And those who wait forever For Ships That Don't Come In

But there's a warm wind blowing the stars are out

We've both played this game before.
Say I love you, Say goodbye

Of ever leaving southern Arizona, or ever hearing wedding bells ring
He never had alot luck with the ladies, but he sure had alot of good working skills
Never cared about climbing any ladder, He knew the way in a small cafe; found the will
He met Miss Bonnie and a little bit of her was a little too much
A few movies and a few months later,  the feeling got strong enough
He didn't own a car so it must of been   love.......
I drove him uptown for a diamond  that's when he started goin'
Over the line, workin' overtime
To give her things just to hear her say she don't deserve them
But he loved her and he just kept goin' overboard
Over the limit to afford, to give her things he knew she wanted
'Cause without her   where would he be, see it's not for him
She is his only need
Ring on her finger and one on the ladder, A new promotion every now and then
Bonnie worked until she couldn't tie her apron, then stayed at home and had the first of 
And my, how the time did fly, The babies grew up and moved away
Left 'em sitting on the front porch rocking, Billy watching Bonnie's hair turn gray
And every once in a-while you could see him get up and he'd head downtown
'Cause heard about something she wanted,  and it just had to be found
Didn't matter how simple or how much, it was love........
And boy ain't that love just something, when it's strong enough to keep a man goin’
Over the line, workin' overtime
To give her things just to hear her say she don't deserve them
But he loved her and he just kept goin' overboard
Over the limit to afford, to give her things he knew she wanted
'Cause without her where would he be, see it's not for him

And take her without a fight.

In the eyes of our home town.

She would never look at someone else.

I've crawled beside them in the mines and touched the walls of hell
I've shared their sacred secrets, known their triumph and their pain
And right or wrong I'll stand with them on the final judgment day
They say God gives his comfort when the time of trouble comes
They say we'll own no share of peace till we lay down our guns
But will my boy have the chance to do the things I've never done
Or will he, like me, be told that he must be his father's son?

Where North Carolina comes close to the stars
There's livin' a lady she's shinin' so high
They call her the ""Carolina Star""
She works at the factory from Monday through Friday
She's raisin' three daughters alone
Their daddy's away, he's chasing a dream
They're waitin' for the day that he comes home
Oh, Carolina
Even stars get lonesome now and then
Oh, Carolina
Don't you worry, he'll be comin' home again
He's playin' his songs stand in Nashville
He's pickin' for tips in a bar
He's broke and all alone, but he ain't ready to come home
Where he wants to be a bluegrass pickin' star
Oh, Carolina
Even stars get lonesome now and then
Oh, Carolina
Don't you worry, he'll be comin' home again
Sometimes she wakes up just thinking of him
She remembers him beside her in the night
While out across those hills that old moon is settled in
And those Carolina stars are shining bright
Oh, Carolina
Even stars get lonesome now and then
Oh, Carolina
Don't you worry, he'll be comin' home again
Yes he loves you and he's comin' home again.

I've come to talk to you tonight About the things I've seen you do
I've come to set the record straight  I've come to shine the light on you
Let me introduce myself, I'm the cold hard truth
There's a woman we both know  I think you know the one I mean
She gave her heart and soul to you  You gave her only broken dreams
You say you're not the one to blame  For all the heartache she's been through
I say you're nothing but a liar  And I'm the cold hard truth
All your life that's how it's been  Looking out for number one
Taking more than you give  Movin' on when you're done
With her you could have it all  A family enough to last
If you had any sense at all  You'd go and beg her to come back       (key change)
You think that you're a real man But you're nothing but a fool
The way you run away from love The way you try to play it cool
I'm gonna say this just one time  Time is running out on you
You best remember me my friend  I'm the cold hard truth
You best remember my my friend   I am the cold hard truth

And knowing that you'llbe waiting at the end of the day
So hurry sundown, Hurry sundown
When shadows fall we leave it all behind
Hurry sundown, Hurry sundown
Cause the day's been rough but when we make love
Everything's gonna be alright
It must be hard on you, you got so much to do
I know sometimes the day seems so long
But from dusk till dawn, we're in each other's arms
And the love we share keeps usholding on

Can you summon honey from a telephone?
They sat there with their hooks in the water
and their moustaches caked with airplane glue.
O come let us adore them, California overboard
When the sun sets on the ghetto all the broken stuff gets cold.
Smith and Jones, forever!
Smith and Jones, forever!
Smith and Jones, forever, together, forever and ever. Together, forever and ever.
Build a stage, for Autumn's bitch.
They walk the alleys in duct tape shoes.
They see the things they need through the windows of a hatchback
The alleys are the footnotes of the avenues.
O come let us adore them, California overboard
holding up their trousers with extension cords.
Smith and Jones, forever!
Smith and Jones, forever!
Smith and Jones, forever, together, forever and ever. Together, forever and ever.
I've got two tickets to a midnight execution.
We'll hitchhike our way from Odessa to Houston
and when they turn on the chair, something’s added to the air

To the air, forever

I don't want to be standing here with this ticket for this outbound plane
Cause I've been here before and somehow it doesn't feel the same.
But talk is cheap and we could talk all night long and we may
Never figure out just where our love went wrong.
And I don't want to be standing here and I don't want to be talking here
And I don't really care who's to blame
Cause if love won't fly on it's own free will
It's going to catch that outbound plane.
The old folks say that love's not forever anymore
Because these young people walk away from love, alone to pace the floor.
Young or old I say that love is still the same
And you may walk away from love but you won't fall over heels again.
Two lonely hearts in this airport knowing,
Neither one cares where the other heart is going
But if love won't fly on it's own free will
it's going to catch that outbound plane.
That frown you're wearing's just your halo turned upside down.
Where's the laughter we once shared back in the lost and found?
These broken wings are going to leave me here to stand my ground
And you can have this ticket, that lonely plane is flying out.

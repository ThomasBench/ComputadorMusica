  Take me there.
Things nobody knows, not even your friends.                      
   Take me there.
Tell me about your momma, your daddy, your home town, show me around.
 I wanna see it all, don't leave anything out.
I wanna know, everything about you.                                
And I wanna go, down every road you've been.
Where your hopes and dreams and wishes live,
where you keep the rest of your life hid.
I wanna know the girl behind that pretty stare.    
Take me there.
Your first real kiss,    your first ture love,
   you were scared. Show me where.
You learned about life, spent your summer nights, without a care.
I wanna roll down mainstreet and backroads
like you did when you were a kid.
 What makes you who you are, tell me what your story is.
I wanna know, everything about you.                                
And I wanna go, down every road you've been.
Where your hopes and dreams and wishes live,
where you keep the rest of your life hid.
I wanna know the girl behind that pretty stare.     
Take me there.
I wanna know,         everything about you.
And I wanna go, down every road you've been.
Where your hopes and dreams and wishes live,
where you keep the rest of your life hid.
I wanna know the girl behind that pretty stare.
Take me there, etc...

Will always stand up and salute, will always recognize.
When we see ol' glory flyin', there's a lot of men dead.
So we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head.
My daddy served in the army, where he lost his right eye,
But he flew a flag out in our yard till the day that he died.
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister and me,
To grow up and live happy on the land of the free.
Now this nation that I love has fallen under attack,
A mighty sucker punch came flyin' in from somewhere in the back.
Soon as we could see clearly, through our big black eye.
Man we lit up your world like the 4th of July.
Hey Uncle Sam, put your name at the top of his list
And the statue of liberty started shakin' her fist
And the eagle will fly, there's gonna be hell
When you hear mother freedom start ringin' her bell
And it feels like the whole wide world is rainin' down on you.
Brought to you courtesy, of the red, white and blue.

This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage
You'll be sorry that you messed with, the u..s....of a..a...a..a

At that quiet little corner spot
Where we used to hang with all our friends
And I'll ease down to the local pub
Climb up on the tallest stool
Holding court with my common sense
Outwitting all these common fools
I've got good taste for blended whiskey
I can see my way around this bar
I can hear the sound of a vintage jukebox
And smell the smoke of a hand-rolled cigar
I can't read your mind
Baby I can sense this much
When it comes to your love
I feel like I'm losing my touch
You're not buying this anymore
My lies have come up short again
You haven't said it's over yet
Oh but I can feel a bitter wind
And after giving me your better years
And hoping for the very best
Closing time is drawing near 
As I sit alone with all the rest

To see her husband's family
And on the way upon her hip
Was laid my head down gently
All due respect was meant and all
The winds were in agreement
That this was answering the call
Of awkward and true feeling
A fireman her husband was
And so to give him duty
I duly tried to light a fire
Upon his rightful booty
But beauty was my treasure then
As through the hills I drove her
And taught her that another man
Could have made love to her
Doo doo do do do doo
Doo doo do do do doo
Doo doo do do do doo
Strange is good if it is kept
A secret with the ""lovers""
Who love their mates and love themselves
And need the love of others
Through the window I could see
The fields and clouds all passing
As in the passenger position
Eleanor was thrashing
I stopped the car we got a beer
And then eased down the road
A little guilt, and some guilt spilt
And added to our load
Doo doo do do do doo
Doo doo do do do doo
Doo doo do do do doo

And I can sleep beneath the piano
Just like that's my natural home
With all those keys I never feel alone
Just like that's my natural home
With all those keys I never feel alone
I met a girl in a sleepy town down by the sea
She swore she didn't want nothing from me
Now if you ever hear that line boy don't you dare believe
There ain't nothing but deep blues down in that bitter recipe
And when I left town she had those tears in her eyes
But,  I ain't one for no emotional goodbyes
So she swam into that bottle like a fish back to its home
Couple more drinks and you don't know she's alone
Yeah she swam into that bottle like a fish back to the sea
Couple more drinks and she forgot all about me
Met a lot of guys a lot tougher than me
It's like it ain't no kinda competition indeed
They say ""hey boy have you ever been stabbed before""
I said ""not yet, I'm grabbin' my hat and just heading for the door""
I made my way down to that rich side of town
Where everybody's tossin' big words around
But as soon as I turn my back to head downtown
I hear those whispers like rain just fallin' on down
Say he drink like a fish and he goin' fly like a stone
Boy is better off left alone

I turn it all over, plow it all under
Plant em in the spingtime, n' pick em in the summer

No rain just a sunshine, out here in my own mind
I live where I can breathe, ain't nothin but a cool breeze
Nobody that it won't please, out here where ya can breathe
Randy and Danny Ray, the'll show back up any day
That's one thing you can count on, but sometimes the'll be long gone
I'd rather be hunt'n, hooked on fish'n
Read on their t-shirts, if you don't believe it
Hardwood floor creak'n, bedroom door squeak'n
She's standing in the kitchen, I thought she was still sleep'n
Kiss her on the forehead, ask her how she slept 
She say's honey it early, we proably shouldn't speak yet

   A town becomes a mark on the soul

   Weaving the reeds to cover our child

Memories of you undressing
And your lips my final blessing

The embrace that I'd been lacking
Has been found with kisses smacking
And two bodies there attacking
I and you
Baby why don't we feel guilty
Why's it seem we're doing right
When we're doing something filthy
In a rented room tonight
I think it's cuz we love the now
We love forever love, and how

And your life's my love, everyday

 Come a little closer baby
I feel like strippin' it down
 Bback to the basics of you and me
And what makes the world go round
  Every inch of you against my skin
  I wanna be stronger than we've ever been
 So come a little closer baby
I feel like strippin' it down
 Come a little bit closer baby
 Just a little bit closer baby
 Come a little bit closer baby
I feel like layin' you down

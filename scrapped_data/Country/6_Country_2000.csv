Wherever you go
Wherever you land
I’ll do what I can
Impossible Germany
Unlikely Japan
The fundamental problem
We all need to face
This is important
But I know you’re not listening
Oh I know you’re not listening
I wouldn’t understand
Impossible Germany 
Unlikely Japan
This is what love is for
To be out of place
Gorgeous and alone
Face to face
That need to be erased
Nothing more important 
Than to know someone’s listening
Now I know you’ll be listening

  Mm mm mm, mm mm mm mmm mmm
Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around
   And we know it's never simple, never easy
   Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know, like the back of my hand
   Breathe   without you, but I have to
   Breathe   without you, but I have to
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I try to swerve
People are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

You're the only thing I know, like the back of my hand

Pulled up beside me talkin' on his cell phone
He started yelling at me like I did something wrong
He flipped me the bird an' then he was gone
Some beach
Somewhere
There's a big umbrella casting shade over an empty chair
Palm trees are growin' and a warm breezes a blowing
I picture myself right there
On Some beach, somewhere
I circled the parkin' lot, trying to find a spot
Just big enough I could park my old truck
A man with a big cigar was getting into his car
I stopped and I waited for him to back up
From out of no where a Mercedes Benz
Came cruisin' up and whipped right in
Some beach
Somewhere
There's nowhere to go when you got all day to get there
There's cold margaritas and hot Senoritas smiling with long dark hair
On some beach
Somewhere
Some beach
Somewhere
There's a beautiful sunset burning up the atmosphere
There's music and dancing and lovers romancing
In the salty evening air
On some beach

And I jumped off the interstate to Highway 8;
To the bars full of girls who all know me by name.

You will never leave Harlan alive

And he asked Tillie Helton to be his bride
Said, won't you walk with me out of the mouth of this holler
Or we'll never leave Harlan alive
Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinkin'
And you spend your life just thinkin' of how to get away

'Til a man from the Northeast arrived
Waving hundred dollar bills said, I'll pay you for your minerals
But he never left Harlan alive
Granny sold out cheap and they moved out west of Pineville
To a farm where big Richland River winds
I bet they danced them a jig, laughed and sang a new song
Who said we'd never leave Harlan alive
But the times got hard and tobacco wasn't selling
And ole granddad knew what he'd do to survive
He went and dug for Harlan coal and sent the money back to granny
But he never left Harlan alive
Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinkin'
And you spend your life just thinkin' of how to get away
Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you're drinkin'
And you spend your life digging coal from the bottom of your grave

This is where the cream is gonna rise
This is what you really didn't know
This is where the truth don't lie

Wants to shake your hand

   But, let one of those rocks give way
Then you slide back down
Look up and see who's around then
This ain't where the road comes to an end
This ain't where the bandwagon stops
This is just one of those times when
A lot of folks jump off

So much for ditching this town and hanging out on the coast
Oh well, those plans are long gone, and he said
There goes my life
There goes my future, my everything
Might as well kiss it all goodbye
There goes my life

That mistake he thought he made covers up the refrigerator
Oh yeah, he loves that little girl
Mama's waiting to tuck her in as she fumbles up those stairs
She smiles back at him dragging that teddy bear
Sleep tight, blue eyes and bouncing curls, and he smiles

There goes my future, my everything

And 15 pairs of shoes and his American Express

To make you jealous of me.
The room filled up with mosquitos
They heard that my body was free
And I took the dust of a long sleepless night
And I put it in your little shoe
And I must confess that I tortured the dress
That you wore for the world to look through.
And I showed my heart to the doctor
He said, “You just have to quit”
Then he wrote himself a prescription
And your name was mentioned in it
Then he locked himself in a library shelf
With the details of our honeymoon
And I hear from the nurse that he’s gotten much worse
And his practice is all in a ruin.
I once knew a saint who had loved you
I studied all night in his school
He taught that the duty of lovers 
Was to tarnish the golden rule.
And just when I was sure that his teachings were pure
He drowned himself in the pool
His body is gone, but out here on the lawn
His spirit continues to drool.
An Eskimo showed me a movie
He’d recently taken of you
The poor man could hardly stop shivering
His lips and his fingers were blue
I suppose that he froze when the wind took your clothes
And I guess he just never got warm
But you stand there so nice, in your blizzard of ice
Please let me come into your storm.

I've heard you wake up crying from the evils lying under our bed
You say there's no use trying to protect you from the danger and dread
Though this world is made of fearsome beasts that bark and bite
We born to put these creatures through one hell of a fight
May we feast upon the flesh of any fever that befalls you tonight
Sooner sides will spread wide open 
we shall feast when darkness falls
sing until our jaws are broken
'neath the black and waters cold
Lay down your burdens don't you let them drag you into the ground
I know you're hurting but there's plenty of your pain to go around
Lord knows that everybody''s got a cross to bear
Don't see no use in trying to contrast and compare
There's always someone being slaughtered by a bigger stack of splinters somewhere

Patience we can temper strong
Put our able hands to labor
We will work through what went wrong

Accidents and accusations
Messages and misperceptions
Paralyze my mind
Busses, cars, and airplanes leaving
Burning fumes of gasoline
And everyone is running

It's okay when there's nothing more to say to me
And the peaceful quiet you create for me
And the way you keep the world at bay for me
The way you keep the world at bay
Monkeys on the barricades
Are warning us to back away
They form commissions trying to find
The next one they can crucify
And anger plays on every station
Answers only make more questions
I need something to believe in
Breathe in sanctuary in the

For months I got myself in ruts 
Too much time spent in mirrors framed in yellow walls

And says I'm too caught up

And truth is cool but all that matters 
Is you have your good times
But their good times come with prices
And I can't believe it when I hear the jokes they make
At anyone's expense except their own
Would they laugh if they knew who paid?

In an older part of town
Somethin' caught my eye
And I stopped and turned around
I stepped inside an' there I spied
In the middle of it all
Was a beat up old guitar
Hangin' on the wall.
""What do you want for that piece of junk?""
I asked the old man
He just smiled and took it down
And he put it in my hand
He said, ""You tell me what it's worth
You're the one who wants it
Turn it up, play a song
And let's just see what haunts it.""
So I hit a couple of cords
In my old country way of strumming
And then my fingers turned to lightnin'
Man, I never heard it comin'
It was like I always knew it
I just don't know where I learned it
It wadn't nothin' but the truth
So I just reared back and burned it
Well, I lost all track of time
There was nothing I couldn't pick
Up and down the neck
Man.. I never missed a lick
The guitar almost played itself
There was nothing I could do
It was getting hard to tell
Just who was playing who
When I finally put it down
I couldn't catch my breath
My hands were shakin'
And I was scared to death
The old man finally got up
Said, ""where in the Hell you been?
I've been waiting all these years
For you to stumble in""
Then he took down an old dusty case
Said, ""go on and pack it up,
You don't owe me nothing""
And then he said, ""good luck""
There was somethin' spooky in his voice
And somethin' strange on his face
When he shut the lid
I saw my name was on the case

Old among the cans
This golden love gone bad
Shined it up
Aiming at the Sun
Just a light year from us
Hop a cab ride and we’re off...
And all the ravens came along to play

0,Who Didnt (ver 2),Logan Mize,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/logan-mize/who-didnt-chords-3632831,"Who didn't drive in granddaddy's lap
Skin their knee when the tire got flat
Have old wooden spoons hangin' up on the wall of the kitchen
Who didn't get their hair cut at the house
Swim in a pool that was all above ground
Have one pair of boots for work and they went to church in 'em
Work like hell, pray in the huddle
Cruise 'round a two-lane no name bubble
Put it in park for some cold beer kissin'
We didn't know anybody who didn't
Mow their own yard, fill their own tank
Check on the temp on the sign at the bank
Not everybody lived in thosе city limits
But we didn't know anybody who didn't
Yeah who didn't have a swing out on thе porch
Burn up their fingers every July 4th
Save up for a new used car with the hubcap missin'
Work like hell, pray in the huddle
Cruise 'round a two-lane no name bubble
Put it in park for some cold beer kissin'
We didn't know anybody who didn't
Mow their own yard, fill their own tank
Check on the temp on the sign at the bank
Not everybody lived in thosе city limits
But we didn't know anybody who didn't
Who didn't fall in love, grow up too fast
And try to leave and then come right back
If that ain't you then you don't know
what you're missin'
Work like hell, pray in the huddle
Cruise 'round a two-lane no name bubble
Put it in park for some cold beer kissin'

2,Grit And Grace,Balsam Range,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/balsam-range/grit-and-grace-chords-3339257,"There's holes in my heart, scars on my soul
Nights I fell apart, in days I lost control on the inside
Waiting for the storm to subside
Somehow scraping by, climbing every hill
Too stubborn not to try, I never lost the will to wonder
When I'd hear the still beyond the thunder
With one part moxy, another part mettle
I found mercy, refusing to settle for a hiding place
In sacrifice and second-guessing
Finding strength in every blessing
Through all the tears and fears I had to face
I supplied the grit, God supplied the grace
Claw, tooth and nail, through heartache and hell
Pray to prevail, and one day live to tell another story
One that had a happy ending for me
Parted with my pride, learned how to trust
In the chapters of who I grew to be ever after
With one part moxy, another part mettle
I found mercy, refusing to settle for a hiding place
In sacrifice and second-guessing
Finding strength in every blessing
Through all the tears and fears I had to face

Maria guide me by the light  of all the stars I used to know by name
And if a one man war's a cosmic joke I guess I'll have to laugh at all the pain
And so what, I spike my coffee maybe I'll never learn
And I must admit the devil on my shoulder is a master of her words
'Cause then I let you in 'cause you were crying in the hall
Fool me once again wrote your name on every wall
Now the crows are crawling, longing for the magic
The happiness you knew when you were a kid
So I'm up here strumming on the rooftop
While the black of mid-morning's flooding in
'Cause all I want is something to believe in more than nothing
and I guess that's all I'm asking from anything at all
I don't wanna be the kind who's tangled up all the time in their dreaming
And what's the point of being needed?

Like it was written in the stars
But it all comes out eventually

It's not banging of the drum
  It's not the person that you were
It's not the person you become
  It's not where you're headed to
And it's not where you're coming from

And clutch that crystal 'round her neck

Between her history and her past

Every morning in the senior parking lot
Every weekend in the fields with the windows hot
She learned to work 'em in to every every sentence
So that she made herself useful to the men who print em
All the way up in the balconies half the working class is clapping ones and threes
Sarah memorized every bumper sticker
On the back of every pickup with a rebel flag
Every morning in the senior parking lot
Every weekend in the fields with the windows hot

49,Black Lung,Steve Earle,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/steve-earle/black-lung-chords-3388511,"Sunrise lighting up the ridge tops
Slicing through the frost like a red hot knife
Sometimes I'm dreaming I'm a running across
But I couldn't now to save my life
Hound dog, yipping in the holler
Must have jumped a bear bubba brother, listen to him run
Somebody oughta catch him by the collar
But I ain't going nowhere 'cause I'm down with black lung
Black lung never gets better
Every breath a little bit harder to draw
Shotgun loaded in the corner
Reckon I'mma lay here and die of black lung
Someday's are better than the others
Sit out on the porch when it's cool at night
Can't say there ain't some suffering
Every breath I take like a twelve round fight
Grandbabies out beneath the willow tree
Hollering and laughing, and it sound like fun
Can't pick 'em up, hug 'em all, anyway
Sorry honey granddaddy's got a black lung
Black lung never gets better
Every breath a little bit harder to draw
Shotgun loaded in the corner
Reckon I'm a lie here and die of black lung
It seemed like it was only yesterday
I pulled my first shift down a longwall mine
First breath of fresh air at the whistle
And I already knew it's just a matter of time
If I'd never been down in a coal mine
I'd live a lot longer, hell that ain't a close call
But then again I'd've never had anything
And half a life is better than nothing at all
Black lung never gets better
Every breath a little bit harder to draw
Shotgun loaded in the corner
Reckon I'm a lie here and die of black lung
Black lung never gets better
Every breath a little bit harder to draw
Shotgun loaded in the corner
Reckon I'm a lie here and die of black lung
Black lung
Never gets better
Every breath a little bit harder to draw
Shotgun loaded in the corner
Reckon I'mma lay here and die of black lung

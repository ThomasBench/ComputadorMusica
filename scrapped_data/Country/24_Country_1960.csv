How come they're all living in places
With too much snow or too much sand?""
Tell your mommy, ""I got a funny feeling deep inside of me""
Ask your daddy, ""Is it really as bad as people make it seem?""
Wa ta tick it ta too too
Wa ta tick it ta too too X2
Wa ta tick it ta
Ask your mommy why everybody swallows all those little pills
Ask your daddy why doesn't that soldier care who he kills
After they've put you to sleep and tucked you safely down in your bed
Whisper, ""Mommy and Daddy would you rather that
I learned it from my friends, instead?
Do you think I'm to young to know, to see, to feel, or hear
My questions need an answer or a vacuum will appear""
Don't be surprised if they turn and walk away
And tell your mommy and daddy that you love them anyway
That you love them anyway

38,To Beat The Devil,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/to-beat-the-devil-chords-3370055,"It was winter time in Nashville, down on music row
And I was looking for a place to get myself out of the cold
To warm the frozen feeling that was eating at my soul
And keep the chilly wind off me and my guitar
Well, my thirsty wanted whisky; and my hungry needed beans
But it'd been of month of paydays since I'd heard that eagle scream
So with a stomach full of empty and a pocket full of dreams
I left my pride and stepped inside a bar
Actually, I guess you'd could call it a Tavern
Cigarette smoke to the ceiling, sawdust on the floor friendly shadows
Well, I saw that there was just one old man, that was sitting at the bar
And in the mirror I could see him checking me and my guitar
An' he turned and said: ""Come up here boy, and show us what you are
I said: ""I'm dry."" He bought me a beer
Then he nodded at my guitar and said: ""It's a tough life, ain't it?""
I just looked at him and he said: ""You ain't making any money, are you?""
I said: ""You've been reading my mail""
He just smiled and said: ""Let me see that guitar, I've got something you oughta hear""
Then he laid it on me
If you waste your time a-talking to the people who don't listen
To the things that you are saying, who do you think's going to hear
And if you should die explaining how the things that they complain about
Are things they could be changing who do you think's going to care?
There were other lonely singers in a world turned deaf and blind
Who were crucified for what they tried to show
And their voices have been scattered by the swirling winds of time
All the truth remains that no-one wants to know
Well, the old man was a stranger, but I'd heard his song before
Back when failure had me locked out on the wrong side of the door
When no-one stood behind me but my shadow on the floor
And lonesome was more than a state of mind
You see, the devil haunts a hungry man
And if you don't wanna join him,  well you gotta beat him
I ain't saying I beat the devil, but I drank his beer for nothing
   And then I stole his song
And you still can hear me singing to the people who don't listen
To the things that I am saying, praying someone's going to hear
And I guess I'll die explaining how the things that they complain about
Are things they could be changing, hoping someone's going to care
I was born a lonely singer, and I'm bound to die the same
But I've got to feed the hunger in my soul
And if I never have a nickle, I won't ever die ashamed
Cause I don't believe that no-one wants to know
             Do do do doo

With fire in his eyes burning red as sundown
His boots were all dusty, his coat open wide
Six ways of dying hung low on his side
He went in the town hall asking for me
They told him that I was still town deputy
I sent him to prison to pay for his crime
He killed a guard on the Sante Fe line
He spread word around town that my time had come
My notch was already carved on his gun
He's laughing and braggin and having his fun
It's all a show for he knows I won't run
That night in silence the town was asleep
I sat by my window and looked down the street
I wished in my heart that he would just ride away
I hated to face him next sunup that day
I met him at sunup, the crowd gathered round
Waitin and watching for one to go down
He grabbed for his six gun, tryin his best
He cursed as my bullet went deep in his chest
He stood there a moment and looked all around
Slowly and lifeless he fell to the ground
The stranger's my brother, born an outlaw
He must have forgotton I taught him to draw
The whole town was waiting and I was alone
The blood that I spilled was just like my own
When she hears this story, how Mother will cry
Brother 'gainst brother and one had to die

Skedaddled in confusion although 30, 000 strong

And leaving their poor friends behind with the yankees for assisstence

And again o'er Sumpter's battered walls the stars and stripes do fly
While the chivalry of 61, in the last ditch does lie

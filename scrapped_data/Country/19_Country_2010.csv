0,Wolf Song,Caamp,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/caamp/wolf-song-chords-2751990,"Pack the bags
This time I am heading North
Left the racks
Won’t need those where I’m going
Count the stacks
Dodging cops cause nobody here wants a bind
Toke a pack
Calling shots pretend all the while that you’re mine
And I'm always thinking of you
Always thinking I could love you more
Know I'm always thinking of you
Always thinking I could love you more
Burn it all
Burn it all fire light deep in my eyes
Break the news
Heed the call
Howling like one of our kind
These days read clearly
Like a wolf in the snow
In some way I feel you near me
And darlin’ as long as you know
That I’m always thinking of you
Always thinking I could love you more
Know I'm always thinking of you
Always thinking I could love you more
No I'm always thinking of you

Take me back,   the words I'd say
I had to whisper
Because you liked it that way

But I,           I still try
Cross my heart, now I hope to die

Warmed up the hands
And the hearts of the young
And the old gather round
Till the flames are all done
Passing down their words of wisdom
Talking about a schoolyard crush
And two wheeled bikes
A few rolling papers on those Friday nights
Drink with good people
Get high as a kite
Before they drift away
Out of mind and out of sight
Well, that's not to say you lose
Everything and everyone
Hear me out, take your time
And watch the setting sun
Take your hands out of your pockets
Feel the water run
Don't worry about tomorrow and yesterday
Is gone
The words that he said
Still echoing in my head
Don't sell your soul for money, son
Means nothing when you're dead
We all walk the same round here
Our blood is pumpin' red
Feel the struggle, feel the pain
Keep a level head
Find a beautiful love
Look straight into their eyes
Make sure they know
They're your morning light
And that you'll never let go
Till the day that you die
This here is love
This here is life

I'll tear through town like a hurricane

I'll drink your beer

8,Democracy,The Lumineers,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-lumineers/democracy-chords-2824988,"It's coming through a hole in the air
From those nights in Tiananmen Square
It's coming from the feel that this ain't exactly real
Or it's real, but it ain't exactly there
From the wars against disorder
From the sirens night and day
From the fires of the homeless
From the ashes of the gay
Democracy is coming to the USA
It's coming through a crack in the wall
On a visionary flood of alcohol
From the staggering account of the Sermon on the Mount
Which I don't pretend to understand at all
It's coming from the silence on the dock of the bay
From the brave, the bold, the battered heart of Chevrolet
Democracy is coming to the USA
It's coming from the sorrow in the street
The holy places where the races meet
From the homicidal bitchin'
That goes down in every kitchen
To determine who will serve and who will eat
From the wells of disappointment
Where the women kneel to pray
For the grace of God in the desert here
And the desert far away
Democracy is coming to the USA
Sail on, sail on
O mighty ship of state
To the shores of need
Past the reefs of greed
Through the squalls of hate
Sail on, sail on, sail on
It's coming to America first
The cradle of the best, of the worst
It's here they've got the range
And the machinery for change
And it's here they've got the spiritual thirst
It's here the family's broken
And it's here the lonely say
That the heart has got to open
In a fundamental way
Democracy is coming to the USA
It's coming from the women and the men
Oh baby, we'll be making love again
We'll be going down so deep
That the river's going to weep
And the mountain's gonna shout ""Amen""
It's coming like the tidal flood beneath the lunar sway
Imperial, mysterious, in amorous array
Democracy is coming to the USA
Sail on, sail on
O mighty ship of state
To the shores of need
Past the reefs of greed
Through the squalls of hate
Sail on, sail on, sail on
I'm sentimental, if you know what I mean
Oh, I love the country, but I can't stand the scene
And I'm neither left or right, I'm just staying home tonight
Getting lost in that hopeless little screen
But I'm stubborn as those garbage bags that time cannot decay
I'm junk, but I'm still holding up this little wild bouquet
Democracy is coming to, to the USA
  To the USA
  To the USA
  To the USA

To write sonnets for you I could sing
It was cold in October
When you rode yourself over
To pull on my shoulder to say
It took a mighty long time and too much wasted wine
To find a man who looks at me this way
But I'd fight any roughneck I'd stop any river
If it meant that I could just lie here forever
In the grips of a woman
Sends shivers down spines
Makes you recall your forgotten good times
When you wake in the morning
To the sound of me snoring
My ragged face by your side
Pray that you know
All my dreams and my hopes
Have you holding me the day that I die
And I know that I'm nothing but I am not bluffing
When I say you're meant for the sky
Cause beauty that holy and heart so kind
Deserves a place it can fly
But I'd fight any roughneck I'd stop any river
If it meant that I could just lie here forever
In the grips of a woman
Sends shivers down spines
Makes you recall your forgotten good times

It's enough to drive me crazy

Never givin up never turn it down
Same back then as it is right now

Rock it wherever I roll
I got that old country

I wouldn't trade it for gold
Some day write it on my stone
I got that old country, old country soul
I'm a blue ribbon on a PBR
Countin blessin's and countin stars
Memories in a mason jar that won't let me go
Like an old guitar on a brand new song
Just cause you leave don't mean you're gone

That’s when I crossed the county line
It’s there I saw in Seneca Creek
A girl named Ruth who washed her feet
I told her my name was RC Farris
That I’d marry her with half a karat
She said ""I do, but no stone can reach
""The prettiest shine of this here creek""
The mud was deep and the roads were wide
We’d retreat and then re-take the lines
Korean winters had torn me down
And killed all the boys from my hometown
But I’m coming home, Ruth, my dear
I got money in my pocket, don’t you fear
We’ll build a life by Seneca Creek
You’ll have everything you’ll ever need
Let’s build a home by Seneca Creek
And raise ourselves a family
I’ll work on the farm, you work the store
We’ll have everything we ever hoped for
With the top of a mountain above our heads
And the roar of Seneca by the bed
Seneca Creek
And sure enough, the hard times came
You loved yours, I did the same
But we made it through the winter’s cold
And many summers young and old
In ’85 the creek did rise
But it only took the other side
The Gandee, North Fork, and South Branch too
The house still stood that I built for you
In ’94 when you got sick
We’d make up trips for the hell of it
Take my hand, Ruth, my dear
I’ll take you back to any year
And now you lie on the hill up high
Right beneath the mountain sky
Seneca Creek sings below
Atop the tree sits a lonely crow
We built a home by Seneca Creek
And raised ourselves a family
I worked on the farm, you worked the store
We had everything we'd ever hoped for
With the top of a mountain above our heads
And the roar of Seneca by the bed

I miss you in Chattanooga
I drive through there all the time
And I listen to you when I feel like crying
It reminds me of what used to be mine
I miss your shirt that didn't fit right
I've worn it to sleep once or twice
I try not to go where I first met you
It reminds me of what used to be mine
I only see you on occasion
Some form of you, not in real life
Right now your picture's all over Atlanta
No matter which way that I drive
It reminds me of what used to be mine

I showed up a hair too late
Back slider in the back row
With a heavy heart and a head ache
It's just a couple miles from my house, but I don't go a lot

I'm floating around on a cloud inside
When my cloud starts coming apart at the seams
Oh Sarah, that's when I slide
Well there's going to be times that I gotta go away
But don't worry baby I'll come home
Out on the road is where I'm going to find my way
But I'll always find the time when I'm alone
So forgive me if sometimes I seem a little crazy
But god damn, sometimes crazy is how I feel
And my brain is starting to swirl
Down the drain of this old world
And there's only one thing girl I know is real
It's the love that I feel in your arms
It's the glow you wear around you like a charm
It's the tender in your eyes
That keeps me safe and warm at night
From this life
Sometimes this life feels like a big old dream
I'm floating around on a cloud inside
When my cloud starts coming apart at the seams
Oh Sarah, that's when I slide

And it’s empty… so right now I don’t feel a thing
I’ll be hurtin’… when I wake up on the floor, and I’ll be over… it… by noon
It ain’t a problem… they’ll always sell me more
But you’re forgiveness… that’s something I can’t buy, there ain’t a thing… that I… can do
That’s the difference, between whiskey and you
One’s the devil… one keeps driving me insane
At times I wonder… if they ain’t both the same
But one’s a liar… that helps to hide me from my pain , and one’s a long… gone… bitter truth
That’s the difference, between whiskey and you
I’ve got a problem… but it ain’t like what you think
I drink because I’m lonesome… and I’m lonesome ‘cause I drink
If I don’t break down… and bring it on myself, it’ll hit… out of… the blue
That’s the difference, between the whiskey and you
One’s the devil… one keeps driving me insane
At times I wonder… if they ain’t both the same
But one’s a liar… that helps to hide me from my pain , and one’s a long… gone… bitter truth

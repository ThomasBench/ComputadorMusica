Than throw rocks at things that shine
Well, you oughta be chasin' your own dreams
'Stead of shootin' holes in mine
Then again, keep it comin', keep your big mouth runnin'
Keep kickin' me while I'm down
Hop on the bandwagon, man, while you can
Better doubt me now
Keep buildin' that chip up on my shoulder
Keep feedin' that monkey on my back
I can feel your hot air blowin' in colder
Stokin' this fire up under my ass
Got me livin' for the day, gonna see my face
Big as life and laughin' out loud
Lovin' all you haters
Beggin' you to doubt me now
Like a walk-on quarterback, a wannabe Cadillac
A backup to the third string
I'm outside the box, ain't got no shot
At the bullseye or the brass ring
Yeah, I heard it all, bet you thought I'd crawl
Under a rock and never wanna come out
But I'll never let you give me a reason
To doubt me now
Keep buildin' that chip up on my shoulder
Keep feedin' that monkey on my back
I can feel your hot air blowin' in colder
Stokin' this fire up under my ass
Got me livin' for the day, gonna see my face
Big as life and laughin' out loud
Lovin' all you haters
Beggin' you to doubt me now, C'mon!
Yeah, keep buildin' that chip up on my shoulder
Keep feedin' that monkey on my back
I can feel your hot air blowin' in colder
Stokin' this fire up under my ass
Got me livin' for the day, gonna see my face

Lovin' all you haters
Beggin' you to doubt me now
Yeah, I love all you haters
Come on and doubt me now
Try and doubt me now

So I bought a statue of Jesus
And listen to Abby's old high school demos
And smoked a bag of reefer
I got bills coming up, debts still due
And I've got too much on my mind
To stay in the moment
It's always blowing out the windows and into the night
Stay behind me
My one sweet Loraine
Stay in the shadow of the tower that fell
Build me a castle, Maria, I'd pray
Take these weeds outta my head
When I'm barely living and almost dead

Almost dead
I'm sick of getting lifted
Sick of going under
Tired of giving too much
I've been down in a hole for so long
I don't know if any love could fill it back up
I gotta move on and learn the times to be brave
Can't live in them old mistakes
And I remember what TK said:
""You can't steer no boat by looking back at the wake""

  First time I met you, knew I never could forget you, girl
You always saw the blue skies past the rain clouds in my eyes
There's music in your laughter from the floor up to the rafters
You're that happy ever after I've been after my whole life
  Who knows where I'd be without you?
  No, I just couldn't be without you
I'll just say ""Amen""
I can count 'em on one hand
But honey, look there on your finger
I'd say I'm a lucky man
God made two lovers out of strangers
A little house on a little land
A little creek, a little Jeep
Same old moon everybody sees
  It sure ain't hard to count your blessings
Yesterday we celebrated our first year together
And together still feels better than that first night we met
  I never dreamed that you could be so perfectly created, girl
He made a perfect angel, and he made you just for me
  Who knows where I'd be without you?
  No, I just couldn't be without you
I'll just say ""Amen""

No, I can't count 'em on both hands
But honey, look here at this picture
I'd say we're a lucky fam
I'm thankful to be with you
A little house on a little land
Couple kids, two or three
Same old song that we'll always sing

Always take time to count your blessings

What anyone would call a flaw
You say a pearl without the pressure
Wouldn't be a pearl at all
When my demons come a-calling
You don't even bat an eye
I don't scare you and I guess that's why

How's it all playin' out?

Just wish you didn't grow so quick

Thought you were never gonna come back down
Throw some coffee on the pot
Let's sit and talk about
How we thought you were never gonna come back down

Look who's back in town
Did you fall down from your throne
Or did you lose your crown?

Look how much you've grown

In dive bars and dance halls

And picking out the nursery coloured walls

Now I'm on the losing side

Mom and Dad did the best they could
To raise me the right way
And I lean more their own and I started writing songs
And thinking I had something to say
So every week at the Food Lion
All the other parents boast
About their kids graduating, getting higher educations
And the big city jobs that they chose

Face-down in the gum on the floor
I was hopin' that she'd change her mind
But I swear as she walked down the stairs
She didn't even wave goodbye
Didn't even wave goodbye
Ray Dixon didn't take no lip
He'd kick you right off the bus
Stop by your house on the way out of the holler
And tell your momma where you was
He didn't need no driver's aid
To keep a bunch of kids in line
All he needed was a glare in the mirror
And a paddle that he carved from pine
Blisterin' punk kids alive (Oh, blister 'em)
This is where we dropped off the prettiest little girl
Same grade as me
I held onto hope for eight long years
And by the time that I turned sixteen
I wasn't awkward, I's a real smooth talker
With my very own pickup truck
I'd take her home and if her parents weren't around
She'd bring me in and give me some
Bring me in and give me some
Safe to say nowadays ol' Ray
Can't keep a route very long
And I'm glad the little girl's dad
Never found out what was goin' on
I know he'd kill me in a minute
And he wouldn't have left no trace
Hogs'll eat 'bout anything you give 'em
And they don't let nothin' go to waste
Don't let nothin' go to waste
This is where we dropped off the prettiest little girl
Same grade as me

After riding thirteen hours I was ready to get my feet off of the train
Reminded of what happened in Wichita, St. Paul, and Abilene
Somewhere in the distance I was followed by the darker side of me
I stumbled through the city looking for a place that I could lay my head
But first I needed work because it'd been a couple days since I've been fed
On the shores of Lake Michigan I found a spot where I could finally breathe
I slept next to the water and I dreamt about the darker side of me
When I woke I found a fishing boat loading up it's nets to meet the day
The captain walked up to me and offered me a job and a place to stay
He promised he'd feed me and I could sleep inside his boat when the day was done
I could feel the darkness fading as we sailed off in the early morning sun
The next two months were filled with the longest days that I had ever seen
The work was never ending and I barely had the time to eat or sleep
We hauled four hundred pounds of salmon from the cold and frigid water everyday
After all my days of toiling I forgot about the darker side of me
When the season finally ended I went and asked the captain for my pay
When I walked into his office, he claimed he didn't have a dime for me
He said I owed him money for sleeping inside his boat every night
When I heard the bogus charges I could feel the darkness churning deep inside
I closed the door behind me and offered him a chance to come clean
I'm here for all my money and I'm not the type of man that walks away
He laughed and spit at me and said there ain't no way in hell I'm getting paid
But his laughter fell to silence as I introduced him to the darker side of me
As I pulled out of Milwaukee I could feel my head and back begin to sway
I'll be riding thirteen hours and I'm ready to get my feet off of the train
Reminded of what happened in Gillsburg, Flagstaff, and Milwaukee
Somewhere in the distance I keep running from the darker side of me
If we meet inside a boxcar may you never see the darker side of me

Singing softly to the savior like a friend
They taught me how to make the chords and sing the words
I'm still singing like that great speckled bird

You can kiss me goodnight or kiss me goodbye

Hunkered by the shed of Detroit General & Company
Calling, boy come out, we have you jailed
Beside the buck-shot door, I stood still
Wondering how the hell the bastards found me in those hills
And clinging to a letter that I wish I'd mailed
Go rest easy, Madeline
I'm bringing down the bank across this flooded county line
And when I get home, we'll have a grand old time
But don't you shed no tears or be surprised
If you get the word that your wild man has up and died
Just set me up a stone on that high hillside
Now in the pouring snow, sad, but swift
I headed down the highway
Hoping that the burden of my blues would lift
And praying that the whiskey would keep me brave
Oh, but I got caught in the cold
Looking like a hobo without no mercy from the road
And feeling like a dead man without a grave
Go rest easy, Madeline
I'm bringing down the bank across this flooded county line
And when I get home, we'll have a grand old time
But don't you shed no tears or be surprised
If you get the word that your wild man has up and died
Just set me up a stone on that high hillside
Oh my, oh my
Bloodied-up and chained, my legs pinned down
I woke to find my fate in the hands of four men gathered 'round
And cursing for the bag they knew I'd hid
And the more they stomped and moaned, the more I prayed
Feeling every spark flying off of that file and their rusted blade
Said, better think it through, this is your last chance, kid
Go rest easy, Madeline
I'm bringing down the bank across this flooded county line
And when I get home, we'll have a grand old time
But don't you shed no tears or be surprised
If you get the word that your wild man has up and died
Just set me up a stone on that high hillside

Your dress, my jeans painted a helluva scene from the night before
Last thing i wanna do is get in my truck
Aw fingers crossed that chevy don't fire up
Cause girl you make it hard to leave, you got some kind of hold on me
You drive me wild, giving me that smile in my shirt in these sheets.
Girl I can't make these boots take a single step away from you
Got a goodbye kiss that gets the best of me
Girl you make it hard to leave
Wish i had a dime for every single time you made me late
workin these long hours, might get me fired but thats okay
Id trade 10 long hours on the roof in this summer heat
for another 5 minutes with you in this bed with me

You drive me wild, giving me that smile in my shirt in these sheets.
Girl I can't make these boots take a single step away from you
Got a goodbye kiss that gets the best of me

Lying here with you, the whole world can wait
Theres just something about you girl that makes it easy to stay.
Hard to leave, she got some kind of hold on me.

Trying to keep away those cold sweat fears
And glory, glory
We are awaitin'
That sweet someday
When we leave our troubles
And are taken
So far away
Well, I hate to see the winter bring that dreadful cold
It never did nobody any good
Burning up in the summer, hauling those heavy loads
And Heaven knows, I'd quit it if I could
And glory, glory
We are awaitin'
That sweet someday
When we leave our troubles
And are taken
So far away
Sometimes when I'm drinking, I sit alone and wait
For the sun to fade out from the sky
And I wish I was leaving to find another fate
And all the while knowing where I'll die
And glory, glory
We are awaitin'
That sweet someday
When we leave our troubles

Hangin' on a mango kiss
Hear the waves and the breeze and the Joshua trees
It was just about as good as it gets
Taste the salt on the rim, feel the sand on your skin
And the wild in the wind like I'm right there again
Under a moon over Mexico
Holdin' onto you as the low tide rolls
Whatever that buzz was, I ain't felt it since
But I can't seem to let it go
And there was a shine in the dark, a flame from a spark
And a lime in a Pacifico
Under a moon            over Mexico
The second I left I was kickin' myself
'Cause I knew I should've stayed
Still tequila love drunk, from us wakin' up
Under the Cabo palm leaf shade
And it's crazy I know, but I'd give anything to go
To you and me on that coast, in the midnight glow
Of a moon over Mexico
Holdin' onto you as the low tide rolls
Whatever that buzz was, I ain't felt it since
But I can't seem to let it go
And there was a shine in the dark, a flame from a spark
And a lime in a Pacifico

Maps don't do much for me, friend
I follow the weather and the wind
I'm hitch hikin' all day long
Got what I can carry and my song
I'm a rolling stone just rolling on
Catch me now 'cause tomorrow, I'll be gone
Family man gives me a ride
Got his pregnant Sally at his side
Yes indeed, sir, children are a gift
Thank you kindly for the lift
I'm hitch hikin' all day long
Trucker gears his engine down
Says, ""Climb on up, son, I'm highway-bound""
Dashboard picture of a pretty girl
I'm ridin' high on top of the world
I'm hitch hikin' all day long
Gearhead in a souped-up '72
Wants to show a kid just what this thing'll do
Telephone poles and trees go whizzin' by
Thank you, pal, she sure can fly
I'm hitch hikin' all day long
I'm hitch hikin' all day long
I'm hitch hikin' all day long
It's the same sad story, love and glory goin' 'round and 'round
It's the same old cliché, a wanderer on his way, slippin' from town to town
Some find peace here on the sweet streets, the sweet streets of home
Where kindness falls and your heart calls for a permanent place of your own
I'm a wayfarer, baby, I drift from town to town
When everyone's asleep and the midnight bells sound
My wheels are hissin' up the highway, spinning 'round and 'round
You start out slow in a sweet little bungalow, something two can call home
Then rain comes fallin', the blues come calling, and you're left with a heart of stone
Some folks are inspired sitting by the fire, slippers tucked under the bed
But when I go to sleep I can't count sheep for the white lines in my head
I'm a wayfarer, baby, I drift from town to town
When everyone's asleep and the midnight bells sound
My wheels are hissin' up the highway, spinning 'round and 'round
Where are you now, where are you now?, where are you now?
I'm a wayfarer, baby, I drift from town to town
When everyone's asleep and the midnight bells sound
My wheels are hissin' up the highway, spinning 'round and 'round
I'm a wayfarer, baby
I'm a wayfarer, baby
I'm a wayfarer, baby (Wayfarer, baby)
I'm a wayfarer, baby (Wayfarer, baby)

I got so down and out in 'Frisco
Tired of the pills and the rain
I picked up, headed for the sunshine
I left a good thing behind
Seemed all of our love was in vain
My baby's coming in on the Tucson train
I come here looking for a new life
One I wouldn't have to explain
To that voice that keeps me awake at night
When a little peace would make everything right
If I could just turn off my brain
Now my baby's coming in on the Tucson train
We fought hard over nothing
We fought till nothing remained
I've carried that nothing for a long time
Now I carry my operator's license
And spend my days just running this crane
My baby's coming in on the Tucson train
Hard work'll clear your mind and body
The hard sun will burn out the pain
If they're looking for me, tell 'em buddy
I'm waiting down at the station
Just praying to the five-fifteen
I'll wait all God's creation
Just to show her a man can change
Now my baby's coming in on the Tucson train
  On the Tucson train
  On the Tucson train
  Waiting on the five-fifteen
Here she comes
I wake up in the morning, just glad my boots are on
Instead of empty in the whispering grasses down the Five at Forest Lawn
On the set, the makeup girl brings me two raw eggs and a shot of gin
Then I give it all up for that little blue pill that promises to bring it all back to you again
Ride me down easy, ride me down easy, friend
Tonight the western stars are shining bright again
Here in the canyons above Sunset, the desert don't give up the fight
A coyote with someone's Chihuahua in its teeth skitters 'cross my veranda in the night
Some lost sheep from Oklahoma sips her Mojito down at the Whiskey Bar
Smiles and says she thinks she remembers me from that commercial with the credit card
Hell, these days there ain't no more, now there's just again
Tonight the western stars are shining bright again
Some days I take my El Camino, throw my saddle in and go
East to the desert where the charros, they still ride and rope
Our American brothers cross the wire and bring the old ways with them
Tonight the western stars are shining bright again
Once I was shot by John Wayne, yeah, it was towards the end
That one scene's bought me a thousand drinks, set me up and tell it for you, friend
Here's to the cowboys, riders in the whirlwind
Tonight the western stars are shining bright again
And the western stars are shining bright again
Tonight the riders on Sunset are smothered in the Santa Ana winds
And the western stars are shining bright again
C'mon and ride me down easy, ride me down easy, friend
'Cause tonight the western stars are shining bright again
I woke up this morning just glad my boots were on
There's a place out on the highway 'cross the San Bernardino line
Where the truckers and the bikers gather every night at the same time
At seven the band comes in and locals dance the night away
At Sleepy Joe's Café
I drive on down from the big town Friday when the clock strikes five
As the red sun sets in the ocean, I start to come alive
Summer girls in the parking lot slap on their makeup and they flirt the night away
At Sleepy Joe's Café
Joe came home in '45 and took out a G.I. loan
On a sleepy little spot and Army cook could call his own
He married May, the highway come in and they woke up to find
They were sitting on top of a pretty little gold mine
Saturday night the lights are bright as the folks pour in from town
Joe keeps the blues playin', at the bar May lays the beers down
I come through the door and feel the workweek slip away
See you out on the floor and Monday morning's a million miles away
At Sleepy Joe's Café
Sleepy Joe's Café
Sleepy Joe's Café
I got two pins in my ankle and a busted collarbone
A steel rod in my leg, but it walks me home
At nine, I climbed high into the boughs of our neighborhood's tallest tree
I don't remember the fear, just the breeze
Drive fast, fall hard, I'll keep you in my heart
Don't worry about tomorrow, don't mind the scars
Just drive fast, fall hard
At nineteen, I was the king of the dirt down at the Remington draw
I liked the pedal and I didn't mind the wall
'Midst the roar of the metal I never heard a sound
I was looking for anything, any kind of drug to lift me up off this ground
Drive fast, fall hard, I'll keep you in my heart
Don't worry about tomorrow, don't mind the scars
Just drive fast, fall hard
We met on the set of this B picture that she made
She liked her guys a little greasy, 'neath her pay grade
We headed down to Baja in the desert, we made our stand of it
Figured maybe together we could get the broken pieces to fit
Drive fast, fall hard, keep me in your heart
Yeah, don't worry about tomorrow, don't mind the scars
Just drive fast, fall hard, I'll keep you in my heart
Yeah, don't worry about tomorrow, don't mind the scars
Just drive fast, fall hard
I got two pins in my ankle and a busted collarbone
A steel rod in my leg, but it walks me home
Guess it was somethin' I shouldn't have done
Guess I regret it now
Ever since I was a kid
Tryin' to keep my temper down
Chasin' wild horses, chasin' wild horses
Chasin' wild horses
Left my home, left my friends
I didn't say goodbye
I contract out to the BLM
Up on the Montana line
Chasin' wild horses, chasin' wild horses
We're out before sunup
In after sundown
There's two men in the chopper
Two under saddle on the ground
In the evenings we'd hop in the pickup
Head into town for a drink
Make sure I work 'til I'm so damn tired
Way too tired to think
You lose track of time
It's all just storms blowin' through
You come rollin' 'cross my mind
Your hair flashin' in the blue
Like wild horses, just like wild horses
Just like wild horses
Fingernail moon in a twilight sky
Ridin' high grass of the switchback
I shout your name into the canyon
The echo throws it back
The winter snow whites out the plains
'Til it can turn me blind
The only thing up here I've found
Is tryin' to get you off my mind
Chasin' wild horses, chasin' wild horses
Chasin' wild horses, chasin' wild horses
I'm 25 hundred miles from where I wanna be
It feels like a hundred years since you've been near to me
I guess what goes around, baby, comes around
Just wishing you were here with me, in Sundown
Sundown ain't the kind of place you want to be on your own
It's all long, hot, endless days and cold nights all alone
I drift from bar to bar, here in lonely town
Just wishing you were here with me, come sundown
In Sundown the cafés are filled with lovers passing time
In Sundown all I've got's trouble on my mind
So I work all day out here on the county line
I tell myself it's all just gonna work out in time
When summer's through, you'll come around
That little voice in my head's all that keeps me from sinking down
Come Sundown
When summer's through, you'll come around
That little voice in my head's all that keeps me from sinking down
Come Sundown
Came into town with a pocketful of songs
I made the rounds but I didn't last long
Now I'm out on this highway with a bone-cold chill
Somewhere north of Nashville
I lie awake in the middle of the night
Makin' a list of things that I didn't do right
With you at the top of a long page filled
Here, somewhere north of Nashville
For the deal I made, the price was strong
I traded you for this song
We woke each morning with hearts filled
Bluebird of love on the windowsill
Now the heart's unsteady, and the night is still
All I've got's this melody, and time to kill
Here, somewhere north of Nashville
Here, somewhere north of Nashville
Here, somewhere north of Nashville
I woke up this morning with stones in my mouth
Said those were only the lies you've told me
Those are only the lies you've told me
I pulled my collar to the wind and spit them on the ground
You said those are only the lies you've told me
Those are only the lies you've told me
Sat on the edge of our bed in the sun
I felt them gather on my tongue
I woke up this morning with stones in my mouth
You said those are only the lies you've told me
Those are only the lies you've told me
The dirt-brown winter field a thousand black crows cover the ground
You say those are only the lies you've told me
Those are only the lies you've told me
The autumn wind blows through the trees as the dark leaves come tumbling down
You say those are only the lies you've told me
Those are only the lies you've told me
I walk a highway washed in sun
I feel weight gather on my tongue
I woke up this morning with stones in my mouth
You said those are only the lies you've told me
Those are only the lies you've told me
Those are only the lies you've told me (Only the lies you've told me)
Those are only the lies you've told me (Only the lies you've told me)
Those are only the lies you've told me (Only the lies you've told me)
Those are only the lies you've told me
I woke up this morning with stones in my mouth
Sunrise, sundown
The streets gone golden brown
Auburn skies above
I'm searching for my love
I'm searching for my love
There goes my miracle
Walking away, walking away
There goes my miracle
Walking away, walking away
Moonlight, moon bright
Where's my lucky star tonight?
The streets lost in lamp light
Then suddenly in sight
Suddenly in sight
There goes my miracle
Walking away, walking away
There goes my miracle
Walking away, walking away
Look what you've done
Look what you've done
Look what you've done, ah
Look what you've done (Look what you've done)
Look what you've done (Look what you've done)
Look what you've done, ah
Look what we've done (Look what we've done)
Look what we've done (Look what we've done)
Look what we've done, ah
Heartache, heartbreak
Love gives, love takes
The book of love holds its rules
Disobeyed by fools
Disobeyed by fools
There goes my miracle
Walking away, walking away
There goes my miracle
Walking away, walking away
Walking away, walking away
There goes my miracle
Sunrise, sundown
Had enough of heartbreak and pain
I had a little sweet spot for the rain
Hello sunshine, won't you stay?
You know I always liked my walking shoes
But you can get a little too fond of the blues
Hello sunshine, won't you stay?
You know I always loved a lonely town
Those empty streets, no one around
You fall in love with lonely, you end up that way
Hello sunshine, won't you stay?
You know I always liked that empty road
No place to be and miles to go
But miles to go is miles away
Hello sunshine, won't you stay?
And miles to go is miles away
Hello sunshine, won't you stay?
Hello sunshine, won't you stay?
  Hello sunshine
There's a place on a blank stretch of road where
Nobody travels and nobody goes and the
Deskman says these days 'round here
Where two young folks could probably up and disappear into
Rustlin' sheets, a sleepy corner room
Into the musty smell
Of wilted flowers and lazy afternoon hours
At the Moonlight Motel
Now the pool's filled with empty, eight foot deep
Got dandelions growin' up through the cracks in the concrete
Chain-link fence half-rusted away
Got a sign, says, ""Children, be careful how you play""
Your lipstick taste and your whispered secret
I promised I'd never tell
A half-drunk beer and your breath in my ear
At the Moonlight Motel
Well then, it's bills and kids and kids and bills
And the ringing of the bell
Across the valley floor through the dusty screen door
Of the Moonlight Motel
Last night I dreamed of you, my lover
And the wind blew through the window and blew off the covers
Of my lonely bed, I woke to something you said
That it's better to have loved, yeah, it's better to have loved
As I drove, there was a chill in the breeze
And leaves tumbled from the sky and fell
On a road so black as I backtracked
To the Moonlight Motel
She was boarded up and gone like an old summer song
Nothing but an empty shell
I pulled in and stopped into my old spot
I pulled a bottle of Jack out of a paper bag
Poured one for me and one for you as well
Then it was one more shot poured out onto the parking lot
To the Moonlight Motel

I remember the sound of our roof in the rain
And my mind goes back in time to a place so far gone
Where the love we left behind us was still new
We were listenin' to a record on the end of your bed
Not givin' thought to where it was all goin'
 And I wished right then and there so badly I could read your mind
Just so I could know the things that you were knowin'
I believe, yes, I do
The hardest part is always leaving love behind
I believe, yes, I do
That everything we lose will be a gift in time
But the hardest part is leaving love behind
When it was time to say goodbye, those words came down like stones
I admit for so long after it was hard to feel at home
We would hear the highway's song shifting down in the night
I was grateful that the echoes broke the quiet
I believe, yes, I do
The hardest part is always leaving love behind
I believe, yes, I do
That everything we lose will be a gift in time
But the hardest part is leaving love behind
The sun fades on me now and I miss you like words can't know
And I missed my shot at dyin' young a long time ago
It's just a lesson learned in love, it's not angry, it's not sad
Sometimes you gotta lose something to know what you have
I believe (I believe), yes, I do

I believe (I believe), yes, I do

   nobody know me, oh well, it's hard to complain from this 5 star hotel
always in a rush, thinking too much, but keep it on the hush, we need to know, just us
that's really all it takes,  we don't need nothing but today
The world is so small 'til it ain't
I'm building up a wall 'til it breaks
she hate it when I call and it's late
I don't to keep you waiting, I hope I never keep you waiting
turn it up, turn it down, spin it up
I've got a bad attidude, play until I'm out of moves
no need for shame, I get peace at slow speeds
go beat the game, young control freak
it's cold in my veins, I'm below freezing snow, super made me...
     they know that I still need my space, I don't want to grow old so I smoke just in case
    she saying that I glow below the waist, and the stroke is just so PGA
got a little bit of space and time drawing shapes and lines of the world we made
tomorrow might be right around the corner, but I swear it's gon' be worth it, if I make you wait,
         somewhere above you keep reaching up,
that's really all it takes.....you don't need nothing but today
The world is so small 'til it ain't
I'm building up a wall 'til it breaks
she hate it when I call and it's late
I don't to keep you waiting, I hope I never keep you waiting
I can feel my fingers slippin in the month of fuckin' its and I'll be gone
do you want it all if it's all me to you
staring at the wall and the wall full of books
  looking at my dreams, who I want to be, I guess you got to see
I been a fool but it's cool that's what human beings do
keep your eye to the sky, never glued to your shoe
guess there was a time when my mind was consumed
sun coming out, the clouds are gonna move, don't tell me nothing but the truth
I'm tired. I don't got a spare second
win or lose, don't keep counting nobody checkin'

0,Just To See You Smile (verÂ 4),Tim McGraw,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tim-mcgraw/just-to-see-you-smile-chords-1460547,"You always had an eye for things that glitter
but I was far from being made of gold
I don't know how but I scraped up the money
I just never could quite tell you no
Just like when you were leaving Amarillo
Takin' that new job in Tennessee
and I quit mine so we could be together
I can't forget the way you looked at me
Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
when all is said and done
I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's lost
Just to see you smile
When you said time was all you really needed
I walked away and let you have your space
Cause leaving didn't hurt me near as badly
as the tears I saw rolling down your face
and yesterday I knew just what you wanted
when you came walking up to me with him
so I told you that I was happy for you
and given the chance I'd lie again
Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
when all is said and done
I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's   lost
Just to see you smile
Just to see you smile
I'd do anything that you wanted me to
when all is said and done
I'd never count the cost
It's worth all that's  lost
Just to see you smile

1,The River,Garth Brooks,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/garth-brooks/the-river-chords-62623,"You know a dream is like a river ever changin' as it flows.
And the dreamer's just a vessel  that must follow where it goes.
Trying to learn from what's behind you, and never knowing what's in store
Makes each day a constant battle just to stay between the shores
And I will sail my   vessel 'til the river runs dry.
Like a bird upon the wind,  these water's are my sky.
I'll never    reach my destination  if I never try.
So, I will sail my   vessel 'till the river runs dry.
2: Too many times we stand aside and let the water slip away
'Til what we put off 'til tomorrow has now become today.
So, don't you sit upon the shorline and say you're satisfied.
Choose to chance the rapids and dare to dance the tide.
And I will sail my   vessel 'til the river runs dry.
Like a bird upon the wind,  these water's are my sky.
I'll never    reach my destination  if I never try.
So, I will sail my   vessel 'till the river runs dry.
And there's bound to be rough waters and I know I'll take some falls.
But with the Good Lord as my captain, I can make it through them all.
Yes, I will sail my vessel  'til the river runs dry.
Like a bird upon the wind,  these water's are my sky.
I'll never    reach my destination if I never try.
So, I will sail my   vessel 'till the river runs dry.
Yes, I will sail my   vessel 'till the river runs dry.
  'til the river runs dry.

ever changing as it flows

I can make it through them all.
Makes each day a constant battle

And I will sail my vessel

I'll never reach my destination
if I never try so I will sail my vessel
Till the River runs dry.
Too many times we stand aside
and let the waters slip away
Till what we've put off till tomorrow
So don't you sit upon the
shoreline
Choose to chance the rapids
and dare to dance the tide.
And I will sail my vessel
till the River runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
these waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination
if I never try so I will sail my vessel
Till the River runs dry.
Well there's bound to be rough waters
and I know I'll take some falls
But with the Good Lord as my Captain
I can make it through them all.
Yes I will sail my vessel
till the River runs dry
Like a bird upon the wind
these waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination

Till the River runs dry.
Yes I will sail my vessel Till the River runs dry.

3,That Summer,Garth Brooks,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/garth-brooks/that-summer-chords-62620,"I went to work for her that summer
A teenage kid so far from home
She was a lonely widow woman
Hell bent to make it on her own
We were a thousands miles from nowhere
Wheat fields as far as I could see
Both needing something from eachother
Not knowing yet what that might be
Till she came to me one evening
hot cup of coffee and a smile
In a dress that I was certain
She hadn't worn in quite a while
There was a difference in her laughter
There was a softness in her eyes
And on the air there was a hunger
Even a boy could recognize
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch the storm and all it's wonders
Raging in her lovers eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright
Rushing headlong in the wind
Out where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night
That summer wind was all around me
Nothing between us but the night
And when I told her that I'd never
She softly whispered that's alright
And then I watched her hands of leather
Turn to velvet in a touch
There's never been another summer
When I have ever learned so much
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch the storm and all it's wonders
Raging in her lovers eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright
Rushing headlong in the wind
Out where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night
I often think about that summer
The sweat the moonlight and the lace
And I have rarely held another
When I haven't seen her face
And everytime I pass a wheat field
And watch it dancing in the wind
Although I know it isn't real
I just can't help but feel her lonely arms again
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the sky
To watch the storm and all it's wonders
Raging in her lovers eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright
Rushing headlong in the wind
Out where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night
Rushing headlong in the wind
Out where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night

In my faded leather jacket and my weathered Brogan shoes
A chill north wind was blowin' but the spring was comin' on
As I wondered to myself just how long had I been gone
So I strolled across old Main Street, walked down a flight of stairs
Stepped into the hall and saw all my friends were there
A neon sign was flashin' ""Welcome come on in""
It feels so good feelin' good again
My favorite band was playing' an Otis Redding song
When they sang the chorus everybody sang along
Dan and Margarita were swayin' side by side
I heard they were divorcin' but I guess they let it slide
And I wished I had some money with which to buy a round
I wished I'd cashed my paycheck before I came to town
But I reached into my pocket found three twenties and a ten
It feels so good feelin' good again
There was old man Perkins sittin' on his stool
Watchin' Butch and Jimmy John talkin' loud and playing pool
The boys from Silver City were standin' by the fire
Singin' like they thought they were the Tabernacle choir
And I wanted you to see them all, I wished that you were there
I looked across the room and saw you standin' on the stair
And when I caught your eye I saw you break into a grin
It feels so good feelin' good again
I wanted you to see them all, I wished that you were there
I looked across the room and saw you standin' on the stair
And when I caught your eye I saw you break into a grin

he was the answer to my prayer.

to teach us how to give

and had me down on my knees
there's always been someone
to come along and comfort me
a kind word from a stranger
to lend a helping hand
a phone call from a friend
just to say I understand
Now ain't it kind of funny
at the dark end of the road
someone lights the way with just a single ray of hope.

show up in the strangest places

Though she looked a little worried and weak
She tried to pretend he wasn't drinkin' again
But Daddy'd left the proof on her cheek
I was only eight years old    that summer
And I always seemed to be in the way
So I took myself down to the fair   in town
On   Independence Day
Well, word   gets around in a small, small town
They said he was a dangerous man
But Mama was proud and she stood her ground
but She knew she was on the losing end
Some folks whispered, some folks talked
But everybody looked the other way
And when time ran out, there was no one about
On    Independence Day
Let freedom ring, let the white dove sing
Let the whole world know that today is a day of reckoning
Let the weak be strong,  let the right be wrong
Roll that stone away, let the guilty pay
It's Independence Day
Well, she lit    up the sky that Fourth   of July
By the time that the firemen come
They just put out the flames and they took down some names
And sent me to the county home
Now I ain't saying it's right    or it's wrong
But maybe it's the only way
Talk about your rev-o-lu-tion
It's    Independence Day
Let freedom ring,   let the white dove sing
Let the whole    world know that today    is a day of reckoning

I put in my time till the Pocono line
shut down two years ago
I was staying at the mission till I met Marie
now I can't stay there no more
Fella 'cross town said he's lookin' for a man
to move some old cars around
maybe me and Marie could find a burned-out van
and do a little settlin' down
Aw, but I'm just dreamin', I ain't got no ride
and the junkyard's a pretty good ways
that job's about a half week old besides
it'd be gone now anyway
Unemployment said I got no more checks
and they showed me to the hall
my brother died in Georgia some time ago
I got no one left to call
Summer wasn't bad below the bridge
a little short on food that's all
Now I gotta get Marie some kind of coat
we're headed down into fall
I used to play the mouth harp pretty good
hustled up a little dough
but I got drunk and I woke up rolled
a couple of months ago
they got my harp and they got my dollar
them low life so and so's
harps cost money and I ain't got it
it's my own fault I suppose
The Pocono's down but the Chesapeak's runnin'
two freights everyday
if it was just me I'd be headed south
but Marie can't catch no train
She's got some pain and she thinks it's a baby,
says we gotta wait and see
in my heart I know it's a little boy
hope he don't end up like me
Well, the man's still grinnin' says he lost my file
I gotta stand in line again
I want to kill him but I just say no
I had enough of that line my friend
I head back to the bridge, its getting kinda cold
I'm feelin' too low down to lie
I guess I'll just tell Marie the truth
hope she don't break down and cry
Marie she didn't wake up this morning
she didn't even try
she just rolled over and went to heaven
my little boy safe inside
I laid them in the sun where somebody'd find them
caught a Chesapeak on the fly
Marie will know I'm headed south
so's to meet me by and by

And by the way the house looked
She must have took it bad
The workers come on Monday
To fix the door and patch the wall
They say she just went crazy
The night she got the call
He was up in Wyoming
And drew a bull no man could ride
He promised her he'd turn out
Well it turned out that he lied
And all the dreams that they'd been livin'
In the california sand
Died right there beside him
In Cheyenne
They say she just went crazy
Screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean
And to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water
You'll see her footprints in the sand
the beaches of Cheyenne
They never found her body
Just her diary by the bed
It told about the fight they had
And the words that she had said
When he told her he was ridin'
She said then I don't give a damn
If you never come back from Cheyenne
They say she just went crazy
Screamin' out his name
She ran out into the ocean
And to this day they claim
That if you go down by the water
You'll see her footprints in the sand

Some say she's still alive
They'd even claim they've seen her
On the shoreline late at night
So if you go down by the water
You'll see her footprints in the sand

Down by the river on a Friday night,
pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight,
talkin' 'bout cars and dreamin' 'bout women.
Never had a plan; just-a livin' for the minute.
Yeah, âway down yonder on the Chattahoochee;
never knew how much that muddy water meant to me,
but I learned how to swim and I learned who I was;
A lot about living and a little 'bout love.

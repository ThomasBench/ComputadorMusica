0,Id Rather Be Sorry,Kris Kristofferson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/kris-kristofferson/id-rather-be-sorry-chords-1714475,"If you hurt me, you won't be the first or the last
in a lifetime of many mistakes.
But I won't spend tomorrow regretting the past for 
the chances that I didn't take.
Cause I'll never know til it's over....if I'm right 
or I'm wrong loving you.
But I'd rather be sorry for something I've done, than 
for something that I didn't do.
When you touch me it's easy to make me believe tomorrow 
won't take you away.
But I'd gamble whatever tomorrow might bring for the love 
that I'm living today.
And I'll never know til it's over....if I'm right 
or I'm wrong loving you.
But I'd rather be sorry for something I've done, than 
for something that I didn't do.
I know someday that I may wake up all alone, when the love
I believed in has died.
But at least I won't wonder what I might have won, from the
lifetime that I watched going by. 
Cause I'll never know til it's over....if I'm right 
or I'm wrong loving you.
But I'd rather be sorry for something I've done, than 
for something that I didn't do.
Yes, I'd rather be sorry for something I've done than for 
something that I didn't do.

She spread a blanket
That we laid down on and loved the world away

We found our body's lost in paradise
Like castaways
In Marina Del Rey
Like the ocean tides
Highs and lows

Tears touch my eyes for I have found
My heart has stayed

We found our body's lost in paradise

From the Charleston coast to the Jersey piers
And sharin' the road with the race car nuts and loggers
Sunday drivers scouts on hikes Hells Angels on Harley bikes
I never met a roader I didn't like cept them joggers
One day I'm rollin' down 1 0 1
I got 18 wheels and a fourteen ton
Radio playin' a good ol' country rocker
The sky was sunny and the air was clean
When up ahead on the road I seen a skinny sweatin' jogger
Well he was dressed like they do in baby blue
With shortie shorts and a headband too
I yelled Sweetie I bet that you are the hit of the men's room locker
So get your Adidas off a this road
I'm LA bound and I don't slow down for dead raccoons or joggers
Well without breakin' stride or losin' poise
He says you and that rig sure make some noise
I can't talk now I'm racin' against the clocker
And if you ain't afraid to race that heap
We'll see how that ol' rig holds up against a super jogger
Race I must be hearin' wrong
The boy's been runnin' in the sun too long
The only place he's a racin' to is a doctor
That fool yells ready get set go
And the race is on and we're off and gone me and that maniac jogger
Well now I could'a left him far behind
But I played with him like a fish on a line
And I stayed about a half a mile behind that sucker
And he sees me comin' and he starts to fly
So I pushed her to sixty and shift to high
And finally catch that jogger  and it wasn't easy
Now I'm doin' eighty and I turned to check
And he's stayin' right with me neck in neck
His hearts a thumpin' like an engine goin' bocka bocka bocka
Cause I ain't shifted into second yet
Then he unwinds and leaves me behind eaten the dust of a jogger
Then I see him a joggin' up into the sky
And he yells hey thanks for the exercise
I hope that losin' the race was not too shockin'
Ya see my dad says heaven's no place to run
I try to be an obedient son
So I come down to earth to do my joggin'
Well that's the story take it or leave it
My trucker buddies they believe it
So do those race car nuts and Harley hoggers
Cept I don't call nobody names
And I tip my hat each time I pass one of them good old joggers
And I say hey good buddy can I get ya sumpin
How bout a little Gatorade here
Naw that's alright I got plenty a-time

and she leaves her endings, beneath our feet
walk lightly, upon their faces
leave gentle traces, upon their sleep

And this old porch is like a steaming, greasy plate of enchiladas
With lots of cheese and onions
And a guacamole salad

In old downtown
With iced tea and a waitress
And she will smile every time

On the main street of Texas

Of G and R and Xs
With that '62 poster
That's almost faded down
And a screen without a picture
Since Giant came to town
And this old porch is like a weathered, gray-haired
Seventy years of Texas
Who's doing all he can
Not to give in to the city
And he always takes the rent late
So long as I run the cattle
And he picks me up at dinnertime
And I listen to him rattle
He says the Brazos still runs muddy
Just like she's run all along
And there ain't never been no cane to grind
The cotton's all but gone
And you know this brand new Chevrolet
Hell it was something back in '60
But now there won't nobody listen to him
'Cause they all think he's crazy
And this old porch is just a long time
Of waiting and forgetting
And remembering the coming back
And not crying about the leaving
And remembering the falling down
And the laughter of the curse of luck
From all of those passers-by
Who said we'd never get back up

Teasing the ones that they dearly adore

Bonfires blaze to the children's delight

I would stick with a gig that would last us throughout the weekend
I was singing a new song I'd wrote on the way into town
When she came in the front door and found her a place to sit down.
Hey I knew right away that she like the words to my song
Cause she stared at my git guitar and followed my fingers too long
And she had the likeness of a girl I'd seen in my dreams
But lights can do wonders with make up and faded blue jeans.
And the last thing I needed was somebody messin' up my mind
So I found a hundred reasons for lookin' her way one more time
She could cause me to sing bad and fall out of love with guitar
And blow all my chances at bein' a big singing star.
With one passin' glance I could tell she was young for her age
Yeah she got to looking better as she got down closer to the stage
And as she sipped on her wine I knew just the kind she would be
And somehow I knew she was here to the bad things to me.

Higher than the pine trees growin? tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late De-cember
And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of the Whippoorwill
From the backroads to the broadway shows with a million miles between
There's a least a million love songs that people love to sing
And everyone is different and everyone's the same

He could handle a rope and he was good with a gun.

But his hat seemed to me like an old halo.

Then he tied a cord to the end of a mop,
and said, ""Son, here's a pony, keep her at a trot.""

Then I'd flop down beside him.
And he was ninety years old in sixty-three

recall of a little run-down cabin in the woods.
My daddy never promised that our blue moon 
would turn gold but he lay awake nights wishin'
that it would.
When the world was on our radio, hard work was on 
our minds.
We lived our day-to-day in plain dirt fashion.
With old overalls and cotton balls all strapped across 
your back, man, it's hard to make believe ain't nothing 
wrong.
But mama kept the Bible read, and daddy kept our family 
fed and somewhere in between I must have grown.
Cause someday I was dreamin' that a song that I was singin'
takes me down the road to where I want to go.
Now, I know, it's a long, hard road.
Sometimes, I remember when I stay up late at night,
when the sun-up came, we got up and went.
In the shadows of a working day, our moonlight hours 
spent, singin' songs along with grandma's radio.
Now, I'm beatin' down an old blacktop road, sleepin' 
in a sack, livin' in my memories all in vain.
Cause those city lights ain't all that bright, compared 
to what it's like, to see lightning bugs go dancin' in 
the rain.
Mama played the guitar then, and daddy made the saw blade 
bend and raindrops played the tin roof like a drum.
But I just kept on dreamin' that a song that I was singin'
takes me down the road to where my name is known.
Now, I'm gone, and it's a long, hard road.
Yes, I know, it's a long, hard road..

  Over my left shoulder
  I've spent most all my life
  Searching for that four-leafed clover
  Yet you run with me,
  Chasing my rainbows
  Honey I love you, too
  And that's the way love goes.
   That's the way love goes, babe
   That's the music God made
   For all the world to sing
   It's never gets old; it grows
   Losing makes me sorry
   You say, ""Honey, don't worry.""
   Don't you know I love you, too
   And that's the way love goes.
   That's the way love goes, babe

We must be out of our minds.
Though we are shipmates and bound for tomorrow
Everyone here's flying blind.
We must believe in magic.
We must believe in the guiding hand.
If you believe in magic
You'll have the universe at your command.
Mad is the crew bound for Alpha Centauri
Dreamers and poets and clowns.
Bold is the ship bound for Alpha Centauri.
Nothing can turn it around.
Oh, we must believe in magic

With another wide river to cross
Another wide river to cross
With another wide river to cross
And I believe I can make it to the other side 'cause I feel a hand on me
Helping me with another wide river to cross
And I wake up to many a day
With another wide river to cross
With another wide river to cross
Another wide river to cross
I jump right in the dark and I swim right on toward the light on the other side
It's always there when there's another wide river to cross
Oh the whirlpools twist and pull at me
With another wide river to cross
Another wide river to cross
With another wide river to cross
And if I reach up a hand is always reaching down for me
It's always there when there's another wide river to cross
Well the river Jordan is a narrow stream
But it's another wide river to cross
It's another wide river to cross
It's another wide river to cross
But I believe there's a resting place that's provided just for me

And your trying not to scream
And your trying not to tell them
But you don't care what they mean
And your really feeling fragile
And you really can't get home
And you really feel abandoned
But ya wanna be alone
Old friends, they shine like diamonds
Old friends, you can always call
Old friends, Lord, you can't buy'em
Ya know, it's old friends after all
And when the house is empty
And the light begins to fade
And there's nothin' to protect you
Except the window shade
It's hard to put your finger
On the thing that scares ya most
And ya can't tell the difference 
Between an angel and a ghost

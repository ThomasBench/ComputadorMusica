Et je ne sais pas très bien ou j'm'en vais

All the little children of the world.

They are precious in his sight.
Jesus loves the little children of the world.
Everything is beautiful, in its own way.

snow-covered winter's day.
And everybody's beautiful, in their own way.
Under God's heaven, the world's gonna find a way.
There is none so blind, as he who will not see.
We must not close our minds, we must let our 
thoughts be free.
For every hour, that passes by, you know the world 
gets a little bit older.
It's time to realize, that beauty lies, in the 
eyes of the beholder.
Everything is beautiful, in its own way.
Like the starry summer night, or a
snow-covered winter's day.
And everybody's beautiful, in their own way.
Under God's heaven, the world's gonna find a way.
We shouldn't care about the length of his hair,
or the color of his skin.
Don't worry about what shows from without,
but the love that lives within.
And we're gonna get it all together now, everything
gonna work out fine.
Just take a little time to look on the good side, my friend,
And straighten it out in your mind.

snow-covered winter's day.
And everybody's beautiful, in their own way.

""I've seen some sights but, man, you're somethin'""
""Where'd ya come from, country bumpkin?""

Into this wondrous world of many wonders one more wonder came

In a raptured look of love and tenderness
As she marveled at the soft and warm and cuddly boy-child feeding at her breast
And she said ""Hello, country bumpkin""
""Fresh as frost out on the pumpkin""
""I've seen some sights but, babe, you're somethin'""
""Mama loves her country bumpkin""

The heavy hand of time had not erased
The raptured wonder from the woman's face

But she softly smiled and looked into the sad eyes of her husband and her son

""The frost is gone now from on the pumpkin""
""I've seen some sights and life's been somethin'""

Singin' songs and bringin' laughter to the likes of you and me
Cause the world he saw was sadder than the one he hoped to find
But it wasn't near as lonesome as the one he left behind
Yesterday they found him on the floor of his hotel
Reachin' towards the needle,Lord,that drove him down to hell

It was Richmond, Virginia. . . we were bummim’ around,
Suitcase to suitcase. . . we started in talkin‘,
Finding out about the things we've shared in the miles we've been
Well, he had a gray pillowcase full of books by Durrell,
And he had this old concertina, all beat up and she played like hell,
Until you got him started singing those Gospel songs,
Well, he drank all night for nothing, he told his stories till dawn.
And he said, ""Come on, get your bag, boy! Sun's up now and it's time to roll!
Yeah you know there ain't no better time than early in the mornin’
To be out walking down that road!
Just feeling another day beginnin’, whilst all the fools is rushin’ on by,
We'll be like some Mr. Independence: we're taking our own sweet time!""
We walked on out that highway under a clear blue sky,
I was listenin’ to the tales he told, drinking warm red wine.
'Bout a night he rolled seven; bout some girl he'd done wrong;
'Bout everything he could think of while we walked along.
Yeah, ol' Stoney had a magic; made him hard to forget.
Like the night we flew down the highway his old pickup, it nearly wrecked!
With a crazy woman driving, all drunked up and carrying on;
Till Stoney finally calmed her singing those Gospel songs.
Well, we split the road at Norwood, and he just shook my hand.
He said, ""I'll see you some place, friend,"" but you know he never has.
But we were that free then, just walking down the road,
Never really caring where that highway goes.
Yeah, Stoney was a liar and a bullshitter, ain't no doubt about it.
It was just the way he told things, that you never want to doubt him.
'Cause he kept you going when the road got rough,
And brought you through the lean times by making it up.

But I knew she'd never been inside a bar before
And I felt like a peasant who just had met a queen
And she knew I saw right through her tight fittin' jeans
I asked her what's a woman like you doin' here
I see you're used to champagne but I'll buy you a beer
She said you got me figured out, but I'm not what I seem
And for a dance I'll tell you 'bout these tight fittin' jeans
She said I married money, I'm used to wearin' pearls
But I've always dreamed of bein' just a good ole boy's girl
So tonight I left those crystal candle lights to live a dream
And partner there's a tiger in these tight fittin' jeans
We danced every dance and lord the beer that we went through
I'm satisfied I did my best to make her dream come true
As she played out her fantasy before my eyes it seemed
A cowgirl came alive inside those tight fittin' jeans
Well, now she's back in her world and I'm still stuck in mine
But I know I'll always remember the time
A cowboy once had a millionaire's dream
Lord, I loved that lady wearin' tight fittin' jeans

Feeling 'bout as faded as my jeans.
Bobby flagged the diesel down, just before it rained.
 Took us all the way to New Orleans.
Then I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana.
And was blowing sad, while Bobby sang the blues
With the windshield wipers slapping time.
And Bobby's hand in mine we finally:
Sung up every song, that driver knew.
Freedoms just another word, for nothing left to lose.
Nothing ain’t worth nothing but its free, yes it's free.
Feeling good was easy Lord, while Bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me, for me.
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
From the coalmines in Kentucky to the California sun.
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standing right beside Lord, to everything I'd done.
And every night she'd keep me from the cold.
And the one day near Salinas Lord, I let her slip away.
Looking for the home I'll hope she'll find.
And I'd trade all my tomorrows for one single yesterday.
Holding Bobby's body next to mine.
Freedoms just another word, for nothing left to lose.
Nothing ain’t worth nothing but it's free, but it's free.
Feeling good was easy Lord, while Bobby sang the blues
And feeling good was good enough for me.

But we've been through this a hundred times or more.
If I get there 'fore the snow flies,

Show me the jukebox, I'll tell you a song you should play
Sooner a later a few shots of bourbon
And I'll think of somethin to say

Liquor and music, a good combination
If you've got love on the brain
I never knew two women who acted the same
Some want a drink first
And some want to just sit and talk
I'm running and she wants to walk

That's when I asked her
I hope I'm not out of line

The snowbird sings the songs he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers that will bloom again in spring
When I was young my heart was young and true
Anything that it would tell me that’s the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life’s the thing that I can’t win
Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you 
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could, you know that I would fly away with you
The breeze along the river seems to say
That you’ll only break my heart again should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you when you go
To that land of gentle breezes where the peaceful waters flow
Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you 
Where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could, you know that I would fly away with you

Well there's fifty or sixty people
they're just sittin' on their cars,
and the old men left their dominoes
and they come down from the bars.
Everybody's checkin',
old Jack Kittrel(?) checked his watch,
and us kids put our ears
to the rails to hear 'em pop.

was rollin' down the line.
Cuz things got real quiet,
Momma jerked me back,
not before I'd got the chance
to lay a nickel on the track.

Look out there she goes, she's gone,
screamin' straight through Texas

Big, red, and silver,
she's a fast-rollin' streamline
come to show the folks.
Look out here she comes, she's comin'
Look out there she goes, she's gone,
screamin' straight through Texas

...Lord, she never even stopped.
She left fifty or sixty people
still sittin' on their cars,
and they're wonderin' what it's comin' to
and how it got this far.

44,The Gambler,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/the-gambler-chords-2131939,"On a warm summer's evening on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to speak
So we took turns a-starin' out the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us and he began to speak.
He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,
Knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes,
And if you don't mind me sayin', I can see you're out of aces,
And for a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice.""
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow;
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light,
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression,
' said ""If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.
You got to know when to hold 'em, Know when to fold 'em,
Know when to walk away And know when to run.
You never count your money  When you're sittin' at the table;
There'll be time enough for countin' When the dealin's done.
Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
Is knownin' what to throw away and knowin' what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner, and every hand's a loser,
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep."" 
You got to know when to hold 'em, Know when to fold 'em,
Know when to walk away And know when to run.
You never count your money  When you're sittin' at the table;
There'll be time enough for countin' When the dealin's done.
And when he finished speakin', he turned back toward the window,
Crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep,
And somewhere in the darkness, the gambler, he broke even,
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.  
You got to know when to hold 'em, Know when to fold 'em,
Know when to walk away And know when to run.
You never count your money  When you're sittin' at the table;
There'll be time enough for countin' When the dealin's done.

45,City Of New Orleans,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/city-of-new-orleans-chords-556348,"Riding on the City of New Orleans
Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail.
All along the south bound odyssey, the train pulls out of Kenkakee
Rolls along past houses farms and fields
Passing trains that have no name, freight yards of old black men
And graveyards of rusted automobiles.
        Good morning America, how are you?
	Say, don't you know me, I'm your native son.
        I'm a train they call the City of New Orleans
        I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.
Dealing card games with the old men in the club car
Penny a point ain't noone keeping score
Pass the paper bag but hold the bottle
Feel the wheels rumbling 'neath the floor
And the sons of Pullman porters, and the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steel
Mother with her babes asleep, rocking to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel.
Nightime on the City of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Half way home we'll be there by morning
through the Mississippi darkness rolling down to the sea.
and all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rail still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again, the passagers will please refrain
This train got the disappearing railroad blues.
        Good night America, How are you?
        Say, don't you know me, I'm your native son.
        I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
        I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.

46,The Pilgrim Chapter 33,Kris Kristofferson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/kris-kristofferson/the-pilgrim-chapter-33-chords-73413," See him wasted on the sidewalk in his jacket and his jeans,
 Wearin' yesterday's misfortunes like a smile--
 Once he had a future full of money, love, and dreams,
 Which he spent like they was goin' outa style--
 And he keeps right on a'changin' for the better or the worse,
 Searchin' for a shrine he's never found--
 Never knowin' if believin' is a blessin' or a curse,
 Or if the goin' up was worth the comin' down--
 He's a poet, he's a picker--
 He's a prophet, he's a pusher--
 He's a pilgrim and a preacher, and a problem when he's stoned--
 He's a walkin' contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction,
 Takin' ev'ry wrong direction on his lonely way back home.
 He has tasted good and evil in your bedrooms and your bars,
 And he's traded in tomorrow for today--
 Runnin' from his devils, Lord, and reachin' for the stars,
 And losin' all he's loved along the way--
 But if this world keeps right on turnin' for the better or the worse,
 And all he ever gets is older and around--
 From the rockin' of the cradle to the rollin' of the hearse,
 The goin' up was worth the comin' down--
 He's a poet, he's a picker--
 He's a prophet, he's a pusher--
 He's a pilgrim and a preacher, and a problem when he's stoned--
 He's a walkin' contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction,
 Takin' ev'ry wrong direction on his lonely way back home.
     There's a lotta wrong directions on that lonely way back home.

There's nobody nobody knows on the street
A few stranded souls standin' cold at the station
And nowhere to go but to bed and to sleep
Lord would ya look at ya now that you're here ain't ya
Proud of your peers and the long way you've come
All alone all the way on your own who's to say
That you've thrown it away for a song
Boy you've sure come a long way from home
So it's so long but so many so far behind ya
Fair weather friends that you no longer know
You still got the same lonely songs to remind ya
Of someone you seemed to be so long ago
Lord would ya look at ya now that you're here ain't ya
Proud of your peers and the long way you've come

And dance to the tune that our happiness brings
Come go with me to this place I speak of

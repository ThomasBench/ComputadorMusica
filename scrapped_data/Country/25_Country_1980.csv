   Outside another yellow moon
   Has punched a hole in the nighttime
   I climb through the window and down to the street
   I'm shining like a new dime
   The downtown trains are full
   With all those Brooklyn girls
   They try so hard to break out of their little world
   Will I see you tonight        on a downtown train
   Where every night     is just the same;      You leave me lonely now

1,The Clown,Conway Twitty,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/conway-twitty/the-clown-chords-4151494,"  You love the way it makes me feel
  When I can't catch my breath
  Like walkin' on a high wire
  Lord, it scares me half to death
  You're always high above me
  And I'm always fallin' down
  Our love's just a circus, baby
  And I'm just the clown
And I'll do tricks for you
Just like you want me to
I'll do anything it takes
Just to hang   around
I'll paint a smile for you
To cover up my frown
'Cause our love's a circus
And I'm just the clown
  Everyone's in love with you
  But they just look at me and laugh
  And I'll bet when they see me cry
  They think it's just an act
  Ah, but someday   when it's over
  And we bring the big top down
  You can say it was one big circus
  And I was just the clown
And I'll do tricks for you
Just like you want me to
I'll do anything it takes
Just to hang   around
I'll paint a smile for you
To cover up my frown

2,She Only Meant To Use Him,Conway Twitty,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/conway-twitty/she-only-meant-to-use-him-chords-4100656,"She was young and she was pretty
And she met him in the city
And somehow he fit right into her plan
She knew she hit it lucky
He owned half of Kentucky and best of all,
He was a sixty year old man.
She let him think he'd caught her
She led him to the alter
Totin' seven carats on her hand
All dressed up in satin
Aw' the good Lord wasted that one
But she knew she'd be the winner in the end.
'Cause she only meant to use him
She only meant to use him
And she didn't care if what she did was wrong
She only meant to use him
And she knew what she was doing
In a few years she'd be rich and he'd be gone.
In their million dollar palace
The man grew old and jealous
And he never let her leave the house alone
She was in her prime and holding
But she knew that he was old
And chances were he wouldn't be around that long.
As the days and nights grew longer
The greed in her grew stronger
And it even crossed her mind to take his life
But he found out he'd been taken
And his pride was badly shaken
And he knew she never meant to be a wife.
'Cause she only meant to use him
She only meant to use him
But she knew just what she wanted in the end
She only meant to use him
And he knew what she was doing
And he swore she'd never have a dime to spend.
Tormented by frustration
She watched her beauty wasting
As the lines upon her face began to show
She turned to heavy drinkin'
'Cause her ship was slowly sinking
And the bottle was the only place to go.
Now 20 odd years later
The headlines in the paper
Said they laid her soul to rest at 53
And when they wheeled him to her coffin
He took her diamond off
And he just smiled and finally died at 93.
Yes, she only meant to use him
Lord knows she meant to use him
But she died with seven carats on her hand
All dressed in satin
Aw' the good Lord wasted that one
But her husband died a satisfied old man.
Yes she was young and she was pretty
And she met him in the city
And somehow he fit right into her plan
She knew she hit it lucky
He owned half of Kentucky and best of all,
He was a sixty year old man...

So I tell her a lie when I tell her I understand
But inside I die a little each day
Inside I feel her slipping away
Inside if she knew I hurt this way
Inside she'd find a reason to stay
And so I must keep this broken heart down deep inside
She turns to look at me trying to speak her mind
A thousand reasons in search of a single rhyme
And suddenly it occurs to me she's trying to say goodbye
So I give her a smile and tell her that I'll be alright  ooooh

She's the Queen of the Cowboys
Look at ol' Willard grinnin' now boys 
You'd a thought there's less fools in this world (but there wasn't)
Hill country honky tonkin' Rita Ballou
Every beer joint in town has played the fool for you
Backslidin' barrel ridin' Rita Ballou
Ain't a cowboy in Texas would not ride a bull for you
So good luck Willard and here's to ya
And here's to Rita and I hope she'll do ya
Ride all night
Lord I wish I was the fool in your jeans
Hill country honky tonkin' Rita Ballou
Every beer joint in town has played the fool for you
Backslidin' barrel ridin' Rita Ballou
Ain't a cowboy in Texas would not ride a bull for you
Hill country honky tonkin' Rita Ballou
Every beer joint in town has played the fool for you
Backslidin' barrel ridin' Rita Ballou
Ain't a cowboy in Texas would not ride a bull for you

48,She Used To Love Me A Lot,David Allan Coe,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/david-allan-coe/she-used-to-love-me-a-lot-chords-1039938,"	I saw her through the window today
	She was sittin' in the Silver Spoon cafe
	I started to keep going
	But something made me stop
	She used to love me a lot
	She looked lonely and i knew the cure 
	Old memories would win her heart for sure
	I thought i'd walk on in there
	And give it my best shot
	She used to love me a lot
	I sat down beside her and she smiled
	She said where have you been it's been awhile
	She seemed so glad to see me
	Lord,i could read her thoughts
	She used to love me a lot
        She used to love me with a love that wouldn't die
        Looking at her now i can't believe i said good-bye
        It would only take a minute to turn back the clock
        She used to love me a lot
	Well I reminded her how good it was back then
	I said you know it's not to late to start again
	We could spend a night together
	Take up where we left off
	She used to love me a lot
	Then I panicked as she turned to walk away
	As she went out the door i heard her say
	Yes i'm in need of something
	But it's something you ain't got
	But i used to love you a lot
       	She used to love me with a love that wouldn't die
       	Looking at her now i can't believe she said good-bye
       	It would only take a minute to turn back that ol' clock
       	She used to love me a lot
	She used to love me a lot
	She used to love me a lot ...

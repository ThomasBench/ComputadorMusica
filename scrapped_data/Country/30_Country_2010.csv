Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick
The one that makes me scream she said
The one that makes me laugh she said, and threw her arms around my neck
Show me how you do it and I'll promise you I promise that
I'll run away with you,     I'll run away with you
Solo down scale
Solo down scale
Yea spinning on that dizzy edge I kissed her face I kissed her head
and dreamed of all the different ways, I had to make her glow
Why are you so far away she said,  why don't you ever know
that I'm in love with you,    that I'm in love with you
You, soft and only, You, lost and lonely
You, strange as angels
Dancing in the deepest oceans, twisting in the water
You're just like a dream            Solo down scale
You're just like a dream            Solo down scale
Solo up scale
Solo down scale
Daylight licked me into shape, I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name, I opened up my eyes
And found myself alone, alone, alone above the raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved and drowned her deep inside of me
You, soft and only, You, lost and lonely
You, just like heaven
Solo down scale
Solo down scale
Solo up scale
Solo down scale
You, soft and only, You, lost and lonely
You, just like heaven

Walked the cold floor, too
I stood out every window
Dreaded seeing you
Felt the pace of my patience, oh
Wither and blue
And my heart started leaking in my chest like a new found wound
I hope someday that you’re lonely
Oh, lonely like me
I hope someday that you’re filled up
With all the ghosts that you never saw in me
No, my heart couldn’t hold you
I only wish that you’d a let him be
Someday I hope that you’re lonely
Lonely like me

My spine turned to clay
Every second of distance
Seemed a lifetime to me
Though the cold night did claim you
I only wish that I coulda made myself sane
And I dread that moment when your echo finally fades away
I hope someday that you’re lonely
Oh, lonely like me

With all the ghosts that you never saw in me

With your crystal meth

Save your tears for someone else, friend…

Tell my Mother  that I love her…
Give my Brother  my guitar…
Well don’t laugh… this ain’t no f**kin’ joke…
Spread my ashes on the highway
An’ raise ‘em up… an’ take a toke…

Drive real fast… an’ shoot at cops
Sure has been fun… doin’ that…
Take my cash an’ buy some coke…
Do it off some stripper’s ass…
Quit your job an’ hit the road…
See the world an’ have some fun…
Go fishin’ every mornin’…
An’ take in that risin’ sun…

Sleep all day, fUCk the world…
Crank some Hank an’ Johnny Cash…
Buy some bullets, shoot some guns…
Fill’er up an’ burn some gas
Spend what’s left on some good times…

Just spread my ashes on the highway
Because it’s my…  fav'rite…  place…

6,21St Century Blues,Steve Earle,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/steve-earle/21st-century-blues-chords-3427361,"Here I am in the 21st century
I have to say it ain't as cool as I hoped it would be
No man on the moon, nobody on Mars
Where the hell is my flying car?
Ain't nothing even like a teletransporter so far
It's hard times in the new millennium
Getting by on just the bare minimum
Everything to lose and nothing to spare
Going to hell and nobody cares
Ain't the future that Kennedy promised me
In the 21st century
Finally come to the Age of Aquarius
And if we live through the Mayan apocalypse
There'll be pie in the sky above Lemonade Springs
A god-damn American utopian dream
If you believe that, then you're more optimistic than me
Lights out in the heart of America
No love in a time of hysteria
It's head for the hills, every man for himself
Nobody helping out nobody else
Ain't the way that the Maharishi said it would be
In the 21st century
G6  A  x 2
Pray for guidance, beg forgiveness
Vote for change and hope they find this
Only thing I know for sure is
We stand now on the verge of history
The world can be anything that we want it to be
Where there's a will, there's a way, when there's a fire, there's a spark
Out in the streets, downtown in the park
Baby, the future's just waiting on you and me

In the 21st century

Dealin' with the same crowds in the street
Will I ever see
You can find me on the hillside lookin' all around
Or out there by the oak trees on the edges of town
It don't matter where I go
It don't matter what I see
Cuz I ain't ever gonna find the woman for me
She moves just like the springtime
And she's quiet like the voices in the wind
That never end
When she calls me I come runnin'
It don't matter where I am
Cuz I am her man

But the only footprints in the sand are left by me
From the top of the mountain
To the bottom of the sea
Tell me lord where do I find the woman for me
Well I thought I got a hold of her
Back when I was young enough to fall for a crazy girl
But time went by and I found that
I was nothing more than just a boy in a crazy world
And I got dirt on my face and I'm losin' my mind
I been swimmin' through this desert for the longest time

No matter what I see

And your afternoon grows old
And you step outside
To the rain drops glide
And your dog slips out
And you shake the cobwebs free
Is there more to this breath
That you are taking?
When there's a lack of breeze in the huckleberry tree
And the spin out there is that no one really cares
You're the poster child of last decades poster vibe
Is it just a natural conclusion?
Oooh, we'll stand there to connect the-en
 All our powers is merely human
We began as friends in the language of the then
But the comic waves that were looked upon for days
When the path to stray, when I am sure I swear
Is there something in this that is worth singing?
See the roof nearby it was damaged by the sky
And the neighbours to you are no longer-er
There's a chill in the air aforementioned disrepair
All these moments that are to be treasured
Oooh, I never said I had the answer-er
They all live here next to the House of Cancer
On the scale of ten he got the best of both of them
And you collect your shoes from the carpet of abuse
There is a light inside all is bright but just as clean
Is there still something that you didn't mention?
We are building yachts in the former parking lot
For the pride and joy of the recently employed
And you offer things like a chicken or a hymn
Are these pixels of a better picture? wooh
Whoever said you had the answer-er
Living by the ghost of the House of Cancer
Someone scratched the floor as a bug blew in the door
It was dim in soon, how the barks could fill in room
Just the perfect dad and I wish we could pretend
That tomorrow would be all that was waiting
Oooooh lup doo doo doo doo doo
And it was immense and designs that will connect
To the floating power of their offers and our please
With your hands reached out but replies are now delayed
Is there really too much to take with you?
Oooooh lup
A question can be a form of answer-er
Like Jeopardy called in the house Cancer
Da doo doo doop
Covering with bricks the view before our eyes
Still we'll work our best and last for da-a-ays
It's relentless and it spends all your energy to end
In the morning for you still be craving?
Oooooh lup doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
With the paper cup and your dog thats just a pup
People came and went, a position you resent
To reply in kind, oh how could we be so blind?
Is there wonder half the world around you breaking?
Oooooh lup
Colour flights and praise are not your eyes are in
And your smiles in the walls of the House of Cancer
Oooooh lup doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
See the flowers wilt in the government they built
And the hammers wail for the ship that hasn't sailed
We will fall behind of that message over time
Is it written in your constitution?
Oooooh lup
Should we sit and wait, or to never read the flight
And we can watch them wonder what the deal i-is
You go secretly, throw some water on the leaves
It's the best of the day is not been wasted
Oooooh lup
Me either watching or the dancer-er
For living, laughing at the House of Cancer
Oooooh lup doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Call your best shots and that doctor's got a lot
Of ideas that make even children made to wait
There's a line that forms and it's really quite a rush
Can we take the next rush to your demonstration?
Oooooh lup doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
The farmer's cat and your dog that's only black
And your favourite chair, it's the only chair that's there
And you will look out West through the window to the moon
Is there something out there for you to be thinking?
Oooooh lup doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
It's just a guess and not your answer-er
The porch lights just out in the House of Cancer
And the Christmas parade got starting late today
And the smaller pain anyone expected-ed
And the baby's crying and the mothers hands are full
What has happened to the line down at the grocery?
Oooooh lup doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
The mayors alright and she used to strike at the day
For all our cares and there's always so many prayers
By the comments they bring you can hear them echo sing
Where the hell are those Saints a goin, watch him?
Oooooh
It's not a letter to be answered-ered
Park it in the lot of the House of Cancer
Oooooh
Please I beg you do not answer-er
Just board it care of the House of Cancer

Staring at the pictures of the runaways on the wall
Seems like, these days, you couldn't run away at all
Even if you did, what you got to run away to
Just another drunk daddy with a white man's point of view
I can see you in my mind's eye, catching light
Sleep beside the river if we make it out of town tonight
You can strip in Portland from the day you turn sixteen
You got one thing to sell and benzodiazepine
Ten years ago I might have seen you dancing in a different light,
and offered up my help in different ways,
but those were different days
Those were different days
Had a girl back home and we shared her single bed
When I whispered in her ear, she believed every word I said
If she didn't believe, she didn't dare give me slack
Or it was ""Baby, I love you, get off of my goddamn back""
Time went by and I left and I left again
Jesus loves a sinner but the highway loves a sin
My daddy told me, I believe he told me true that:
""The right thing's always the hardest thing to do""
Ten years ago I might have stuck around for another night,
and used her in a thousand different ways,
but those were different days
Those were different days
And the story's only mine to live and die with
The answer's only mine to come across,
but the ghosts that I got scared and I got high with
look a little lost
Ten years ago I might have thought I didn't have the right
To say the things an outlaw wouldn't say,
But those were different days
Those were different days
Those were different days

When it's dark and the sky is pouring acid like a fountain
Memories like coal dust stain the windows of my eyes
So ask them no more questions, they can't sell you no more lies
I hear voices all around me in society's depression
Over and over they all recite their first impression
The rivers are all crying but the ocean cannot speak
Until her waters crash into uncharted shores so dark and bleak
How I wish somebody'd make these voices go away
Seems they're always talking but ain't got much to say
Well a picture's worth a thousand words but a word ain't worth a dime
We all know they'll go on talking 'til the end of time
Don't call it a sign of the times when it's always been this way
Forked tongues and voices behind curtains with no name
They plot their wicked schemes setting fate for all mankind
With evil that can fill God's pretty skies with clouds that burn and blind
How I wish somebody'd make these voices go away
Seems they're always talking but ain't got much to say

Hey I still got a honky-tonk heart
Honey, yeah this is me and I'm a-callin' from work to see
If my sweet little sugar wants to go out dancin' tonight
I've been cooped up in this big high rise
And I'm so glad it's Friday night
I can't wait for the thrill of the music and the neon lights
Hey, I still got a honky-tonk heart
I still drink a beer or two while leanin' on the bar
When I'm steppin' out with you, I'm a two-stepping fool
Hey I still got a honky-tonk heart
Ain't nothin' like a Texas moon
Twin fiddles and an old saloon
And cowboys whirlin' girls around the floor
Yeah we'll be talking all night long
There's no such thing as too much fun
I guarantee we'll be the last ones out the door

When I'm steppin' out with you, I'm a two-stepping fool

Something people kept
Not just something
They would say and then forget
Did families really bow
Their heads to pray
Did daddys really
Never go away

Where friends and family gathered for the Lord
There an old fashioned preacher taught the straight and narrow way
For what few coins the congregation could afford
Dressed in all our Sunday best we sat on pews of solid oak
And I remember how our voices filled the air
How momma sounded like an angel on those high soprano notes
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
Looking back now that little mountain church house
Has become my life's corner stone
It was there in that little mountain church house
I first heard the word I've based my life upon
At the all day Sunday singing and dinner on the ground
Many were the souls that were revived
While my brothers and my sisters who've gone on to glory land
Slept in peace in the maple grove nearby
Looking back now that little mountain church house
Has become my life's corner stone

When in death we sweetly slumber
When the King commands the spirit to be free

Was gonna keep you free and clean  
But now you wear your skin like iron
And your breath's as hard as kerosene 
You weren't your mama's only boy 
But her favorite one, it seems
She began to cry when you said ""good bye"" 
And sank into your dreams
Pancho was a bandit, boys 
His horse was fast as polished steel 
He wore his guns outside his pants 
For all the honest world to feel
Pancho met his match, you know 
On the deserts down in Mex-i-co 
Nobody heard his dyin' words 
Aw, but that's the way it goes
All the federales say 
They could have had him any day 
They only let him slip a-way 
Out of kindness, I suppose
Lefty he can't sing the blues 
All night long like he used to 
The dust that Pancho bit down South 
Ended up in Lefty's mouth
The day they laid old Pancho low 
Lefty split for O-hi-o 
Where he got the bread to go 
There ain't nobody knows
All the federales say 
They could've had him any day 
We only let him slip a-way 
Out of kindness, I suppose
Each of these represent about 1 measure, see the video at 2:48
Poets tell how Pancho fell 
An' Lefty's livin' in cheap hotels 
The desert's quiet and Cleveland's cold 
And so the story ends, we're told 
Pancho needs your prayers, it's true 
But save a few for Lefty, too
He only did what he had to do 
And now he's growin' old
All the federales say 
We could've had him any day 
Only let him go so long
Out of kindness, I suppose
A few gray federales say 
We could have had him any day 
We only let go so long
Out of kindness, I suppose

You can’t make him go he’s too old for that

And a big trip that they took
And I read it in a history book
They rented a car at the Erie Canal
But the car didn't have no brake
Said Ma to Pa ""My God this car""
""Is gonna fall into the Bottomless Lake""
Well, Mama turned to Daddy with a pale face
Said ""I've done something horribly wrong""
And I think I left the kitchen light on""
Then I heard a crash the car when splash
And the compass rolled around and around
Oh, for Heaven's Sake! We fell in a lake
And I think we're all gonna drown
We are falling down
Down to the bottom of a hole in the ground
I'm so scared I can hardly breathe
I may never see my sweetheart again
There was plenty of food in the backseat
And the windows were rolled up tight
Told stories 'way thru' the night
Well, Pa told one that he told before
And the baby got a bellyache
Said Ma to Pa ""My God this car""
""Falling down a Bottomless Lake""
We are falling down
Down to the bottom of a hole in the ground
I'm so scared I can hardly breathe
I may never see my sweetheart again
Poppa played the music on the radio
Mama rocked the baby to sleep
But he didn't think the lake was that deep
Well, if the ferry been there at the end of the pier
We'd be half way to Uncle Jake's
Instead of looking at fish out the window I wish
We'd hit the bottom of the Bottomless Lake
'Stead of looking at fish out the window I wish
We'd hit the bottom of the Bottomless Lake
We are falling down
Down to the bottom of a hole in the ground
I'm so scared I can hardly breathe
I may never see my sweetheart again
So if you're ever goin' on a big trip
Ya better be careful out there
And wear clean underwear
Take along a Bible in the backseat
Read of David and of Solomon
For if you make a mistake in the Bottomless Lake
You may never see your sweetheart again
If you should make a mistake in the Bottomless Lake
You may never see your sweetheart again
If you should make a mistake in the Bottomless Lake
You may never see your sweetheart again

They say that country's middle of the road now
They say they've had enough of all this noise
Our ballads and our stories now enjoyed
When rock 'n' roll came out and just took over
A lot of music just went underground
'Cause country music added to the sound
Oh they're singing songs they've only just discovered
Just hear them talk about their brand new sounds

Concerning a great speckled bird
Remember her name is recorded
On the pages of God's Holy Word.
All the other birds are flocking 'round her
And she is despised by the squad
But the great speckled bird in the Bible
Is one with the great church of God.
All the other churches are against her
They envy her glory and fame
They hate her because she is chosen
And has not denied Jesus' name.
Desiring to lower her standard
They watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teachings
But really they find no mistake.
She is spreading her wings for a journey
She's going to leave by and by
When the trumpet shall sound in the morning
She'll rise and go up in the sky.
In the presence of all her despisers
With a song never uttered before
She will rise and be gone in a moment
Till the great tribulation is o'er.
I am glad I have learned of her meekness
I am proud that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing
The face of my Savior to look.
When He cometh descending from heaven
On the cloud that He writes in His Word
I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him
On the wings of that great speckled bird.

48,I Dont Think Shes In Love Anymore (ver 2),Charley Pride,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/charley-pride/i-dont-think-shes-in-love-anymore-chords-3600578,"Well, I came in late again last night
Really, it was this morning
I had my alibi down pat
I was gonna be charming
But the locks were all changed
I was stuck outside
With a key that no longer fit
There was a note on the door
That said, adios, sayonara
Goodbye, this is it
I don't think she's in love anymore
She's hanging up her telephone
And locking her door
I don't think she wants to
Hear anymore of my lyin'
I don't think she's in love anymore
She's not buying my lies like before
The only thing she wants
Out of me now is goodbye
So I went down to a phone booth
Almost down to crying
All ready to spill the truth
I see she's tired of my lying
Well, I was all ready to beg and plead
And to turn over a brand new leaf
But the second she heard
It was me on the line
I heard click, she hung up on me
I don't think she's in love anymore
She's hanging up her telephone
And locking her door
I don't think she wants to
Hear anymore of my lyin'
I don't think she's in love anymore
She's not buying my lies like before
The only thing she wants
Out of me now is goodbye
I don't think she's in love anymore
She's hanging up her telephone
And locking her door
I don't think she wants to
Hear anymore of my
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't think she's in love anymore
She's not buying my lies like before
The only thing she wants
Out of me now is goodbye

49,That Home Far Away,Doyle Lawson & Quicksilver,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/doyle-lawson-quicksilver/that-home-far-away-chords-3235586,"Oh Lord have mercy on this weary soul of mine
May I walk in your light everyday
And when I’ve crossed that deep silent river
I’ll be happy in that home far away
I wandered away from the straight and the narrow
Driftin’ like a ship lost at sea
No lighthouse to guide my weary footsteps
Till Jesus answered my plea
Oh Lord have mercy on this weary soul of mine
May I walk in your light everyday
And when I’ve crossed that deep silent river
I’ll be happy in that home far away
The lights are bright no longer I’m blinded
From the bondage of sin I’m free
He lifted me up to join salvation
I’ll live on eternally
Oh Lord have mercy on this weary soul of mine
May I walk in your light everyday
And when I’ve crossed that deep silent river
I’ll be happy in that home far away

0,This Side Of The Law,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/this-side-of-the-law-chords-2129377,"On this side of the law, On that side of the law,
Who is right? Who is wrong? Who is for and who?s against the law?
You see, I didn't really mean you no harm,
But I simply couldn't make it on the farm.
When the land won't give a lot You gotta do with what you got.
And all I got's the muscle in my arm;
Well, I wouldn't ever hurt my fellow man.
And Mister seems to me that you could under stand.
I'm just tryin' to help my self without hurtin' somebody else.
And a man has got to do the best he can.
On this side of the law, On that side of the law,
Who is right? Who is wrong?  Who is for and who's against the law?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
Well, I didn't mean to let my fam'ly down,
And I'm not giving you the run a round.
I'd much rather be dead than have to beg my daily bread.
And to pay my way no matter where I'm bound;
Well, I didn't really think that I did wrong.
Just as long I stayed here where I belong.
I did the only thing I could, Same as anybody would.
Yes I was simply trying to get along.
On this side of the law, On that side of the law,
Who is right? Who is wrong?  Who is for and who's against the law?

1,Face Of Despair,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/face-of-despair-chords-3232004,"Fingers callus from the plough wrinkled weather beating brow
Streak of silver in the hair

face of despair
A back that's bent from years of toil
thorns grow in the worn out soil
No one left to really care

face of despair
If you should plough old fields like these you'd plough up memories
Don't tell the young to mend their ways
you can't show them better days
Their better days are yet ahead your better days have long been dead
Rest easy in your rocking chair
mhm and look out at your September country
Face of despair
Shoulders weary from the load
life is rough as a gravel road
How much of it can you bear
mhm look at your September country
face of despair
In the September of your years
eyes that hide a veil of tears
A look of longing always there

And give them all to me,

Naming the sorrows you've seen.
Too many bad times, too many sad times,
And nobody knows what you mean.

Trailing a wandering star.

Nobody knows where you are.

You would lose them, I know how to use them,
Give them all to me.

Seeking a satisfied mind.
Too many highways, too many byways,
And nobody's walking behind.

Give them all to me.

What can we do when there is no love there

And all these things shall be added unto you

To climb every mountain that we face every day
And in time of troubles what to depend upon
To be the truth and help us carry on

Jesus said let not your heart be troubled if you believe in God believe also in me

He was a lover of our town
Wherever he went the girls fell down
And cried for Willie Brown
Crazy about Willie Brown
Tall and dark and lean and long
Big as a bull and twice as strong
He loved the girls and turned them down
A sheik was Willie Brown
Dashing Willie Brown
Well a new girl moved in on our street
We knew that she and Will would meet
But then when we inquired around
She'd not met Willie Brown
She said, ""who's Willie Brown?""
The prettiest girl you ever saw
Head to toe without a flaw
When we met one night in town
She fell for Willie Brown
In love with Willie Brown
But the trouble was that we all knew
Willie Brown was falling too
Then he announced when June comes around
She'll marry Willie Brown
She's in love with Willie Brown
But then the girl denied it all
She said, ""its true that I did fall
But he took my love for granted now
To heck with Willie Brown
Conceited Willie Brown""
Willie Brown was shocked to learn
That his love had at last been spurned
So on a hill outside of town
We buried Willie Brown
We buried Willie Brown

And I got about a dollar laid away
The winds from the south and the fishing's good
Got a pot belly stove and a cord of wood
Mama turns leftovers into hash
So I'm doing alright for country trash
I got a mackinaw and a hunting dog
And a cap that I ordered from the catalog
A big tall tree that shades the yard
A big fat sow for the winter's lard
Let the thunder roll and the lightning flash
I'm doing alright for country trash
Well there's not much new ground left to plow 
And crops need fertilizing now
My hands don't earn me too much gold
For security when I grow old
But we'll all be equal when we're under the grass
And God's got a heaven for country trash
And God's got a heaven for country trash
And I'll be doing alright for country trash

17,Paul Revere,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/paul-revere-chords-3492122,"In April of 1775
this great nation started coming to life.
Old King George didn`t like it one bit,
so he proceeded to throw him a royal fit.
He told his generals : Better     get `em back in line!
Make  `em pay my taxes now, America is mine!
Stop that independence talk before it gets around,
or it`s gonna be hard to hold them rebels down!
    Well, the King was talking `bout the men like Paul Revere,
    and the Minutemen who held their dream of independence dear.
    They kept their eyes on the British, they watched them day and night,
    they knew very soon they`d get their chance to stand and fight.
   Yes, they knew that the British would be moving any hour,
    so they arranged a signal in the Northend church tower.
    Paul was watching when the tower showed a light,
    and he started on his midnight ride.
    He jumped on his horse,     hooves started a humming,
    he screamed out his warning:     Redcoats are comin!
    Better get your guns, and your fighting breeches on,
    they`re comin` and they`re eight hundred strong.
    Next morning at Concord and     Lexington town,
    the spirit of freedom turned the  Redcoats around.
    When we praise the men who made that mighty nation we have here,
   then let`s remember Paul Revere,    yes, let`s remember Paul Revere.
I guarantee you somethin  and I wanna tell you all

34,No Charge,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/no-charge-chords-3479240,"Our little boy came up to his mama in the kitchen this evening while she was fixing supper
And he handed her a piece of paper he'd been writing on
And after wiping her hands on her apron she read it and this is what it said
For mowing the yard 5 dollars, for making my own bed this week 1 dollar
For going to the store 50 cents, for playing with my little brother while you went shopping 25 cents
For taking out the trash 1 dollar, for getting a good report card 5 dollars
And for raking the yard 2 dollars
Total amount owed 14 dollars and 75 cents
Well as mama looked at him standing there expectantly
And I could see the memories flashing through her mind
This is what she wrote and I read it to him
For the nine months she carried you growing inside her no charge
For the nights we sat up with you doctoring you praying for you no charge
For the time and the tears that you've cost through the years there's no charge
When you add it all up the full cost of our love is no charge
For the nights filled with dread and the worries ahead no charge
For advice and for knowledge and the cost of your college no charge
For the toys food and clothes and for wiping your nose there's no charge
When you add it all up the full cost of our love is no charge
Well when I finished reading he had big tears in his eyes
And he looked up at his mother and he said mama I sure do love you
Then he took the pen and in great big letter he wrote Paid In Full
When you add it all up the cost of real love is no charge

When the clay of worthless ground
Is baked into the brick to build
The church that doesn't mind to wait
With patience till it's found
He said children look for me, look for me
Look for me late in the evening
When the honey bear is lost
And hears a buzz of honey bees
That leads him on and feeds him
Till his hunger feels at home
He said children look for me, look for me
Look for me look for me
Love will be there beside you
Love will be there to guide you, look for me
He said help me to help you to help yourself to me
He said children look for love look for me
Look for me there in the hand
That drops a penny in the cup
And in the hand that lends its strength
To help the lonely through the night
And lift the beggar up
He said children look for me, look for me
Look for me there in the chill of dawn
And in the newborn eyes
Of a baby left discarded by
A girl who could offer nothing more
Than a small back alley prayer
He said children look for me, look for me
Look for me look for me
Love will be there beside you
Love will be there to guide you   look for me

Had shattered all his nerves 
And left a little shrapnel in his knee

And gave him all the confidence he   lacked 
With a Purple Heart and a monkey on his  back

When he got that empty feeling 
For a hundred dollar habit without overtime  
And the gold rolled through his veins 
Like a thousand railroad trains 
And eased his mind in the hours that he   chose 
While the kids ran around wearing other peoples' clothes

Climbing walls while sitting in a   chair 
Well he played his last request 
While the room smelled just like death 
With an overdose hovering in the air 
But life had lost its fun 
And there was nothing to be done 
But trade his house that he bought on the G. I.   Bill 
For a flag draped casket on a local heroes' hill 
  There's a   hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes

48,Love Of The Common People,The Everly Brothers,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-everly-brothers/love-of-the-common-people-chords-1800731,"Living on free food tickets, water in the milk 
from the hole in the roof where the rain came 
through..what can you do?..mmm-hmmm-hmmm.
Tears from your little sister, crying cause she 
doesn't have a dress without a patch for the party 
to go..oh, but you know, she'll get by.
Because she's living in the love of the common people.
Smiles from the heart of the family man.
Daddy's gonna buy her a dream to cling to.
Mama's gonna love her just as much as she can, and 
she can.
It's a good thing you don't have bus fare, it would 
it in the snow on the ground..walk into town to find 
a job.
Trying to keep your hands warm, but the hole in your 
shoe let the snow come through and it chills you to 
the bone..boy, you better go home where it's warm.
Where you can live in the love of the common people.
Smiles from the heart of a family man.
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to.
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can, and 
she can.
Living on dreams ain't easy, but the closer the knit 
the tighter the fit and the chills stay away.
I can take them in stride, for family pride.
You know that faith is your foundation and with a whole 
lot of love and a warm conversation, maybe a prayer, 
making you strong..where you belong.
Where you can live in the love of the common people.
Smiles from the heart of a family man.
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to.
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can.
Living in the love of the common people..smiles from 
the heart of the family man.
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to.
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can..(Fade.)

49,Bull Rider,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/bull-rider-chords-2715435,"Well first you got to want to get off bad enough to wanna get on him in the first place
And you better trust in your lady luck
Pray to God that she don't give up on you right now
Live fast, die young bull rider
One hand hold is all you got it's you and the bull against the clock and a cross crowd
And once upon a spinning to nothing else you've ever done can pull this way
You're just outside the bucking shoot
Lose a spur, you lose your seat and you lose yourself
By now he's bucking mean and dirty
Slinging mud and cowboy boots and kicking clowns
No fools, no fun, bull rider
You've got to feel the way he's moving, you've got to watch his head
And brace yourself for anything that a friend of you might dread
You know the art of hanging loose, hanging just as tight
Well there's something like a hurricane who's dancing with the kite
Well, the rodeo is more than rough
It's a fact of life it's tough to cut his fever ass
It's drinking beer and pulling trailers
Tighten may on barreled razors and horse's buck
No rides, no pay, bull rider
Live fast, die young bull rider
bull rider

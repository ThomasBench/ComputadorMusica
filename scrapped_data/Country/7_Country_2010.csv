0,Take This Heart Of Gold,Mandolin Orange,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/mandolin-orange/take-this-heart-of-gold-chords-1898560,"Take this heart of gold and melt it down,
And I'll come around, I'll come around.
I'm treadin' lightly in your eyes
And honey, I can't live a lie
But a life without you could never steal me now.
Well, so much time to spend, why paint this house again,
When the floorboards creak and pull you from your slumbers.
I'd hold you 'til the end,
But honey even oaks must bend
If we intend to stick with one another.
Take this heart of gold and melt it down,
And I'll come around, I'll come around.
I'm treadin' lightly in your eyes
And honey, I can't live a lie
But a life without you could never steal me now.
Out the door and down the drive,
There is a part of me that tries
To keep that highway's call to me away.
And another further still
That sadly never will
Feel at home no matter how long I may stay.
Take this heart of gold and melt it down,
And I'll come around, I'll come around.
I'm treadin' lightly in your eyes
And honey, I can't live a lie
But a life without you could never steal me now.
I said a life without you could never steal me now

1,Talladega (ver 2),Eric Church,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/eric-church/talladega-chords-1467637,"It was the summer before the real world started and,
The deal was we would get to go, if we
Cleaned it up, and got it running,
Daddy's old Winnebago.
Wing and a prayer down 65,
Five best friends on four bald tires,
I can still see Billy smiling
When we finally made it.
To Talladega, boys raised up,
Whiskey in your glass, 
here's to turning up, slowing down 
and cars that go real fast,
We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,
Sure would like to stay in, 
Talladega.
Like a storm, time rolls on,
You can't hit pause as we just did.
Most days in life don't stand out,
But life's about those days that will, like,
Rocking rando, getting rowdy,
Shooting roman candles at the man in the moon,
til the Alabama sun was breaking.
Over Talladega, boys raised up,
Whiskey in your glass, 
here's to turning up, slowing down 
and cars that go real fast,
We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,
Sure would like to stay in, 
Talladega.
When the winds go cold and it blows October,
I think about us shoulder to shoulder,
Like those cars my thoughts roll over and over and over,
In my mind
Tonight i'm in Talladega, boys raised up,
Whiskey in your glass, 
here's to turning up, slowing down 
and cars that go real fast,
We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,
Sure would like to stay in, 
Talladega.

One more here we go again

Tear our t-shirts off each other
Your hands all over me

But one more time is not enough
One last kiss and then you’re a goner

4,Songs That She Sang In The Shower,Jason Isbell,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jason-isbell/songs-that-she-sang-in-the-shower-chords-1426111,"On a lark.  On a whim.
I said there’s two kinds of men in this world and you’re neither of them
And his fist, cut the smoke
I had an eighth of a second to wonder if he got the joke
In the car, headed home
She asked if I had considered the prospect of living alone
With a steak, held to my eye
I had to summon the confidence needed to hear her goodbye
And another brief chapter without any answers blew by
And the songs that she sang in the shower are stuck in my head
Like Bring Out The Dead.      Breakfast In Bed.
And experience robs me of hope that she’ll make it back home
So I’m stuck on my own.      I’m stuck on my own.
In a room, by myself
Looks like I’m here with a guy that I judge worse than anyone else
So I pace, and I pray
And I repeat the mantras that might keep me clean for the day
And the songs that she sang in the shower all ring in my ear
Like Wish You Were Here,     how I wish you were here.
And experience robs me of hope that you’ll ever return
So I breathe and I burn.      I breathe and I burn.
And the church bells are ringing for those who are easy to please
And the frost on the ground prob’ly envies the frost on the trees
And the songs she sang in the shower are stuck in my mind
Like Yesterday’s Wine,       like Yesterday’s Wine
And experience tells me that I’ll never hear them again
Not thinking of then.         Not thinking of then.

I spilled every last drop of time that summer in the sun
    My daddy had a Timex watch
Cigarette in his hand and a mouthful of scotch
Spinnin' me around like a tilt-a-whirl on his arm
Houses need paint, winters bring snow
Kids, come on in before your supper gets cold
Collection plates and daddy's billfold
And that's how it goes
You live long enough, people get old
I sat up right beside him in the cab of that truck
Goin' thirty miles-an-hour down a side road talkin' 'bout the fish we caught
And I'm older now than he was then
If I could go back in time, I would in a second
To his beat-up blue jeans and a t-shirt with the sleeves cut off
Houses need paint, winters bring snow
Kids growin' up and seekin' out the window
Hittin' every small-town dirt road
And that's how it goes
You live long enough, and people get old
Yeah, people get old
      Daddy keeps busy in the aftenoons playin' cards by himself
And he shouldn't be shovelin' that first snow, but you know he won't take the help
Full of pride and love, he don't say too much but hell, he never did
And you still think he's forty-five and he still thinks that you're a kid
One day you'll find yourself sayin' the things that he said
You'll be walkin' down the hallway, turnin' off every light switch
When you twirl your kids in your arms
Before you know it, it won't take too long
They'll be runnin' off makin' a life just like you did
Houses need paint, winters bring snow
Nothin' says ""love"" like a band of gold
Babies grow up and houses get sold
And that's how it goes
Time is a thief, pain is a gift
The past is the past, it is what it is
Every line on your face tells a story somebody knows
That's just how it goes
You live long enough and the people you love... get old

I couldn't see your face, but I prayed for you

Graceful eyes to see me through
A smile that steals me, a heart that heals me
a touch that kills me too

Then you take a poke at the politicians

Race cars on the kitchen floor
Plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
 I remember your blue eyes, looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing, before bedtime 
Then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand
Little man, and even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I, leaned in and whispered to you...
 Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away, from here
You were, my best, four years
 I remember the drive home, when the blind hope 
Turned to crying and screaming ""Why?""
Flowers pile up in the worst way
No one knows what to say, about a beautiful boy who died 
And it's about to be Halloween, you could be anything 
You wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face 
And whispered in your ear...
 Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away, from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray, will just disappear
 Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away, from here
You were, my best, four years
What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
What if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one... moment with you?

Youre like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what theyre runnin from
Was it just too far to fall?
For a little paper doll
Fold a scarf, Moroccan red
And tie your hair behind your head
Strap into some heels that hurt
You shouldve kept my undershirt
Youre like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what theyre runnin from
Was it just too far to fall?
For a little paper doll
Cut the cord and pull some strings
And make yourself some angel wings
And if those angel wings dont fly
Someones gonna paint you another sky
Cause youre like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what theyre runnin from

Give me the road that I may run
Give me that peaceful, wandering free I used to know
I've waited all I can
But I'm just not a patient man
And I've been hiding here for seven months or so
Hand me down my coat and hat
And grab the winter one at that
You never know how long I'll be away
Give me my badge and gun
Give me the songs that I once sung
Give me those jet-black, kick-back, lay down nights alone
This house is safe and warm
But I was made to chase the storm
Taking the whole world on with big ol' empty arms
Tell my friends I tried my best
That one day I just up and left
They probably saw it coming anyway
The lock is on the cellar door
I can't remember what it's for
I ain't been down those stairs in oh so long
So, so long
Give me my badge and gun
Give me the road that I must run
Give me that peaceful, wandering free I used to know
The copy of your key is hanging where it used to be
Good as you've always been to me
The life I need to lead
Is somewhere out there, callin' over those hills

It will only bring us closer to the love we wanna find

Flashing lights and we took a wrong turn and we
Fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me 'cause nothing's as it seems
Spinning out of control
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds
Didn't it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should've slept with one eye open at night
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
            In wonderland
            In wonderland
            In wonderland
            In wonderland
So we went on our way, too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed
But there were strangers watching, whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
Didn't you call my fears with a Cheshire cat smile
Didn't it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
It's all fun a game, 'til somebody loses their mind
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
            In wonderland
            In wonderland
            In wonderland
            In wonderland
I reached for you
But you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else to make you feel like what we had
And in the end in wonderland we both went mad
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it

Every little smile, every single touch
Reminds me just how much it all makes

Wrapped around me late at night
Pillow talk by candle light
Gonna slow this down and make it last

48,Relatively Easy,Jason Isbell,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jason-isbell/relatively-easy-chords-1414155,"Are you having a long day
Everyone you meet rubs you the wrong way
Dirty city streets smell like an ashtray
Morning bells are ringing in your ear
Is your brother on a church kick
Seems like just a different kind of dopesick
Better off to teach a dog a card trick
Than try to have a point and make it clear
You should know, compared to people on a global scale
Our kind has had it relatively easy
And here with you there's always something to look forward to
My angry heart beats relatively easy
I lost a good friend,
At Christmastime when folks go off the deep end
His woman took the kids and he took Klonopin
Enough to kill a man of twice his size 
Not for me to understand
Remember him when he was still a proud man
A vandal's smile, a baseball in his right hand
Nothing but the blue sky in his eyes
Still, compared to those a stones-throw away from you,
Our lives have both been relatively easy
Take a year and make a break there ain't that much at stake
The answers could be relatively easy
Watch that lucky man walk to work again
He may not have a friend left in the world
See him walking home again to sleep alone
I step into a shop to buy a postcard for a girl
I broke the law boys,
shooting out the windows of my loft, boys
When they picked me up, I made a big noise
Everything to blame except my mind
I should say, I keep your picture with me every day
The evenings now are relatively easy
And here with you there's always something to look forward to
My lonely heart beats relatively easy
My lonely heart beats relatively easy

49,Let Me Down Easy (ver 2),Billy Currington,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/billy-currington/let-me-down-easy-chords-1012948,"There's a little moonlight, dancin' on the sand
There's a warm breeze blowin' by the ocean as you're takin' my hand
You need to know, where I'm standin' now
That I'm right on the edge of givin' in to ya
Baby, it's a long way down
If I fall, can ya let me down easy
If I leave my heart with you tonight,
Will you promise me that you're gonna treat it right
I'm barely hangin' on, if I fall, can you let me down easy
The scent of your perfume, floatin' in the air
Lookin' like an angel lyin' on a blanket with a halo of hair
And those lips, look too good to be true
Once I taste that kiss, I know what'll happen
I'll be at the mercy of you
If I fall, can ya let me down easy
If I leave my heart with you tonight,
Will you promise me that you're gonna treat it right
I'm barely hangin' on, so if I fall, can you let me down easy
If I fall, can ya let me down easy
If I leave my heart with you tonight,
Will you promise me girl you're gonna treat it right
I'm barely hangin' on, so if I fall, can you let me down easy
If I fall,              can you let me down easy

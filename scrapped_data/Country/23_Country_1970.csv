If your plans    and your schemes    done fell through
There was a time I was your only one
Now I-I-I-I'm a sad and lonely one
I'm such a lonely one
Was I gay?    Until today
Now you're gone    and we're through
Am I blue?

Tripping in the starlight Lord and I'm feeling down  
Walking in the shadows  sneaking down the side road
Come early morning I'll be there at the edge of town
I was a-thinking  thinking bout a good thing 
Thinking bout a sweet gleam Mmm in my honey's eyes  
And I was a-sinking  feeling kind of lonesome 
But come early morning I'll be home at my honey's side
I have drifted  up across the mountain 
And I have stumbled  down the other side 
And I've been tempted  tried and troubled   
Come early morning I'll be home and satisfied
She give me a little loving  give me a little sunshine 
Make me have a good time Lord when I'm feeling blue  
I couldn't refuse her  well I couldn't misuse her 
Come early morning I'll be home with my honeydew

He said I thought it would be so easy  another one night stand
She seemed so warm and willing  right in the palm of my hand
Now its three months ago last Wednesday  since I woke up in her bed
Lord I think I love her  but it scares me half to death

5,Big Four Poster Bed,Brenda Lee,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/brenda-lee/big-four-poster-bed-chords-1786190,"It was just some boards of rough cut pine 
And a quilt of patchwork cotton
A place to lay your body down 
Was that big four poster bed
Daddy built it out of pine 
Two days before the wedding
They say the neighbors cheered and hollered 
'Til his face got red
And Mama brought the feather pillows 
And some handmade bedding
And they spent their wedding night 
In that big four poster bed
That night they swore that like that bed 
Their love would last forever
And they'd ask no more of life 
Than the simple things they had
So  they planned their future 
As  they lay there close together
And later I was born there 
In that big four poster bed
It was just some boards of rough cut pine 
And a quilt of patchwork cotton
A place to lay your body down 
A place to rest your head
A  field of fluffy mountains 
For a little girl to hide in
Clouds and chasing rainbows 
Was that big four poster bed
I remember, as a child, waking
up on  winter mornings
With the sound of laughing voices 
And the smell of baking bread
And running 'cross that cold wood floor 
Jumping in there with them
And Lord I felt so safe and warm 
In that big four poster bed
The day that daddy died 
He whispered something soft to mama
To this day she's never told 
a soul the words he said
She just smiled through her tears 
And held his hand and nodded
And my daddy looked so much at rest 
In that big four poster bed
It was just some boards of rough cut pine 
And a quilt of patchwork cotton
A place to lay your body down 
A place to rest your head
A  field of fluffy mountains 
For a little girl to hide in
Clouds and chasing rainbows 
Was that big four poster bed
Now time has dried up all the tears 
 Here I stand a woman
Your arms reach out to touch my soul 
  Your sweet words turn my head
 Darling won't you tell me first 
 This will be forever
Before you lead me up the stairs 
To that big four poster bed
'Cause only love has ever touched 
That big four poster bed
Yes it was just some boards of rough cut pine 
And a quilt of patchwork cotton
A place to lay your body down 
A place to rest your head
A  field of fluffy mountains 
For a little girl to hide in
Clouds and chasing rainbows 
Was that big four poster bed

Won`t take up so much yardage

How you and your hens play
While holding a couple in my arms
Another's on the way

And I'm ready to make a deal

Because you've kept it filled

Near a mountain stream that's flowing crystal clear
Where hummingbirds and honeybees feed on Mama's roses
My memories just grow sweeter with the years
Memories of my childhood are as sweet as mountain honey
And as fresh as dew on morning glory vines
I grew up surrounded by the sights and sounds of nature
And they're forever present in my mind
But I'm headed in the wrong direction home
Headed in the wrong direction home
There's no place like home
But I'm headed in the wrong direction home
Teardrops mingled with the summer rain that was a-falling
The day I left my mountain home behind
With a suitcase in my hand and a hope in my heart
I was following a dream I had to find
In that shingled-covered cottage at the foothills of the Smokeys
Waits a family that I'm longing so to see
And mountain streams and fields of green
And rolling hills stay in my dreams
But I'm many, many miles from Tennessee
And still headed in the wrong direction home
Headed in the wrong direction home
But maybe I'll get back before too long
But I'm headed in the wrong direction hooome

I was on my way to Nashville
I just couldn't hardly wait
Till I could sing my songs

Sleepy, hungry, tired and dirty
And on the steps of RCA

To help me get on record

Everyone was all tied up
Either in a conference
Or in the studio
They said that I could leave a tape
But they'd suggest I didn't wait
'Cause everyone was awful busy
Down on Music Row

And ran out to flag down the wind
I'd have to be weird to grow me a beard
Just to see what the rednecks would do
But I'd have to be crazy plumb out of my mind
To fall out of love with you

When silence was all in abounds
Following ants as they crawl across the ground
Been insane on a train but I'm still me again
And the place where I hold you is true
And I know I'm alright cause I'd have to be crazy
To fall out of love with you
And I don’t intend to
But should there come a day
When I say I don’t love you
You can lock me away
I sure would be dingy to live in an envelope
Waiting alone for a stamp
You'd swear I was loco to rub for a genie
While burning my hand on the lamp
And I may not me normal but nobody is
So I'd like to say 'fore I'm through

I see you're used to champagne but I'll buy you a beer 
She said you've got me figured out but I'm not what I seem

We danced every dance and Lord the beer that we went through

As she played out her fantasy before my eyes it seemed 
A cowgirl came alive inside those tight fitting jeans
In my mind she's still a lady that's all I'm gonna say 
I knew that I'd been broken by the time we parted ways 
And I know I held more woman than most eyes have ever seen 
That night I knew a lady wearing tight fitting jeans

for me.

gonna be all right, baby, hold me tight.

Never get rich for to save my soul
And forty-eleven years of loading coal loading coal
Ain't  never  got  aquainted  with a dollor  bill
And I don't ever reckon that I ever will
A dollar ain't made for a fellow I'm told
That scoops up a livin' loading coal
I cussed everything in the mining camp
From my shovel and my pick to my carbide lamp
But I know just as well when I grow old
I'll still be a cussin' but loading coal

One of these days the mines will strike
And I'll sit around starving til I'm finally told
There's a nickel more a ton for loading coal

Can start me crying.

Only six months you see,
The first three months, was all ok,
But the last three is killin' me,
My wife began her hissin', cut down on her kissin',
And then she failed to shine my shoes,
My shirts they came up wrinkled,
And then I took the first year blues.
Well then she started naggin',
With dishes piled up high,
No food upon the table, she said if she was able,
She'd cook something bye and bye,
Then I began to wonder, if I had made a blunder,
When I said I do, she must have read my thinkin',
Her eyes began to blinkin' and that gal broke into.
Well I heard the dishes crashin',
and I began to dashin', Gettin' out of sight,
for right there was my honey,
On who I'd spent my money, turnin' into dynamite,
Then after she'd exploded, her meanness all unloaded,
And things began to simmer down,
I found myself a'bleedin', and very much a'needin',
Of stitches taken all around.
Well then she started cryin', I felt myself a'sighin',
And then I took her in my arms,
I was afraid to scold her, so I just gently told her,
She didn't do a bit of harm,
Now the first six months is over, and I am much the older,
And experienced with a wife,
If I can stand the next six, my friends all say I'll be fixed,
To take it the rest of my life.

Of the countries far over the sea
From whence came our ancestors
To establish this land of the free
There are some folks who still like to travel
To see what they have over there
But when they go look, it's not like the book
And they find there is none to compare
To beautiful, beautiful Texas
Where the beautiful bluebonnets grow
We're proud of our forefathers
Who fought at the Alamo
You can live on the plains or the mountains
Or down where the sea breezes blow
And you're still in beautiful Texas
The most beautiful place that I know
You can travel on beautiful highways
By the city, the village and farm
Or sail above on the skyways
And the beauty below you will charm
White cotton, green pastures, blue rivers
Golden wheat fields and fruit trees that bear
You can look till doomsday and then you will say
That Texas has beauty to spare
Beautiful, beautiful Texas
Where the beautiful bluebonnets grow
We're proud of our forefathers
Who fought at the Alamo
You can live on the plains or the mountains
Or down where the sea breezes blow
And you're still in beautiful Texas
The most beautiful place that I know

I could see Clifton in the canyon below
In Clifton lived Rosey, we danced and we dined
On the money I made in the open pit mine.
I loved my sweet Rosey and she loved me too
There was nothing for Rosey that I wouldn't do
Her hugs and her kisses, they were something divine
Gave me reason for working the open pit mine.
While I was out walkin' with my Rosey one day
We passed a store window with rings on display
I bought those she wanted, how they really did shine
Spent the money I saved from that open pit mine.
Her love would bring heartbreak, that I would soon learn
'Cause she would two-time me when my back was turned
Rosey would go dancin' and drink the red wine
While I worked like a slave in that open pit mine.
One night I caught Rosey on her rendevous
She was huggin' and kissin' with somebody new
It was there that I shot 'em while their arms were entwined
Then I buried her deep in that open pit mine.
I took a look at my future and what did I see
There was nothing but trouble a-waiting for me
But on the sun's next rising I'll be satisfied
Cause they'll find me there sleeping by my sweet Rosie's side.

And she's got a Daddy with a Caddy that'll date 'er

Too young for loving but I'm too old for fooling

I feel like an engineer that can't find the throttle
I'm too small to walk but I'm too big to toddle

Mine are collapsing 
Plant my feet and bitterly breath
Up the time that's passing
Breath I'll give and breath I'll take
And pray the day's not poison
Stand among the ones that live 
In lonely indecision
Fingers walk the darkness down
Mind is on the midnight
Gather up the gold you've found
You fool it's only moonlight
And if you try to take it home
Your hands'll turn to butter
Better leave this dream alone
Try to find another
Salvation sat and crossed herself
And called the devil partner
Wisdom burned upon a shelf
Who'll kill the raging cancer?
Seal the river at its mouth
Take the water prisoner
Fill the sky with screams and cries
Bathe in fiery answers
Jesus was an only son
Love his only concept
Strangers cry in foreign tongues 
And dirty up the doorstep
And I for one and you for two
Ain't got the time for outside
Just keep your injured looks to you
We'll tell the world that we tried

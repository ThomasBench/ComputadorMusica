0,I Feel Like Hank Williams Tonight,Jerry Jeff Walker,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jerry-jeff-walker/i-feel-like-hank-williams-tonight-chords-1415960,"Well, I could live my whole life, without a phone call
The likes of which I got today.
It was only my wife, said hello then goodbye.
And told me she's going away.
Well I didn't cry, It was all cut and dried.
I hung up before I realized.
Turned up my stereo, I walked to the window,
Stared at the storm clouds outside.
And I play classical music when it rains,
I play country when I am in pain.
But I won't play Beethoven, the mood's just not right
 Oh, I feel like Hank Williams tonight.
There's no explanation, not even a reason,
No talk of the good times we had.
Was it me, was it her, I don't know for sure,
And that's why I'm feeling so bad.
Hey, I play jazz when I am confused,
I play country whenever I lose.
Bird's saxophone, it just don't seem right
 Now, I feel like Hank Williams tonight.
Lately I've been thinkin', I just might quit drinkin'.
 Now I don't know all-in-all.
I just might stay home, get drunk all alone,
And punch a few holes in the wall.
But when I'm real high I play rock'n'roll,
I play country when I'm losing control.
I don't play Chuck Berry quite as much as I'd like,
 Now, I feel like Hank Williams tonight.
I feel like Hank Williams tonight.

1,The Legend Of Wooley Swamp,The Charlie Daniels Band,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-charlie-daniels-band/the-legend-of-wooley-swamp-chords-695338,"Well, if you ever go back into Wooley Swamp,
Well, you better not go at night.
There's things out there in the middle of them woods
That make a strong man die from fright.
Things that crawl and things that fly
And things that creep around on the ground.
And they say the ghost of Lucius Clay gets up and he walks around.
But I couldn't believe it.
I just had to find out for myself.
And I couldn't conceive it
'Cause I never would have listened to nobody else.
And I couldn't believe it.
I just had to find out for myself
There's some things in this world you just
can't explain.
The old man lived in the Wooley Swamp way back in Booger Woods.
He never did do a lot of harm in the world, but he never did do no good
 People didn't think too much of him. They all thought he acted funny
The old man didn't care about people anyway, all he cared about was his money.
He'd stuff it all down in mason jars, and he'd bury it all around
And on certain nights, if the moon was right, he'd dig it up out of the ground.
He'd pour it all out on the floor of his shack, and run his fingers through it.
Yeah, Lucius Clay was a greedy old man, and that's all that there was to it.
But I couldn't believe it.
I just had to find out for myself.
And I couldn't conceive it
'Cause I never would have listened to nobody else.
And I couldn't believe it.
I just had to find out for myself
There's some things in this world you just
can't explain.
The Caleb boys was white trash, they lived over on Carver's Creek.
They were mean as a snake, and sneaky as a cat, and belligerent when they'd speak.
One night the oldest brother said, ""Y'all meet me at the Wooley Swamp later
We'll take old Lucius's money, and we'll feed him to the alligators.""
They found the old man out in the back with a shovel in his hand,
Thirteen rusty mason jars was just dug up out of the sand.
And they all went crazy and they beat the old man, and they picked him up off of the ground.
Threw him in the swamp and stood there and laughed as the black water sucked him down.
Then they turned around, and went back to the shack, and picked up the money and ran.
They hadn't gone nowhere when they realized they were running in quicksand.
And they struggled and they screamed but they couldn't get away and just before they went under.
They could hear that old man laughing in a voice as loud as thunder.
And that's been fifty years ago and you can go by there yet.
There's a spot in the yard in the back of that shack where the ground is always wet.
And on summer nights if the moon is right down by the that dark footpath,
You can hear three young men screaming. You can hear one old man laugh.
Well, if you ever go back into Wooley Swamp,
Well, you better not go at night.
There's things out there in the middle of them woods
That make a strong man die from fright.
Things that crawl and things that fly
And things that creep around on the ground.
And they say the ghost of Lucius Clay gets up and he walks around.
But I couldn't believe it.
I just had to find out for myself.
And I couldn't conceive it
'Cause I never would have listened to nobody else.
And I couldn't believe it.
I just had to find out for myself
There's some things in this world you just
can't explain.

She had a reputation as a girl who'd been around
Down Main Street after midnight, a brand new pack of cigs
A fresh one hanging from her lips, a beer between her legs
She'd ride down to the river, meet with all her friends
The road goes on forever and the party never ends
Sonny was a loner, older than the rest
He was goin' in the Navy, but he couldn't pass the test
So he hung around town, sold a little pot
The Law caught wind of Sonny, one day he got caught
He was back in business when they set him free again
The road goes on forever and the party never ends
Sonny's playing eight ball at the joint where Sherry works
When some drunkin' out of towner put his hands up Sherry's skirt
Sonny took his pool cue, lay the drunk out on the floor
Stuck a dollar in her tip jar, and walked on out the door
She's running right beside him, reaching for his hand
The road goes on forever and the party never ends
They jump into his pickup, Sonny jammed her into gear
He looked on over at Sherry and said, ""Let's get on out of here""
The stars were high above them, the moon was in the East
The sun was setting on them when they reached Miami Beach
They got a hotel by the water, a quart of Bombay gin
The road goes on forever and the party never ends
They soon ran out of money, but Sonny knew a man
Who knew some Cuban refugees who dealt in contraband
Sonny met the Cubans at a house just off the route
With a briefcase full of money and a pistol in his boot
The cards were on the table when the Law came bustin' in
The road goes on forever and the party never ends
The Cubans grabbed the goodies, Sonny grabbed the jack
Broke the bathroom window and crawled on out the back
Sherry had drove the pickup through the alley on the side
Where a lawman tackled Sonny and was reading him his rights
Sherry stepped in the alley with a single shot .410
The road goes on forever and the party never ends
They left the lawman lying, they made their getaway
Got back to the hotel just before the break of day
Sonny gave her all the money, and he blew a little kiss
If they ask you how this happened say I forced you into this
She watched as his taillights disappeared around the bend
The road goes on forever and the party never ends
It's Main Street after midnight, just like it was before
Twenty one months later at the local grocery store
Sherry buys a paper, a cold six pack of beer
Headlines read that Sonny's goin' to the chair

When the bankers swarm like locusts out there turning away our yield
   The trains roll by our silos, silver in the rain
They leave our pockets full of nothing but our dreams and the golden grain
   Have you seen the folks in line downtown at the station
  They're all buying their tickets out and talking the great depression
   Our parents had their hard times fifty years ago
When they stood out in these empty fields in dust as deep as snow
    And all this trouble in our fields
If this rain can fall, these wounds can heal
They'll never take our native soil
    But if we sell that new John Deere
And then we'll work these crops with sweat and tears
You'll be the mule I'll be the plow
Come harvest time we'll work it out
There's still a lotta love, here in these troubled fields
There's a book up on the shelf about the dust bowl days
And there's a little bit of you and a little bit of me
In the photos on every page
Now our children live in the city and they rest upon our shoulders
They never want the rain to fall or the weather to get colder
    And all this trouble in our fields
If this rain can fall, these wounds can heal
They'll never take our native soil

And then we'll work these crops with sweat and tears

There's crooked politicians and crime in the street
And I'm madder'n hell and I ain't gonna take it no more.
We tell our kids to just say no 
Then some panty waist judge lets a drug dealer go
Slaps him on the wrist and then he turns him back out on the town.

I'd take a big tall tree and a short piece of rope
I'd hang 'em up high and let 'em swing 'til the sun goes down

I've got twelve guage shotgun waiting on the other side

I don't want to have to fight you but I dern sure will
So if you don't want trouble then you'd better just pass me on by
As far as I'm concerned there ain't no excuse
For the raping and the killing and the child abuse
And I've got a way to put an end to all that mess
Just take them rascals out in the swamp 
Put 'em on their knees and tie 'em to a stump
Let the rattlers and the bugs and the alligators do the rest

        And i was lookin' for a place to get myself out of the cold
        To warm the frozen feelin' that was eatin' at my soul
        And keep the chilly wind off my guitar
        My thirsty wanted whisky,my hungry needed beans
        But it'd been of month of paydays since i've heard that eagle scream
        So with my stomach full of empty and my pockets full of dreams
        I left my pride and stepped inside a bar
        Actually i guess you'd could call it a Tavern...
        Cigarette smoke to the ceiling and sawdust on the floor
        Friendly shadows
        I saw that there was just one old man sittin' at the bar
        And in the mirror i could see him checkin' me and my guitar
        He turned,and said ""Come up here boy,and show us what you are""
        I said ""I'm dry""-and he brought me a beer
        He nodded at my guitar and said ""It's a tough life,ain't it""
        I just looked at him,and he said ""You ain't makin' any money,are you?""
        I said ""You've been readin' my mail"".He just smiled and said ""Let me see your guitar""
        I've got something you want to hear.Then he laid it on me
        If you waste your time of talkin' to the people who don't listen
        To the things that you are sayin',who do you think's gonna hear
        And if you should die explaining how the things that they complain about
        Are things they could be changin' who do you think's gonna care
        There were other lonely singers in a world turned deaf and blind
        Who were crucified for what they tried to show
        And their voice's have been scattered by the swirling winds of time
        Cause the truth remains that no one wants to know
        Well,the old man was a stranger,but i'd heard his song before
        Back when failure had me locked out on the wrong side of the door
        When no one stood behind me but my shadow on the floor
        And lonesome was more than a state of mind
        You see,the devil haunts a hungry man,and if you don't wanna join him
        You got to beat him
        I ain't sayin' i beat the devil but i drank his beer for nothing
        Then i stole his song
        And you still can hear me singin' to the people who don't listen
        To the things that i am sayin',prayin' someones gonna hear
        And i guess i'll die explainig how the things that they complain about
        Are things they could be changin',hopin' someones gonna care
        I was born a lonely singer,and i'm bound to die the same
        But i've got to feed the hunger in my soul
        And if i never have a nickle i won't ever die ashamed

Ain't nothin' I wanna do Lord, so I guess I could get stoned
And let the past paint pictures in my head
And kill a fifth of a thunderbird Lord and try to write a sad, sad song
Tell me baby now why you been gone so long?
Tell me baby why you been gone so long? you've been gone so long now
Tell me baby why you been gone so long?
A wolf is scratching at my door, Lord, Lord And I can hear that lonesome wind moan
Tell me baby now why you've been gone so long?
Tell me baby now why you've been gone so long?

Like it's raining at mine
Do you miss me, like I miss you,
Is it cloudy all the time
Do you tremble when the phone rings
and you think I'm on the line
Is it raining at your house
  like it's raining at mine
Does it thunder and lightnin' even when the sun shines
Is it raining at your house
  like it's raining at mine.
Is it raining at your place
 just like it is over here?
If it is then sweetheart
 like me I know you're scared
I just called you to console you
 like any old friend would do
Is it raining at your house?
 and by the way, I still love you

44,Streets Of London,Tony Rice,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tony-rice/streets-of-london-chords-2983250,"Have you seen the old man, in the closed-down market
Kicking up the papers, with his worn-out shoes?
In his eyes you see no pride, and there loosely at his side
Yesterday's paper, telling yesterday's news
So how can you tell me, that you're mourning
And you say for you that the sun don't shine?
Let me take you by the hand
And lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something, to make you change your mind
Have you seen the old gal, who walks the streets of London
Dirt in her hair, and her clothes in rags?
She's no time for talking, she just keeps right on walking
Carrying her home, in two carrier bags
So how can you tell me, that you're mourning
And you say for you that the sun don't shine?
Let me take you by the hand
And lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something, to make you change your mind
And in the all-night cafe, at a quarter past eleven
Same old man sitting there, on his own
Looking at the world, over the rim of his tea-cup
And each tea lasts an hour, and he wanders home alone
So how can you tell me, that you're mourning
And you say for you that the sun don't shine?
Let me take you by the hand
And lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something, to make you change your mind
And have you seen the old man outside the seamens' mission
Memory fading with the medal-ribbon that he wears
And in the winter city, the rain cries a little pity
For one more forgotten hero, in a world that doesn't care
So how can you tell me, that you're mourning
And you say for you that the sun don't shine?
Let me take you by the hand
And lead you through the streets of London
I'll show you something, to make you change your mind

And no luck, it's true,
But I always get lucky with you.
I've been turned on, and turned down
When the bars close at two,
But I always get lucky with you.
I've had two strikes against me most all of the time
And when it's down to just a phone call, I'm minus a dime.
I've had good days, and bad days,
But when the day is through
I always get lucky with you
Oh, I always get lucky with you.

And they seem to be more into laid back songs
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
Everybody just wants to go back home
I myself have seen my wilder days
And I have seen my name at the top of the page
But I need to find me a friend just to run around
But nobody wants to get high on the town
And all my rowdy friends have settled down
And I think I know what my father meant 
When he sang about a lost highway
And ole George Jones I'm glad to see is finally getting straight
And Waylon's staying at home and loving Jesse more these days
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
And all my rowdy friends have settled down
And the hangovers hurt more than they used to
And cornbread and iced tea took the place of pills and 90 proof
And it seems like none of us do things quite like we used to do
And nobody wants to get high on the town
And all my rowdy friends have settled down
And I think I know what my father meant
When he sang about a lost highway
And Johnny Cash don't act like he did back in '68
And Kris he is a movie star and he moved out to L.A.
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud
And all my rowdy friends have settled down

All of us were down by the banks of the Paint Rock River
I was next in line to be baptized 
At the innocent age of ten 
And I’ll never forget I remember it yet
The taste of that clear pure water
And that preacher’s words still fill my head
And I hear them now and then He said,
Do you wanna go to heaven
And I said yeah just lead me on
Take my hand can you feel that feeling
And I said yeah just lead me on 
It was the hottest day of summer 
And our final high school dance was just about over
When boys turn into men
And I’ll never forget I remember it yet 
The taste of that clear pure water
But the preacher’s words I barely heard 
As sweet Bonnie Lou gave in   she said
Do you wanna go to heaven
And I said yeah just lead me on
Take my hand can you feel that feeling
And I said yeah just lead me on 
It was a lonely night in August
She was sitting at the end of the bar when I saw her
And with a little wine and an little time 
She would be a prize to win
Now I’ll never forget I remember it yet 
The taste of that clear pure water
When she whispered come on in   she said
Do you wanna go to heaven
And I said yeah just lead me on
Take my hand can you feel that feeling
And I said yeah just lead me on 
She said, do you wanna go to heaven
And I said yeah just lead me on
Take my hand can you feel that feeling

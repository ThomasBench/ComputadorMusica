He got lucky stole her back again
She heard he had a Mercury, Lord she's crazy bout a Mercury

Bought herself a Mercury come a-cruisin' home

1,Concrete And Barbed Wire,Lucinda Williams,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lucinda-williams/concrete-and-barbed-wire-chords-1775441,"This wall divides us, on two different sides
But this wall is not real

But he can't seem to break down this wall
With two strong hands he couldn't move it at all

And they're mean lord they're mean
There's a wall between us, but it's not what it seems

Concrete and barbed wire

But he can't spend time with me
If he could get over,  this wall he'd see

We were drinking champagne punch and homemade eggnog
Little sister brought her new boyfriend
He was a Mexican
We didn't know what to think of him until he sang
Feliz Navidad, Feliz Navidad
Brother Ken brought his kids with him
The three from his first wife Lynn
And the two identical twins from his second wife Mary Nell
Of course he brought his new wife Kay
Who talks all about AA
Chain smoking while the stereo plays Noel, Noel
The First Noel
Carve the Turkey
Mix margaritas when the eggnog's gone
Send somebody to the Quickpak Store
We need some ice and an extension chord
A can of bean dip and some Diet Rites
A box of Tampons, some Marlboro Lights
Halelluja everybody say cheese
Merry Christmas from the family
Fran and Rita drove from Harlingen
I can't remember how I'm kin to them
But when they tried to plug their motor home in
They blew our Christmas lights
Cousin David knew just what went wrong
So we all waited out on our front lawn
He threw a breaker and the lights came on
And we sang Silent Night, oh Silent Night, oh Holy Night
Carve the turkey turn the ball game on
Make Bloody Marys
Send somebody to the Stop 'N Go
We need some celery and a can of fake snow
A bag of lemons and some Diet Sprites
A box of Tampons, some Salem Lights
Halelluja, everybody say cheese
Merry Christmas from the Family
Feliz Navidad!

Ain't found nothing better so far
Been called mercenaries and men with no country
Just soldiers in search of a war
We're bound for the border
We're soldiers of fortune
We'll fight for no country
But we'll die for good pay
Under the flag of the greenback dollar
Or the peso down Mexico way
When this war is over, I might go back to Georgia
And settle down quiet somewhere
I'll most likely pack up and head south for Chile
Heard tell there's some trouble down there

Now it's finally time to go
Can't believe how quickly time has flown
Packin' up the bathin' suits
Getting' out the cowboy boots
That's a sign we must be going home
Time just stopped for a little while
We were part of a tiny island
Made a lot of friends we'll keep for life
When we get back home to Texas
And they ask us what we missed most
I'll shrug my shoulders and I'll smile
Early mornings on the long boat dock
Drinkin' coffee as the sun comes up
Lazy days napping in the big deck chair
Late night dancing in the front street bar
Walking home underneath the stars
Man it's like some dream we live down here
Last night we ate conch and lobster,
Mark said it was his favorite dinner
Maybe even the best one of his life,
Dining underneath the stars
Chilean wine and Cuban cigars,
I smiled at him and said you could be right
And he got real quiet, and he said you know,
Hell I worked hard all my life, I made a lot of dough,
I've been everywheres
I don't think it gets any better than down here
I mean the warmth and love of the people here,
no crime, no hate, or fear
I don't think I'm ready
for the world waiting for me back there
One more morning on the long boat dock,
drinking coffee as the sun comes up
Drinking Bilikin beer in the big deck chair,
late night dancin' in a front street bar
Makin' love under the stars,
man it's like some dream we live down here
Walking home underneath the stars,
hearing voices from that empty bar
Man it's like some dream we live done there
We've been here a week or so
Now it's finally time to go
Can't believe how quickly time has flown
Packin' up the bathin' suits
Getting' out the cowboy boots

when grandma passed away
I was a broken hearted little boy
blowin' out that birthday cake
How I cried when the sky let go
with the cold and lonesome rain
momma smiled said, don't be sad child
grandma's watchin' you today
'Cause there's holes in the floor of heaven
and the tears are pouring down
that's how you know she's watchin'
wishin' she could be here now
And sometimes if you're lonely
just remember she can see
there's holes in the floor of heaven
and she's watchin' over you and me
Seasons come and seasons go
nothin' stays the same
I grew up, fell in love
met a girl who took my name
Year by year we made a life
in this sleepy little town
I thought we'd grow old together
Lord I sure do miss her now
But there's holes in the floor of heaven
and the tears are pouring down
that's how I know she's watchin'
wishin' she could be here now
and sometimes when I'm lonely
I remember she can see
there's holes in the floor of heaven
and she's watchin' over you and me

I walk her down the aisle
it's a shame her mom can't be here now
to see her lovely smile
They throw the rice, I catch her eye
as the rain starts comin' down
she takes my hand says, daddy don't be sad
'cause I know momma's watchin' now
And there's holes in the floor of heaven
and the tears are pouring down
that's how you know she's watchin'
wishin' she could be here now

Watchin' the chickens peck the ground
There ain't a whole lot goin' on tonight
In this one horse town
Over yonder comin' up the road
In a beat up Chevy truck
Her boyfriend Tommy is laying on the horn
Splashing through the mud and the muck
Her daddy say's he ain't worth a lick
When it comes to brains
He got the short end of the stick
But Katie's young and man she just don't care
She'd follow Tommy anywhere
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
And even if they have to run away
She's gonna marry that boy someday
Katie and Tommy at the drive in movie
Parked in the very last row
They're to busy holding on to one another
To even care about the show
Later on outside the Tasty Freeze
Tommy slips something on her hand
He says my high school ring will have to do
'Till I can buy a wedding band
Her Daddy's waitin up 'till half past twelve
When they come sneakin' up the walk
He says young lady get on up to your room
While me and junior have a talk
Momma breaks in says don't lose your temper
It wasn't very long ago
You yourself was just a hay seed plow boy
Who didn't have a row to hoe
My daddy said you wasn't worth a lick
When it came to brains you got the short of the stick
But he was wrong and honey you are too
Katie looks at Tommy like I still look at you
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy
What's meant to be will always find a way
She's in love with the boy
She's in love with the boy

I might have known you'd never make a wife
You gave up the only one that ever loved you
And went back to the wild side of life.

To the places where the wine and liquor flows
Where you wait to be anybody's baby
And forget the truest love you'll ever know.

I might have known you'd never make a wife
You gave up the only one that ever loved you
And went back to the wild side of life.

Though I know our love's forever gone,
And it killed my soul and pride dear inside me,
When I saw you in that stranger's arms so long.

You gave up the only one that ever loved you
And went back to the wild side of life.

And dream of kisses you traded for my tears,
And no one will ever know how much I loved you,
And I pray that you'll be happy through the years.

No tropical depression going to steal my sun away

I was sitting at the bar
I'd bought the house a double
and the waitress, a new car
Dwight Yoakam's in the corner
trying to catch my eye
Lyle Lovett's right beside me
with his hand upon my thigh
The moral of this story,
it's simple but it's true
Hey the stars might lie
but the numbers never do
I feel lucky, oh, oh, oh
I feel lucky, yeah
Hey Dwight, hey Lyle, boys, you don't have to fight
 Hot dog, I'm feeling lucky tonight
I feel lucky, brrrrrrrrrr,
I feel lucky, yeah
Think I'll flip a coin, I'm a winner either way
Mmm, I feel lucky today

 That'll be so hard to do
Cause living ain't worth livin without you
 Cause today my world slipped away
 We buried the plans that we made
 And tonight I'm alone and afraid
 Cause today my world slipped Away

Loretta's singing on the radio
Smell of coffee eggs and bacon
Car wheels on a gravel road
Pull back the curtains and look outside
Somebody somewhere I don't know
Come on now child we're gonna go for a ride
Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel road      
Can't find a damn thing in this place
Nothing's where I left it before
Set of keys and a dusty suitcase
Car wheels on a gravel road
There goes the screen door slamming shut
You better do what you're told
When I get back this place better be picked-up
Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel road      
Low hum of voices in the front seat
Stories nobody knows
Got folks in Jackson we're going to meet
Car wheels on a gravel road
Cotton fields stretching miles and miles
Hank's voice on the radio
Telephone poles trees and wires fly by
Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel road      
Broken down shacks engine parts
Could tell a lie but my heart would know
Listen to the dogs barkin in the yard
Car wheels on a gravel road
Child in the backseat about four or five years
Lookin out the window
Little bit of dirt mixed with tears
Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel road
Car wheels on a gravel road

 The last man on Earth
 Gave him everything she ever had
 He'd break her spirit down
 Then come loving up on her
 Give a little, then take it back
 She'd tell him about her dreams
 He'd just shoot 'em down
 Lord he loved to make her cry
""You're crazy for believing
 You'll ever leave the ground""
 He said, ""Only angels know how to fly""
 And with a broken wing
 She still sings
 She keeps an eye on the sky
 With a broken wing
 She carries her dreams
 Man, you ought to see her fly
 One Sunday morning
 She didn't go to church
 He wondered why she didn't leave
 He went up to the bedroom
 Found a note by the window
 With the curtains blowin' in the breeze
 And with a broken wing
 She still sings
 She keeps an eye on the sky
 With a broken wing
 She carries her dreams
 Man, you ought to see her fly
 With a broken wing
 She carries her dreams
 Man, you ought to see her
Flyyyyyyyyyyyyy

 When all of my hopes were dying
 Her love kept me trying
 She does her best to hide
 The pain that she's been through
 When she cries at night
 And she doesn't think that I can hear her
 She tries to hide
 All the fear she feels inside
 So I pray this time
 I can be the man that she deserves
 'Cos I die a little each time
 She's always been there for me
 Whenever I've fallen
 When nobody else believes
 She'll be there by my side
 I don't know how she takes it
 Just once, I'd like to make it
 Then there'll be tears of joy
 That fill her lovin' eyes
 When she cries at night
 And she doesn't think that I can hear her
 She tries to hide
 All the fear she feels inside
 So I pray this time
 I can be the man that she deserves
 'Cos I die a little each time

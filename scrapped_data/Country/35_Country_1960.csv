My friends all say what a pity
That you've been gone so long
Wonder how you are in the city
Ho'ho my baby, won't you please come home? (come home)
The cotton and the corn, have been gathered
The green, green pastures are gone
Today looks like stormy weather
Ho'ho my baby, won't you please come home? (come home)

The whippoorwills have sta-arted callin'
The night's winds whisper a song
Soon my tears will be fallin'
Ho'ho my baby, won't you please come home? (come home)
Soon the snow will be fallin'
Down comes teardrops and moan
I miss the sound of you callin'
Ho'ho my baby, won't you please come home? (come home)

I must admit, you don't look, so pretty good
What made you say the things you said, to your darlin', last night?
I bet you'll change, the things you said, if you could
Good mornin' self, how do you feel, now that she's gone?
And we just stand here, you and me, all alone
With nothing in this world, but lonely, loneliness
Although I cried, your eyes are dry, good mornin' Jim
Now don't try, to pretend, you don't remember
No need to lie, about the way, you treated her, o'oh no
Just remember, I was there, when it happened
And I heard, those things you said, as she left
You're the only one to blame, but we both must, share the pain
You know it's true, she said we're through, good mornin' self

But nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round
Well on his way, his head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him, or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round
And nobody seems to like him, they can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round
He never listens to them, he knows that they're the fool
And they don't like him, but the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning round

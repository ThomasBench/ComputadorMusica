I can see the bright lights as they gleam
And somewhere you're dancing in some dingy barroom
And the lure of the gayness takes the place of our dream
High on a hilltop my heart cries oh Lord
Forgive her she knows not the way
And give me the power to believe that someday
High on a hilltop together we'll pray
I can vision a rounder with a line so smooth
And a promise of riches for you
But you see not the danger cause you're silly with booze
And from high on a hilltop I see the devil win you
High on a hilltop my heart cries oh Lord
Forgive her she knows not the way
And give me the power to believe that someday
High on a hilltop together we'll pray

We've stood and we've cried as we helplessly watched
A hailstorm a-beating our crops to the ground
And I've gone to bed hungry many nights as a lad
In the good old days when times were bad
I've seen Daddy's hands break open and bleed
And I've seen him work till he's stiff as a board
I've seen Mama lay and suffer in sickness
In need of a doctor we couldn't afford
Anything at all was more than we had
In the good old days when times were bad
No amount of money could buy from me
The memories that I have of them
No amount of money could pay me
To go back and live through it again
We've got up before and found ice on the floor
Where the wind blew snow through the cracks in the wall
And I've walked many miles to an old country school
With my lunch in the bib of my overalls
Anything at all was more than we had

And asked if she'd be true and kind

When I was forced to go aw-ay
In silence there my head she'd rest
And pressed me to her loving breast

There's other girls as good as m-e

Pray don't go where the bullets fly
The deep deep sea may us divide
And I may be some other's bri-de
But still my thoughts will sometimes stray
To thee when thou art far away
I never have proved false to thee
The heart I gave was true as th-ine
But you have proved untrue to me
I can no longer call thee mine
Then fare thee well I'd rather make
My home upon some icy la-ke
Where the southern sun refuse to shine
Then to trust a love so false as thine

And as its beauty struck the darkness from the

all my troubles seem to be
and how lucky another day belongs to me.
And as the sleepy world around me woke up to
greet the day,
All its silent beauty seemed to say,
“So what my friend, if all your dreams you
haven't realized?
Just look around you boy, you got a whole new
day to try.”
Today is mine. Today is mine, to do with what I
will.
Today is mine, my own special cup to fill.
To die a little, that I might learn to live. To
take from life, that I might learn to give.
Today is mine.
Like most men, I cursed the present, void of
peace of mind
and race my thoughts beyond tomorrow envision
there a better time.
But as I view this day around me, I can see the
For today's the only garden we can tend

old enough to fight for his country and its way of life.
Sues' letters came every day..strengthened his cause, 
they showed him the way, to fight for his country and 
the girl he loved..that's a soldier's only pay.
But then Billy heard no more from Sue, he was worried 
sick, but what could he do?
The bullets were screaming as he hugged the ground,
and back home..Sue was runnin' round.
Billy was gettin' less and less strong, his hope, his fate, 
was almost gone.
And then like a miracle a letter appeared..Billy tore the 
letter open and he read, Dear John.
A look came over Billy that would scare a ghost..a familiar 
look seen on soldiers coast to coast.
And even though the air was filled with lead, Billy jumped 
up..they shot him dead.
Billy was buried in a far away grave, it read, for his country, 
his life he gave.
But that epitaph was only in part..he didn't die from a bullet, 
but he died, from a broken heart.

0,Misguided Angel (verÂ 2),Cowboy Junkies,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/cowboy-junkies/misguided-angel-chords-1799035,"Yeah I said ""Momma he's crazy and he scares me
But I want him by my side
Though he's wild and he's bad and sometimes just plain mad
I need him to keep me satisfied""
I said ""Papa don't cry cause it's alright
And I see you in some of his ways
Though he might not give me the life that you wanted
I'll love him the rest of my days""
Misguided angel hangin over me
Heart like a Gabriel, pure and white as ivory
Soul like a Lucifer, black and cold like a piece of lead
Misguided angel, love you till I'm dead
I said ""Brother speak to me of passion
You said never to settle for nothin less
Well it's in the way that he walks, it's in the way that he talks
His smile, his anger, and his kisses""
Yeah I said ""Sister don't you understand?
He's all I ever wanted in a man
I'm tired of sittin round the t.v. every night
Hoping I'm finding a Mister Right""
Misguided angel hangin over me
Heart like a Gabriel, pure and white as ivory
Soul like a Lucifer, black and cold like a piece of lead
Misguided angel, love you till I'm dead
He says ""Baby don't listen to what they say
There comes a time when you'll have to break away""
He says ""Baby there are things we all cling to all our lives
It's time to let them go and become my wife""
Misguided angel hangin over me
Heart like a Gabriel, pure and white as ivory
Soul like a Lucifer, black and cold like a piece of lead

He sounds to blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low

When time keeps crawling by
The moon has gone behind the clouds
To hide his face and cry
Have you ever seen a robin weep
When leaves have turned to brown
Like me he's lost his will to live

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple haze
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry

2,200 More Miles,Cowboy Junkies,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/cowboy-junkies/200-more-miles-chords-1099744,"Atlanta's a distant memory
Montgomery a recent blur
And Tulsa burns on the desert floor 
Like a signal fire
I got Willie on the radio
A dozen things on my mind
And number one is fleshing out
These dreams of mine
I've got 200 more miles of rain asphalt and light
Before I sleep
But there'll be no warm sheets or welcoming arms
To fall into tonight
Nashville there is a lighter in a case for all to see
It speaks of dreams and heartaches left unsung
And in the corner stands a guitar 
And lonesome words scrawled in a drunken hand
I'm travelling paths travelled hard before
And I'm beginning to understand
They say that I am crazy
My life wasting on this road
That time will find my dreams
Scattered dead and cold
But I heard there is a light
Drawing me to reach an end
And when I reach there, I'll turn back
And you and I can begin again

A cigarette drowns inside a glass of gin
He lies there drunk, but it don't matter drunk or sober
He'll never read the words that pride won't let her send

9,To Beat The Devil (verÂ 2),Kris Kristofferson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/kris-kristofferson/to-beat-the-devil-chords-1675803," It was winter time in Nashville, down on music city row
 And I was lookin' for a place to get myself out of the cold
 To warm the frozen feelin' that was eatin' at my soul
 And keep the chilly wind off my guitar
 My thirsty wanted whisky, my hungry needed beans
 But it'd been of month of paydays since I've heard that eagle scream
 So with my stomach full of empty and a pocket full of dreams
 I left my pride and stepped inside a bar
 Actually I guess you could call it a Tavern
 Cigarette smoke to the ceiling and sawdust on the floor
 Friendly shadows
  I saw that there was just one old man sittin' at the bar
  And in the mirror I could see him checkin' me and my guitar
  He turned and said ""Come up here boy and show us what you are""
  I said ""I'm dry"" and he brought me a beer
 He nodded at my guitar and said ""It's a tough life, ain't it""
 I just looked at him, and he said ""You ain't makin' any money, are ya?""
 I said ""You've been readin' my mail"". He just smiled and said 
 Let me see your guitar, I've got something you want to hear.
If you waste your time a talkin' to the people who don't listen
To the things that you are sayin', who do you think's gonna hear
And if you should die explaining how the things that they complain about
Are things they could be changin' who do you think's gonna care
There were other lonely singers in a world turned deaf and blind
Who were crucified for what they tried to show
And their voices have been scattered by the swirling winds of time
Cause the truth remains that no one wants to know
 Well, the old man was a stranger, but I'd heard his song before
 Back when failure had me locked out on the wrong side of the door
 When no one stood behind me but my shadow on the floor
 And lonesome was more than a state of mind
 You see, the devil haunts a hungry man
 If you don't wanna join him you got to beat him
 I ain't sayin' I beat the devil   but I drank his beer for nothing
     Then I stole his song
And you still can hear me singin' to the people who don't listen
To the things that I am sayin' prayin' someoneâs gonna hear
And I guess I'll die explaining how the things that they complain about
Are things they could be changin' hopin' someoneâs gonna care
I was born a lowly singer, and I'm bound to die the same
But I've got to feed the hunger in my soul
And if I never have a nickel I won't ever die ashamed
Cause I don't believe that no one wants to know

Wise men saw a sign  And set out 'cross the sand
Songs of praise to sing They travelled day and night
Precious gifts to bring           Guided by the light.
They chased a brand new star Ever towards the west
Across the mountains far  But when it came to rest
They scarce believed their eyes   They'd come so many miles
The miracle they prized           Was nothing but a child
Nothing but a child               Could wash those tears away
Or guide a weary world            Into the light of day
Nothing but a child               Could help erase those miles
So once again we all              Can be children for a while.
Now all around the world       In every little town
Every day is heard      A precious little sound
And every mother kind          And every father, proud
Looks down in awe to find     Another chance allowed
Nothing but a child               Could wash those tears away
Or guide a weary world            Into the light of day
Nothing but a child               Could help erase those miles
So once again we all              Can be children for a while.

And the moon along the Gunnison don't rise
Shall I cast my dreams upon your love babe
And lie beneath the laughter of your eyes
It's snowin' on Raton, come morning

Ah Mother thinks the road is long and lonely
Little brother thinks the road is straight and fine
Well little darling thinks the road is soft and lovely
I'm thankful that old road's a friend of mine

Well you cannot turn the circles of the sun
Well you cannot count the miles until you feel them
And you cannot hold a lover that is gone

Well, tomorrow the mountains will be sleeping
Silent beneath a blanket green and blue
Ah that I shall hear the silence they are keeping
I'll bring all their promises to you

A place I didn't want to be,
So long ago, I made a decision
To be footloose and fancy-free.
But you came and I was so tempted,
To gamble on love just one time,
I never thought, I would get caught,
It seemed like the perfect crime.
Baby you left me defenseless,
I've only got one plea,
Lock me away, inside of your love,
And throw away the key.
I'm guilty,
Of love in the first degree.
I thought it would be so simple,
Like a thousand times before,
I'd take what I wanted, and just walk away,
But I never made it to the door.
Now babe I'm not begging for mercy,
Go ahead and throw the book at me,
If loving you's a crime, I know that I'm
As guilty as a man can be.

Of the clicking of the turnstile and the rattle of his chains

The race on the highway, the curve nobody seen.
Now you're ridin' in a long black limousine.
When you left home you told me someday you'd be returnin'
In a fancy car for all the world to see.
Now everybody's watchin', so I guess you got your dream.
Cause you're ridin' in a long black limousine.
Through tears I watched you ride by
With a cheauffer at the wheel dressed up so fine.
I'll never love another.  My heart and all my dreams
Ride with you in that long black limousine.
I'll never love another.  My heart and all my dreams
Ride with you in that long black limousine.

Church on Sunday, learn the golden rule
Well the Devil he might get you before he gets through
Might get you before he gets through
Small Town Hero, baseball team
Loud mouth know-it-all, never says a thing
Tries to get some lovin' with his high school ring
Tries to get it with his high school ring
He's always talkin' 'bout
The things he's gonna do
Goes round breakin' little guys in two
Somebody bound to get him before he gets through
Bound to get him before he gets through
Cheerleaders, cheerleaders, yell yell yell
Rah rah rah, you got nothing to tell
Always in your seat before they ring that bell
Well, that bell it don't ring no more
Mommy, mommy, what went wrong?
Too late for questions now, you're on your own
Mommy's broke down and your daddy's gone
They just couldn't make it work no more.

And so I headed out west to see some old friends of mine
I thought if I'd climb up  old Ajax Mountain
Maybe that would help me  get it all off my mind
I made it up to the top picked out a clear spot
I thought a whole lot about the rest of my life
I had no idea then  soon it would nearly end
Up on this mountainside I would nearly die
And they're a--ll in Alabama and they're a--ll in Dixieland
God I'm dy--ing here in Montana please Lord
I just want to go back to hold her hand
Just let me get back to my old homeland
They said I'd never sing again I learned a lot about my friends
When you're shot down and out you don't get many calls
But I saw some tears in some eyes soon my poor old mother would die
I nearly lost it all when I lost my grandpa
But you can find us a--ll in Alabama yeah we're a--ll down in Dixieland
I didn't d--ie out in Montana no Lord
You let me get back to my old homeland
And I'm gonna hold on to her hand
I've done a whole lot of searching a whole lot of hurting
Before I finally found my road in life
You gotta say things you wanna say go on and do things your own way
You can climb any old mountain once you make up your mind
I made m--ine in Alabama and I found m--ine down in Dixieland
I didn't d--ie out in Montana no Lord
You let me get back to my old homeland
And I'm gonna hold on to her hand

When an old friend I happened to see
I introduced her to my loved one and while they were waltzin'
My friend stole my sweetheart from me
I remember that night and the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Yes I lost my little darlin' the night they were playin'
That beautiful Tennessee Waltz

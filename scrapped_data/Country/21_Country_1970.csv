0,Behind Closed Doors (ver 2),Charlie Rich,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/charlie-rich/behind-closed-doors-chords-1039549,"My baby makes me proud
Lord, don't she make me proud 
She never makes a scene 
By hangin' all over me in crowd 
Cause people like to talk 
Lord, how they love to talk 
But when they turn out the lights 
I know she'll be leavin' with me 
And when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down 
And she makes me glad that I'm a man  
Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors        
My baby makes me smile
Lord, don't she make me smile 
She's never far away or too tired to say   I want you 
She's always a lady, just like a lady should be  
But when they turn out the lights 
She's still a baby to me 
And when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down 
And she makes me glad that I'm a man  
Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors

But sometimes lord she just ain't always around
And you know that's when I fall I can't help myself at all
And I get whiskey bent and hell bound
Play me some songs about a rambling man put a cold one in my hand 
Cause you know I love to hear those guitar sounds
Don't you play I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry 
Cause I'll get all balled up inside
And I'll get whiskey bent and hell bound
Sure enough about closing time I'm stoned out of my mind
And I end up with some honky tonk special I found
Just as sure as the morning sun come thinking of my sweet girl at home
And I need to get whiskey bent and hell bound
Play me some songs about a rambling man put old Jim Beam in my hand
Cause you know I still love to get drunk and hear country sounds
But don't you play Your Cheating Heart cause that'll tear me all apart
I'll get whiskey bent and hell bound
Yeah old Hank's songs always make me feel low down

Far away over the sea
Those far away places with the strange-sounding names
Are callin', callin' me.
Goin' to China, or maybe Siam
I want to see for myself
Those far away places I've been reading about
In a book that I took from the shelf.
I start gettin' restless whenever I hear
the whistle of a train.
I pray for the day I can get underway
And look for those castles in Spain.
They call me a dreamer, well maybe I am
But I know that I'm yearnin' to see
Those far away places with the strange-sounding names
That are callin', callin' me.

Is not in this bar where I'm sitting
Where the one that I'm married to is knitting
Feeling it go to my head
But it ain't back at home where she's putting in curlers
And rollers and dressing for bed
The blonde in the corner who's winking
Who's devoted her life to dumb thinking
And somewhere it's waiting for me
And I know that it must be somewhere
Between lust and sitting home watching TV
Somewhere between Playboy magazine
And next Tuesday night's PTA
Somewhere between a honky tonk queen
And what all the dog did today
If a wife and a lover could be one and the same
What a beautiful world this would be
And there would be us somewhere between lust
And sitting home watching TV
But a man can't exist just on bread
Is the one thing that I ain't being fed
Walking through town tempting me
And a body could rust on a diet of lust
And sitting home watching TV
Somewhere between Playboy magazine
And next Tuesday night's PTA
Somewhere between a honky tonk queen
And what all the dog did today
If a wife and a lover could be one and the same
What a beautiful world this would be

5,Calgary Snow,Bobby Bare,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bobby-bare/calgary-snow-chords-1713931,"Last Friday she said to me, hey Billy Joe, did you know either me or the rodeo goes?
so I packed up and left her in Waco and drove up to ride on the bulls in the Calgary snow
saw a sign that said riders and hauled all my rigging inside
where the fellas was braggin', and drawing stock we would ride
I was doin' the same till I looked at the name that I'd drawn
then I stood there and silently cried
oh you Calgary snow
I can't let the rodeo go
hurtin' more than my pride on a bull I can't ride
lays me low, in the Calgary snow
well, I knew I was beat in the hat when I drew it
and it started me drinkin', to think of the brute
till I managed to wreck my left knee and my ankle between the damn bull and the side of the chute
and I'm thinkin' out loud as I fly through the clouds to the ground
hey Billy, maybe you aint' the most dynamite rider around
cause you're kickin' too late comin' out of the gate boy but you're great comin' gracefully down
well, I know that I'm blown in the chute on the first go round
so I give 'em my ole ""what the hell"" grin as I get up off the ground
and right then I'm thinkin' I ain't taken to Calgary much
ain't nothin' back in my room but a broom I can use for a crutch
And it's cold, lord, it's cold in the Calgary wind
when you knowin' that you gotta ride the day morning again
ain't no whiskey nor either nor platens nor pills
gonna deaden the pain and chills
of the Calgary wind
but what more is a broken down rodeo cowboy to do?
but stove up in Canada watchin' his bruises turn blue
there's only one road gonna lead back to Waco and you
and it runs out of chute number two
oh you Calgary snow
I can't let that rodeo go
hurtin' more than my pride on a bull I can't ride
lays me low in the Calgary snow

6,Cowboy And The Poet Faster Horses,Bobby Bare,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bobby-bare/cowboy-and-the-poet-faster-horses-chords-1942131,"He was an old time cowboy don't you understand
His eyes were sharp as razor blades his face was leather tan
His toes were pointed inward from a hangin' on a horse
He was an old philosopher of course
He was so thin I swear you could have used him for a whip
He had to drink a beer to keep his breeches on his hips
I knew I had to ask him about the mysteries of life
He spit between his boots and he replied
Faster horses younger women older whiskey more money
He smiled and all his teeth were covered with tobacco stains
He said it don't do men no good to pray for peace and rain
Peace and rain is just a way to say prosperity
And buffalo chips is all it means to me
So I told him I was a poet I was looking for the truth
I do not care for horses whiskey women or the loot
I said I was a writer and my soul was all on fire
He looked at me and said you are a liar
Faster horses younger women older whiskey more money
Well I was disillusioned if I say the least
I grabbed him by the collar and I jerked him to his feet
And there was somethin' cold and shiny laying by my head
So I started to believe the things he said
Well my poet days are over and I'm back to being me
As I enjoy the peace and comfort of reality
If my boy ever asks me what it is that I have learned
I think that I will readily affirm
Son it's faster horses younger women older whiskey more money
Faster horses younger women older whiskey more money
Faster horses younger women older whiskey more money

weeks gone and he thought he'd stop, at Webb's and 
have him a drink before he went home to her.
Andy Wardlow said, Jed, hello, and he said, hi, what's
doin', Woz?
He said, sit down, I got some bad news, it's gonna hurt.
He said, I'm your best friend and you know that's right,
but your young bride ain't home tonight..since you been 
gone she's been seein' that aimless boy, Seth.
Well, he got mad and he saw red, and Andy said, boy, 
don'tcha lose your head, cause to tell you the truth, I 
been with her myself.
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia.
That's the night that they hung an innocent man.
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer.
Cause the judge in the town's got blood stains on his hands.
Well, Andy got scared and left the bar and went walkin' on 
home cause he didn't live far.
You see, Andy didn't have many friends and he'd just lost 
him one.
And brother thought his wife must'a left town, so he went home 
and finally found the only thing Papa had left him, and that was 
a gun.
And he went off to Andy's house, slippin' through the backwoods 
quiet as a mouse..came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make.
He looked through the screen at the back-porch door, and he saw 
Andy lyin' on the floor in a puddle of blood and he started to shake.
Well, the Georgia Patrol was makin' their rounds, so he fired a shot 
just to flag 'em down, and a big bellied sheriff grabbed his gun and

And the reason he wrote her this song

And for years I would see them go by
And their love that was more than the clothes that they wore
Could be seen in the gleam in their eyes
As a kid they would take me for candy
And I'd love to go tagging along
We'd hold hands while we walked to the corner
And the old man would sing her this song
I'll give you a daisy a day dear
I'll give you a daisy a day
I'll love you until the rivers run still
And the four winds we know blow away
Now he walks down the street in the evening
And he stops by the old candy store
And I somehow believe he's believing
He's holding her hand like before
For he feels all her love walking with him
And he smiles at the things she might say
Then the old man walks up to the hilltop
And gives her a daisy a day

Harder to kill the ghost of a no good man
And I'll be ridin' high in a fandangled sky

It's gonna be easy          from now on

One dusty street to walk up and down
Nothin' much to see but a starvin' hound
In a Mississippi cotton pickin' Delta town
Down in the Delta where I was born
All we raised was cotton, potatoes and corn
I've picked cotton till my fingers hurt
Draggin' the sack through that Delta dirt
And I've worked hard the whole week long
Pickin' my fingers to the blood and bone
There ain't a lot of money in a cotton bale
At least when you try to sell

Catch us a ride on a pickup truck
On a gravel road, it nearly strangled us
That cotton pickin' Delta dust
We'd sit across the street on the depot porch
Lookin' at the folks lookin' back at us
Munchin' on a dust covered ice cream cone
Wondering how we'd get back home

of the dreams that he brings from the wide open seas.
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who sleeps
while the riverbank weeps through the old willow trees.
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who dies
full of beer, full of cries in a drunken down fight.
In the port of Amsterdam, there a sailor who's born
on a muggy hot morn, by the dawn's early light.
In the port of Amsterdam, where the sailors all meet,
there's a sailor who eats only fish heads and tails.
He will show you his teeth that have rotted too soon
that can swallow the moon, that can haul up the sail.
And he yells to the cook with his arms open wide, 
bring me more fish, put it down by my side.
And he wants so to belch, but he's too full to try
so he gets up and he laughs, and he zips up his fly.
In the port of Amsterdam, you can see sailors dance,
haunches bursting their pants, grinding women to paunch.
They've forgotten the tune that their whisky voice croaked,
and they're spitting the night with the roar of their jokes.
And they turn and they dance, and they laugh and they lust
to the rancid sound of the accordion's burst.
then it's out into the night with their pride in their pants
and a slut that they tow underneath the street lamps.
In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who drinks.
and he drinks, and he drinks, and he drinks once again.
He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam
who have promised their love to a thousand other men.
And they bargain their bodies and their virtue, long gone,
for a few dirty coins, and when he can't go on,
he plants his nose in the sky and we wipes it up above
then he splits like I cry for an unfaithful love,
in the port of Amsterdam, in the port of Amsterdam, in the port of Amsterdam.

I don't care what you've said or done I'll always love you so
You've got more love in your little finger than all the rest
And there's nothing better once you've had the best

        And a funky bunch of friends
        If he come down again
        'Cause everybody's got to have somebody to look down on

48,Smokey Put The Sweat On Me,Kris Kristofferson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/kris-kristofferson/smokey-put-the-sweat-on-me-chords-1814852,"I've known some women in every state
New York City to the Golden Gate
I've lived with some, and buddy, I loved 'em all. (Yes, I did)
But no one woman had a claim on me
'Cause I still had a lotta world to see
And I sometimes stagger, but sugar, I seldom fall.
Then like a hungry man, I went to Louisiana
Where the lovin' and the livin' was good
Without a care to hide and just as satisfied as I could be.
A lotta women and wine and not a tie to bind me
And behaving just as cool as I could
'Til that long legged, sweet walkin', ravenhaired and cajun-looking 
Devil put the sweat on me.
They call her Smokey, she's a little bit of evil
Smokey, right as wrong can be.
Smokey, she could shake the very devil
Smokey put the sweat on me.
Smokey put the sweat on me.
Oh, my pulse is a beatin' to the clickety clack
Of this one-way ride that's gonna take me back
And my body's just a-breathin' in that Mississippi River smell
Well, my feet wasn't ready yet for settling down
But my soul kept tellin' me to turn around
And the longer I tried to fight it, the harder I fell
And like a hungry man, I'm goin' to Louisiana
Where the lovin' and the livin' is good
I'll get a brand new bride and be as satisfied as I can be
And I won't even mind the world I'm leavin' behind
Because I never really thought that I could
'Til that long legged, sweet walkin', ravenhaired and cajun-looking 
Devil put the sweat on me.
They call her Smokey, she's a little bit of evil
Smokey, right as wrong can be.
Smokey, she could shake the very devil
Smokey put the sweat on me.
Smokey put the sweat on me
Awww, Smokey put the sweat on me.

God knows I know there are still so many things you wanna be
I've seen enough to understand the pain you're goin' through
It's just a shame to know I'm not enough for you
It hurts to see the hurt beneath your laughter and your lies
And try in vain to free the painful secret locked behind your eyes
And I can't even blame you for the things you're turnin' to
It's just a shame to know I'm not enough for you
I've given you the best of everything I had to give
And now there's nothin' left for me to leave you but my will to live
I hope someday somebody somewhere loves you like I do
It's just a shame to know I'm not enough for you

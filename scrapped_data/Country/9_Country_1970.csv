0,Far Side Banks Of Jordan,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/far-side-banks-of-jordan-chords-676197,"I believe my steps are growing wearier each day
Still I've got another journey on my mind
Lures of this old world have ceased to make me wanna stay
And my one regret is leaving you behind.
But if it proves to be his will that I am first to cross
And somehow  I'll be feeling  it will be
When it comes your time to travel  like wise don't feel lost
For I will be the first one that you'll see.
And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be sitting drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming I will rise up with a shout
And come running through the shallow water reaching for your hand.
(Johnny) Through this life we've labored hard to earn our meager fare
It's brought us trembling hands and failing eyes
(June) So I'll just rest here on this shore and turn my eyes away
Until you come then we'll see paradise.
And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be sitting drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming I will rise up with a shout
And come running through the shallow water reaching for your hand.
And I'll be waiting on the far side banks of Jordan
I'll be sitting drawing pictures in the sand
And when I see you coming I will rise up with a shout
And come running through the shallow water reaching for your hand.

1,Sunday Morning Coming Down (ver 3),Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/sunday-morning-coming-down-chords-778179,"Well, I woke up Sunday morning
With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
Stumbled down the stairs to meet the day
Well I smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and songs that I'd been pickin'
Cussin' at a can that he'd been kickin'
I crossed the empty street
Caught the Sunday smell of someone fryin' chicken
And it took me back to somethin' that I'd lost
Somewhere, somehow along the way
    On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing, Lord, that I was stone
'Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there ain't nothing short of dying
Half as lonesome as the sound
Of a sleeping city sidewalk
Sunday morning coming down

Susanne the plans they made put an end to you
I woke up this morning and wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
Seen sunny days that I thought would never end
Seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought I'd see you again
Won't you look down upon me Jesus you got to help me make a stand
You just got to see me through another day
My body's aching, my time is at hand
I just can't make it any other way
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
Seen sunny days that I thought would never end
Seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought I'd see you again
I've been walking my mind to an easy time my back turned t'wards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it will turn your head around
There's hours of time on the telephone line they'll talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
Seen sunny days that I thought would never end
Seen lonely times when I could not find a friend

Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they rumbled through the sky
Then he saw the riders coming hard,     and he heard their mournful cry

For making my own bed this week, one dollar.
Going to the store, fifty cents.
Playing with little sister
While you went to the store, twenty-five cents.
Taking out the trash, one dollar.
Getting a good report card, five dollars.
And for raking the yard, two dollars.
Total owed, fourteen dollars and seventy-five cents.""

For the nights I sat up with you
Doctored you prayed for you, no charge.

And for wiping you nose, there's no charge.

By Brisbane Waters I chanced to stray
I heard a convict his fate bewailing
As on the sunny riverbank he lay
I am a native of Erin's Ireland
But banished now from my native shore
They stole me from my aged parents
And from the maiden whom I do adore
I've been a prisoner at Port Macquarie
At Norfolk Island and Emu Plains
At Castle Hill and the cursed Toongabbie
At all these settlements I've been in chains
But of all places of condemnation
And penal stations in New South Wales
To Moreton Bay I have found no equal
Excessive tyranny each day prevails
For three long years I was beastly treated
And heavy irons on my legs I wore
My back from flogging was lacerated
And oft times painted with my crimson gore
And many a man from downright starvation
Lies mouldering now underneath the clay
And Captain Logan he had us mangled
All On the triangles of Moreton Bay
Like the Egyptians and ancient Hebrews
We were oppressed under Logan's yoke
Till a native black lying there in ambush
Did deal this tyrant with his mortal stroke
My fellow prisoners be exhilarated
That all such monsters like death may find
And when from bondage we're liberated
Our former suffering soon will fade from mind

shine on the one that's gone
and left me blue
I said blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone
and left me blue
Well it was on one moonlight night
Stars shining bright
Whisper from on high
your Love said goodbye
Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone
and left me blue

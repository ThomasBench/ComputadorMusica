Look at me, still crazy over you
Look at us, still believing in forever

In a hundred years from now,I know without a doubt
They'll all look back and wonder how, we made it all work out.
Chances are, we'll go down in history

They'll just look at us.

Like simple moments adding up?

To follow a dry dirt road that's beckoning
You to the heart of a shimmering summer's day?

To admit that the moon and the sun
Shine so much more brighter when
Seen through two pairs of eyes than
When seen through just one

That lights up just for you?
Have you ever felt more fresh or wonderful
As when you wake by the side of that boy or girl
Who has pledged their love to you?

When the nights go on forever and the days do too
Ohhh, A man this lonely needs a woman like you
I'd lost hope, I was so far down
Here you come turning all that around
I'd come to think of love as a lie
All that's on my mind now is you by my side

A man whose world's been torn in two
Needs somebody with a heart that's true

I'm from the soft blue eyes of a woman in love
I'm a tear of joy she couldn't carry
She was so happy she just got married
I was on her cheek when she wiped me away with her glove
I could tell from the look on her face she didn't need me
So I drifted on down and caught me a ride to the sea
The other tear said we've got a connection
I'm a tear of sorrow born of rejection
I'm from the sad brown eyes of her old flame
She told him they would be lifelong companions
Left him with questions and not any answers
I was on his cheek as he stood there calling her name
I could tell he had a lot of my friends for company
So I drifted on down and caught me a ride to the sea
Oh the ocean's a little bit bigger tonight
Two more teardrops somebody cried
One of them happy and one of them bluer than blue
The tide goes out and the tide comes in
And someday they'll be teardrops again
Released in a moment of pleasure or a moment of pain
Then they drift on down and ride to the sea again
Last night I sat in the waiting room
The nurse walked in and gave me the news
It's a baby girl and they're both fine
An old man sittin' not 10 feet away
Just lost his wife and he said to me
You've got a brand new angel and I've lost mine
I guess the good Lord giveth and the good Lord taketh away
And we both wiped a teardrop from our face
Oh the ocean's a little bit bigger tonight
Two more teardrops somebody cried
One of them happy and one of them bluer than blue

No brother    I am an orphan girl

But the ties of kinship I had not known them
I know no mother no father no sister
No brother    I am an orphan girl
But when he calls me I will be Able
To meet my family at God's table
I'll meet my mother  my father my sister
My brother    no more an orphan girl
Blessed savior make me willing
And walk beside me until I'm with them
Be my     mother my father my  sister
My  brother    I am an orphan girl
Be my     mother my father my  sister
My  brother    I am an orphan girl

  Watched the sun fade in that big red sky.
  I reached under the front seat and said,  ""Now here's something special
  It's just been waiting for a night like tonight""

Not far from the refineries
Aimed at the sky, like smoking guns
I learned to walk, I learned to run away
Tracing back our history
It's a wonder how we came to be
A love driven through a dozen States
With your technique for keeping me awake
The day we met is still a blur
Though I remember just how nice you were
And what you wore in Central Park
And how you left before the darkness fell 
Now I cry over these strings
This sentimental case of things
Though I'm better with each passing day
I guess you'll be the one who got away
'Cause everyone has one of those
You wear them like you wear your clothes
Except they don't come off at night
They are the space you hold up to the light
And somewhere along the line
You'll turn into a friend of mine
Who knows of my unspoken cares
Amid the aftermath of love affairs
Still I cry over these strings
This sentimental case of things
Though I'm better with each passing day
I guess you'll be the one who got away

Suddenly the silence of the frozen room was shattered
By a kid who shot before he called his name
He looked up at his killer from the floor where he had fallen
Said well look what you have gone and done to me

Or his family or his friends
He kept her out there on a limb
Wouldn't let her go, let her in
She wasn't good enough for him
And for years he lead her on
He was doing her all wrong
Break it off and say goodbye
Somebody on the side
That she wasn't good enough for him
Or his family or his friends
He kept her out there on a limb
Wouldn't let her go, let her in
She wasn't good enough for him
He kept her out there on a limb
Wouldn't let her go, let her in
She wasn't good enough for him
When he called her on the phone

When he called her on the phone,
she was good to come and get him,
When he couldn't make it home,
she was good to make love to,
And they did now and then,
she was good to never ask,
When he'd be back again, but,
That she wasn't good enough, for him,
For his family are his friends,
He kept her out there on a limb,
Wouldn't let her go, let her in,
She wasn't good enough for him,
she was there on his bad days,
And for years he lead her on,
we all knew she had some bad case,
He was doing her all wrong,
she couldn't bring herself to do the right thing, 
Break it off and say goodbye,
till she overheard him one night telling,
Somebody on the side,
He kept her out there on a limb, 
wouldn't let her go, let her in,
She wasn't good enough for him,
she was good at late night listening, 
When he called her on the phone,
That she wasn't good enough, for him,
For his family are his friends,
He kept her out there on a limb,
Wouldn't let her go, let her in,
She wasn't good enough for him,

46,Running Shadow,Michael Martin Murphey,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/michael-martin-murphey/running-shadow-chords-2092199,"Wise men spoke the vision   Of the spirit horses way
Like a  saviour he has a mission   From the ashes of the plains
All the souls of mighty warriors   Are carried in his veins
All the hopes of ancient nations   Are flowing through his mane
And the spirit voices say
Never chase a running shadow   Underneath the midnight sky
Never chase a running shadow   You will ride till you die
>From the badlands of Dakota   One lone rider came
To catch the restless spirit  They said could not be tamed
And he laughed at all the legends   He called their stories lies
He called it superstition   Foolish dreams of fading tries
And the spirit voices cry
Never chase a running shadow   Underneath the midnight sky
Never chase a running shadow   You will ride till you die
Over hills and through dark canyons   He chased the steel dust grey
But he could not catch the stallion   He could not break his pace
He persued the racing phantom   To the canyons edge
But running shadow jumped the chasm   Left the outlaw on the ledge
And the spirit voices say
Never chase a running shadow   Underneath the midnight sky
Never chase a running shadow   You will ride till you die
Never chase a running shadow   You will ride till you die

47,Song For My Father,Angels of Light,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/angels-of-light/song-for-my-father-chords-2093217,"  When the warm wind blows
Through the corridors and tiled walls
  There you are
The mad guardian of your empty room
  Your memories were tortured
By the scent of ocean through the halls -
  And where was I
The one that you loved best?
  Now show me how
To hold the knife that cuts the page
  To crucify the weakness
And the guilt I use for faking strength
  Now I remember
I crawled naked across the broken stage
  And there was I
  So walk across
The blood red ocean
Stand above
The broken glass and concrete towers
Some guardian of my empty room
That neither of us knew
Jetzt kannst du schlafen
Jetzt kannst du immer ruhig träumen.)
Thank god you never knew
The things that I've done
  Thank god you never saw
The person I've become

48,I Hung My Head,Blue Highway,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/blue-highway/i-hung-my-head-chords-1247623,"Early one morning with time to kill
I borrowed a rifle and sat on a hill
I saw a lone rider crossing the plain
I drew a bead on him to practice my aim
My brother's rifle went off in my hand
A shot rang out across the land
The horse, it kept running the rider was dead
I hung my head, I hung my head
I set off running to wake from my dream
My brother's rifle went into the stream
I kept on running into the south lands
That's where they found me, my head in my hands
The sheriff he asked me why had I run
And then it came to me just what I had done
And all for no reason just one piece of lead
I hung my head, I hung my head
Here in the court house the whole town was there
I see the judge high up in his chair
""Explain to the court room what went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury what verdict they find""
I felt the power of death and life
I orphaned his children, I widowed his wife
I beg their forgiveness, I wish I were dead
I hung my head, I hung my head
Early one morning with time to kill
I see the gallows high up on a hill
And out in the distance, a trick of the brain
I see a lone rider crossing the plain
He's come to fetch me to see what they've done
And we'll ride together to kingdom come
I prayed for god's mercy for soon I'll be dead
I hung my head,       I hung my head
I hung my head

I Know You've Wondered Now And Then

But I'll Be Proud To Wear Your Ring

Are The Sweetest Ones You've Ever Heard
'Cause I Can't Think Of Anyone
I'd Rather Hold Till Life Is Done

My Love Will Be A Burning Flame

0,A Little Bit Of Everything,Dawes,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/dawes/a-little-bit-of-everything-chords-1040824,"G7        3x3003 (no 5)
With his back against the San Francisco traffic
On the bridges side that faces towards the jail
Setting out to join a demographic,
He hoists his first leg up over the rail.
A phone call's made, police cars show up quickly.
The sergeant slams his passenger door.
He says, Hey son why don't you talk through this with me,
Just tell me what you're doing it for.
Oh, it's a little bit of everything,
It's the mountains, it's the fog,
It's the news at six o'clock,
It's the death of my first dog.
It's the angels up above me,
It's the song that they don't sing,
It's a little bit of everything.
There's an older man who stands in a buffet line,
He is smiling and he's holding out his plate,
And the further he looks back into his timeline,
That hard road always led him to today.
Making up for when his bright future had left him,
Making up for the fact that his only son is gone,
And letting everything out once, his server asks him,
Have you figured out yet, what it is you want?
I want a little bit of everything,
The biscuits and the beans,
Whatever helps me to forget about
The things that brought me to my knees.
So pile on those mashed potatoes,
And an extra chicken wing,
I'm having a little bit of everything.
Somewhere a pretty girl is writing invitations,
To a wedding she has scheduled for the fall,
Her man says, Baby, can I make an observation?
You don't seem to be having any fun at all.
She said, You just worry about your groomsmen and your shirt-size,
And rest assured that this is making me feel good,
I think that love is so much easier than you realize,
If you can give yourself to someone, then you should.
Cause it's a little bit of everything,
The way you joke, the way you ache,
It is getting up before you,
So I could watch you as you wake.
So on the day in late September,
It's not some stupid little ring,
I'm getting a little bit of everything.
Oh, it's a little bit of everything,
It's the matador and the bull,
It's the suggested daily dosage,
It's the red moon when it's full.
All these psychics and these doctors,
They're all right and they're all wrong,
It's like trying to make out every word,
When they should simply hum along.
It's not some message written in the dark,
Or some truth that no one's sees,
It's a little bit of everything.

1,Parachute,Chris Stapleton,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/chris-stapleton/parachute-chords-1678321,"Street lights along the highway, throwin’ shadows through the dark
And the memories keep on turnin’, to the rhythm of a broken heart
You only need a roof when it’s raining…
you only need a fire when it’s cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey…
is the only thing that you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down…
the fallin’ feels like flyin’ ‘till you hit the ground
Say the word and I’ll be there for you…
baby I will be your parachute
Parachute
There’s a song that I remember… that I never learned to play
And a lifetime of forgotten words… I never got to say
You only need a roof when it’s raining…
you only need a fire when it’s cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey…
is the only thing that you have left to hold
Sun comes up and goes back down…
the fallin’ feels like flyin’ ‘till you hit the ground
Say the word and I’ll be there for you…
baby I will be your parachute
Parachute
If you think your goin’ down…
just know I will be around
You only need a roof when it’s raining…
you only need a fire when it’s cold
You only need a drink when the whiskey…

Sun comes up and goes back down…
the fallin’ feels like flyin’ ‘till you hit the ground
Say the word and I’ll be there for you…
baby I will be your parachute

That Cadillac came and gave our girl the ride
Loss has no end, it binds to our connection
And we don’t speak of it, we don’t even try
If you could help me to share the trouble
That you’ve got burnin in you, then you can help me
And in our time together her memory will ever
Shine like golden embers in the night
I miss the old hymns, when she used to sing
The sparrows spread their mortal wings
For now they’ve all alighted, with the silence of strings
Like notes on the pages, she breathed life into all things
If you could help me to share the trouble
That you’ve got burnin in you, then you can help me
And in our time together her memory will ever
Shine like golden embers in the night
Just like an old friend, reach out to me
And bathe me in the light of understanding

And I may yet fall apart

And that I was sitting on a pile like Warren Buffett

It could buy me a Yeti 110 iced down with some Silver Bullets
Yeah, I know what they say, money can’t buy everything
Well, maybe so,    but it can buy me a boat
They call me redneck, white trash and blue collar
I could change all that if I had a couple million dollars
I keep hearing that money is the root of all evil
And you can’t fit a camel through the eye of a needle

bitch about the weekend crowd,

Seagram's in a coffee cup,
sharecropper eyes and her hair almost all gone.
When she was drunk she made cancer jokes,
she made up her own doctor's notes,
surrounded by her family, I saw that she was dying alone.
I'd sing her classic country songs
and she'd get high and sing along.
She don't have much voice to sing with now
We'd burn these joints in effigy,
cry about what we used to be,
and try to ignore the elephant somehow.

I buried her a thousand times,
given up my place in line,

no one dies with dignity.

Where is he tonight?
He’s sleeping with her in a Tennessee town and he is fine
I think I lost my mind, and my wasted time
I’m dreaming alone in a hotel bed that he is mine
Bought a gown to match his name
Kept my virtue just the same
So I could offer to my love
A bride he could be proud of
I was sure I held his heart
‘Til a Louisiana girl tore us apart
Watched him as he turned away
Into her arms, where he stayed
Davey White, 
Where is he tonight?
He’s sleeping with her in a Tennessee town and he is fine
I think I lost my mind, and my wasted time
I’m dreaming alone in a hotel bed that he is mine
Once my tears had all run out
I learned how to live without
Pieces left behind in tow
I took to the hard road
Strangers know the songs I write
They come to hear me sing at night
They don’t know I’ve paid the cost
They don’t know what I lost
Davey White, 
Where is he tonight?
He’s sleeping with her in a Tennessee town and he is fine
I think I lost my mind, and my wasted time
I’m dreaming alone in a hotel bed that he is mine
‘Til all the miles erase my pain
‘Til all the hurt is gone again
Searching for the next mistake
Who never ever would replace

Grandma and grandpa painted a picture
Of 65 years in one little house
More than a memory
More than saying I do
Kiss you goodnights
And I love you’s
Me and you baby
We’ll walk in their footsteps
We’ll build our own family
One day at a time
10 little toes
A painted pink room
Our beautiful baby looks just like you
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
Now til forever it’s all of me, all of you
Just take my hand and I’ll be the man your dad hoped that I’d be
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I’ll stand through the good and the bad
We’ll give all that we have
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
This life will go by in the blink of an eye
But I wouldn’t wanna spend it without you by my side
The clouds are gonna roll
The earth’s gonna shake
But I’ll be your shelter
Through the wind and the rain
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
Now til forever it’s all of me, all of you
Just take my hand and I’ll be the man your dad hoped that I’d be
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I’ll stand through the good and the bad
We’ll give all that we have
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
Someday we’ll wake up with thousands of pictures
Of 65 years in this little house
I won’t trade for nothin’ the life that we built
I’ll kiss you goodnight and say I love you still
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I’ll stand through the good and the bad

Sittin' lookin' pretty   by the fire in a lawn chair

Her ruby red lips were sippin' on sweet tea
  Shot me a look like a shootin' star
  So I grabbed a beer & my ol' guitar, then we
  Sat around 'til the break of dawn

The deal was we would get to go, if we
Cleaned it up, and got it running,
Daddy's old Winnebago.
Wing and a prayer down 65,
Five best friends on four bald tires,
I can still see Billy smiling
When we finally made it.
To Talladega, boys raised up,
Whiskey in your glass, 
here's to turning up, slowing down 
and cars that go real fast,
We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,
Sure would like to stay in, 
Talladega.
Like a storm, time rolls on,
You can't hit pause as we just did.
Most days in life don't stand out,
But life's about those days that will, like,
Rocking rando, getting rowdy,
Shooting roman candles at the man in the moon,
til the Alabama sun was breaking.
Over Talladega, boys raised up,
Whiskey in your glass, 
here's to turning up, slowing down 
and cars that go real fast,
We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,
Sure would like to stay in,

When the winds go cold and it blows October,
I think about us shoulder to shoulder,
Like those cars my thoughts roll over and over and over,
In my mind
Tonight i'm in Talladega, boys raised up,
Whiskey in your glass,

You can tell she isn't sure
Let you know she's up to something
She's never done before
Tonight she wants to hold a stranger
But not the one at home
If she's lonely now, she won't be lonely long
Heaven help the fool who did her wrong
It's too late, too bad, she's too far gone
He should have thought of that before he left her all alone
If she's lonely now, she won't be lonely long
If I had a woman like that, man, I'd let her know
I'd hold her tight, I'd hold her close
Do anything, do everything to let her know,
She'd never, ever be alone
Heaven help the fool who did her wrong
It's too late, too bad, she's too far gone
He should have thought of that before he left her all alone
If she's lonely now, Lord if she's lonely now
If she's lonely now, she won't be lonely long

it be better for a few more days

Broke my back and did my best
to hold you through the shakes

How can I get to the shore on time
if you won't keep afloat

let alone the ones you've played
I've only got one and it's already broken
so why you wanna throw it around
I wish I had the strength to go

My mind’s a mile a minute, my thoughts they bark like hounds
but I’m focused on my breathing in the universal sound
I think about my darling girl, sleeping all alone
I pray the stars will shoot her all the wishes she can hold
On the day that I return, I aim to lay her down
But right now, I’m focused on the universal sound
I think about tobacco juice and Mason jars of shine
I think about the vices I’ve let take me over time
I recall when I was a baby, I didn’t need nothing around
But a little bitty rattler and the universal sound
I close my eyes
It was all so clear
It was all right then
It was all right here
I focus on my breathin’ in the universal sound
I let it take me over from the toenails to the crown
‘Til the body that I’m in, ‘til they put me in the ground
And I return to the chorus of the universal sound
I’ve been up on the mountain, and I’ve seen his wondrous grace
I’ve sat there on a bar stool, and I’ve looked him in the face
He seemed a little haggard, but it did not slow him down
He was humming to the neon of the universal sound

Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck, she jumped up and cut me off

When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now

What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinking that her leaving
Is the only logical reason
That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes

44,Hell And You,Amigo The Devil,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/amigo-the-devil/hell-and-you-chords-1909150,"Went to the bar
To get a little closer to myself and learn
Things I never really wanted to know
The walk got a little far
So I got into a cab that smelled like vinegar
Stains that showed what's in the girl before
But I want to be where all
The stupid things I say sound so
Romantic and true
'Cause I'd rot in Hell with you
If you'd just ask me to
I love the shitty things we do together
Live with me in this sin forever
Hell and you
I know you want it too
I say take the shot, see this chance
Feel the fire and let me have this
Dance with you
We take things a little far
But you couldn't name a place I wouldn't go with you
A plane, a train, a car, I'd run
If I was dead I'd float
I'd crawl in bed with you
Even on someone else's blood
On top of someone else's love
In the worst motel we find
'Cause home is the last place that I'd stand
To be with anyone but you
'Cause I'd rot in Hell with you
If you'd just ask me to
I love the shitty things we do together
Live with me in this sin forever
Hell and you
I know you want it too
I say take the shot, see this chance
Feel the fire and let me have this
Dance with you

That I'm in love
And I don't know what else to say
But thank you Lord
For that sundress on that Saturday
Walkin' barefoot down the beach
Smell of the rain up in the air
Smell the flowers in her hair
And I swear on my life
If you need a joke? I'll be there
You need a smoke? Here take my spare
I always thought that you were fine
So whataya say when we're 26
We'll get married just for kicks and
Move out to Alaska way up there
I'll get a job stacking bricks
You stay at home with the kids and
I'll bring the bacon back home to you girl
We're making the best of this world

And this young love
It's got me high

Man I was just checkin' in, hope you’ve been well
Seein' as you're the only one with a choice in the matter
To do damn near anything, that you ought to
I guess what I'm sayin' is, if you don't change
Boy, you'll be kickin' yourself one of these days
So maybe you should call our Mama, have a drink with our old man
Quit wastin' our sweet time and put that diamond on her hand
Stop takin' me for granted like I'll always be around
Cause even as you read this boy that clock is tickin' down
And remember every second I got's borrowed
So I hope you think of me today, sincerely tomorrow
Listen I ain't tryin', to bring you down
Cause I sure know better than, pushin' you around
I guess I was just lookin' out, for you and me both
Cause we both lose if I told you so
So maybe you should call our Mama, have a drink with our old man
Quit wastin' our sweet time and put that diamond on her hand
Stop takin' me for granted like I'll always be around

In a world full of people out to cut his young ass down
No one ever understood a single word he said
They cast him to the wolves when he wasn't well and fed
Boys, we've got a riser, a riser in our midsts
And he will get the last laugh if it's the last thing he did
And he used to to roll around in that red dirt mud
But now he's skippin' town and that riser's out for blood
Don't stop goin', goin' south
'Cause they'll let you play your music real damn loud
Don't stop heading, heading south
'Cause they will understand the words that are pouring from your mouth
And that boy called his daddy, to tell him what he did
As the masses scream the lyrics of the messed up kid
And then he told that old man he was never coming back
To be cut down again in a town like that
And he surely came to learn: people come to watch you fall
He's out to make a name and a fool out of 'em all
And they'll never understand that boy and his kind
'Cause all they comprehend is a fucking dollar sign
So don't stop goin', goin' south
'Cause they'll let you play your music real damn loud
Don't stop heading, heading south
'Cause they will understand the words that are pouring from your mouth
Don't stop goin', goin' south
They will understand the words that are pouring from your mouth
Don't stop goin', goin' south
'Cause they'll let you scream your music real damn loud

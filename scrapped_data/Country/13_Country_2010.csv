0,Huntin Fishin And Lovin Every Day (ver 2),Luke Bryan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/luke-bryan/huntin-fishin-and-lovin-every-day-chords-1761372,"If I could make a livin' from walkin' in the woods
You can bet I'd be sittin' pretty good
High on a hill looking at a field down wind
If I could make a nickel off of turnin' them bass
Never worry bout the price of gas
I'd be wheelin' and dealin' and sittin' there reelin' 'em in
Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
Early in the mornin', late in the evenin'
I'm getting red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
I get a little farm pond buzz
Sound of gravel when I'm backin' up
Pullin' the string on a 9.9 two-stroke (Mercury)
I love it when my baby wants to roll with me
Throws her boots on, climbs in a tree
Tuckin' her hair in my hat and she's ready to go
And we get to huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the mornin', late in the evenin'
I'm getting red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
So while y'all are up there
Breathin' in that old dirty air
I'll be down here
Knee-deep in the Muckalee
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
I wanna see them tall pines sway
Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer this country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Black coffee in the mornin, dark whiskey in the evenin'
I'm gettin' red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Won't you come along with me
Won't you come along with me
I know you wanna see
Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day

1,Hallelujah,Ryan Bingham,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ryan-bingham/hallelujah-chords-2654475,"Em7/D    x50000 (slide up on 5th string)
 The other day I found myself up on the corner
I thought I run into a friend of mine
 Ended up that he was just a stranger
I said hello as he passed me by
But then he turned and put a gun to my head
He said, ""My friend, I'm going to rob you blind""
 I said, ""You must be down on your luck
I'm out of money and I'm all out of time""
 He pulled the trigger and I fell to my knees
My spirit left and then my body went cold
 I'm looking down upon the lights of the city
I feel alive, but I'm dead and gone
 Ain't no more walking down the side of the road
Ain't no more sleeping on the edge of a frown
 Ain't no more favors from someone I don't know
'Cause there ain't nobody hear me, nobody's around
      Hallelujah,   coming home
Hallelujah,   he's dead and gone
Hallelujah,   something's wrong
Oh, hallelujah
 So tell me now if your singing can bring me
Another day with my feet on the ground
 I miss living and living misses me
I miss it so much that I'm holding me down
 For all the things that I never could change
For all the reasons that I never understood and why
I feel alone, baby, I'm dead and gone, baby
And something's wrong, 'cause you know I still feel alive
 My train is rolling down the line and I'm waiting till it bring me to dream
Of holding you up in my eyes
Oh feel my love, honey from up above, honey
Oh, don't give up on me, 'cause I'm coming down
 I'm not a one nighter, I'm not a flat liner
I've everything in between the harmony singing loud
      Hallelujah,   coming home
Oh, hallelujah,   he's dead and gone
Hallelujah,   something's wrong
Oh, hallelujah,           it's just a song
 The other day I found myself up on the corner
I thought I run into a friend of mine

So get a grip, take a sip of that feel right

We rollin' into town
With nothing else to do we take another lap around
Yeah holla at your boy if you need a ride
If you roll with me yeah you know we rollin' high
Up on those 37 Nittos, windows tinted hard to see though
How fresh my baby is in the shotgun seat oh
Them kisses are for me though, automatic like a free throw
This life I live it might not be for you but it's for me though
This is how we roll
We hanging round singing out everything on the radio
We light it up with our hands up
This is how we roll

When the world turns ugly I just turn and look at you baby

We stick to our guns
We love who we love and we wanna have fun

Dreamin' of the days when you were in my arms, I had never felt so alive
I spent my days workin', spent my nights drinkin' howlin' at the moon
Screaming for the days when you were coming back no it couldn't come too soon
Couldn't come too soon
When I was gonna be your forever you were gonna be my wife
But you went off to find better and I was learning all about life
But I was what you wanted, you were what I needed, and we could meet in between
We were gonna be the greatest love story this town had ever seen
So you came back after a long four years your college boyfriend didn't work out
So we went out for a couple of drinks to find out who we are now
Sure, we changed but way deep down you had the same old feelings for me
I went to the store and I bought you a ring and I got down on one knee down on one knee

Momma poured grease in a Chrisco can
Put a hundred thousand miles on a Sears box fan

Drove me around in the back of that truck

You know what you're doin' girl
You know what it does to me

Baby I'm gone, before the part about you
Dancin' in slow motion with my hands on your hips
Now you got me going right where I can't resist

Flipped off that ""ya'll come back"" sign

Had a hell of a time and we went all night

I swore her off, but I'll be damned

Picked up right where we left off
Raised hell with the boys
Made all kinds of noise
Singing at the top of our lungs
Yeah once again I'll wake up on tile
With the headache turned up to 10
Asking myself why the hell

They've all been a bittersweet buzz
And I've had some vices, most more than thrice
And none does me quite like she does
I try to forget her, wish I'd never met her
But I'll let her waltz right on in
Now come Friday night
I'll fall right back in love with tequila again

Raised hell with the boys
Made all kinds of noise
Singing at the top of our lungs

An Olivia, maybe a Cassidy
With the shaky hands on the cardboard sign
And she's looking at me
 Bet she was somebody's best friend laughing
Back when she was somebody's sister
Counting change at the lemonade stand
Probably somebody's high school first kiss
Dancing in a gym where the kids all talk about someday plans
Now this light'll turn green and I'll hand her a couple dollars
And I'll wonder if she got lost or they forgot her
She's somebody's daughter
Somebody's daughter
Somebody's daughter
Well, did she give up wondering where the cars all go?
Can she even tell that I don't know what to say?
So I just nod my head and wave
Well, no one's gonna ask what she wants to be
Or why we're both stuck here at the mercy of geography
And whether it shines or rains
 Bet she was somebody's best friend laughing

110, it felt like nothing on an August day
Down to the Haw to wash it all away
Hear the holler of the ten point white tailed caller
Circle left and promenade
Cicadas in the summer time and cider in the fall
If I can’t have the girl I love then I won’t love at all
And I’ll catch my own damn self when I fall
To miss all those days gone by
And long for those better times
I wish I could ease your mind
Like the wind blowing wild through the long leaf pines

[Chorus]
Anxiety, how do you always get the best of me
I'm out here living in a fantasy
I can't enjoy a goddamn thing
Anxiety, why am I never where I am supposed to be
Even with my lover sleeping close to me
I'm wide awake and I'm in pain
Watching the sunrise slash through the blinds
Dust in the room hovers over mine
Lying here in silence, Wife and child still sleeping deep enough to dream
And oh, I'm a lucky man today but so afraid that time will take it all from me
Anxiety, how do you always get the best of me 
I'm out here living in a fantasy
I can't enjoy a goddamn thing
Anxiety, why am I never where I am supposed to be
Even with my lover sleeping close to me
I'm wide awake and I'm in pain
It's the weight of the world but it's nothing at all
Light as a prayer, and then I feel myself fall
You got to give me a minute because I'm way down in it and I can't breathe so I can't speak
I want to be strong and steady, always ready, now, I feel so small, I feel so weak
Anxiety, how do you always get the best of me
I'm out here living in a fantasy
I can't enjoy a goddamn thing
Anxiety, why am I never where I am supposed to be
Even with my lover sleeping close to me
I'm wide awake and I'm in pain
A crowded room is a burning battlefield
If I don't move, I'll come undone
My heart beats harder, a hammer striking steel
Will I walk now or be a ""Wait and Run""
Anxiety, how do you always get the best of me
I'm out here living in a fantasy
I can't enjoy a goddamn thing
Anxiety, why am I never where I am supposed to be
Even with my lover sleeping close to me
I'm wide awake and I'm in pain
I'm wide awake and I'm in pain
I'm wide awake and I'm in pain

48,Something To Love (ver 2),Jason Isbell and The 400 Unit,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jason-isbell-and-the-400-unit/something-to-love-chords-2074175,"I hope you find something to love
Something to do when you feel like giving up
A song to sing or a tale to tell
Something to love, it'll serve you well
I was born in a tiny Southern town
I grew up with all my family around
We made music on the porch on Sunday nights,
Old men with old guitars, smoking Winston Lights
Old women harmonizing with the wind
Singing softly to the savior like a friend
They taught me how to make the chords and sing the words
I'm still singing like that great speckled bird
I hope you find something to love
Something to do when you feel like giving up
A song to sing or a tale to tell
Something to love, it'll serve you well
Tonight we're lying on a blanket in the yard
The wind is cold, the sky is dark, the ground is hard
But your mama loves to count the stars at night,
So if I get a little chill then that's alright
I hope you find something to love
Something to do when you feel like giving up
A song to sing or a tale to tell
Something to love, it'll serve you well
You were born on a hot late summer day
We turned you loose and tried to stay out of your way
I don't quite recognize the world that you'll call home
Just find what makes you happy girl, and do it 'til you're gone
I hope you find something to love
Something to do when you feel like giving up
A song to sing or a tale to tell
Something to love, it'll serve you well
Something to love, it'll serve you well

49,Ride Me Back Home,Willie Nelson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/willie-nelson/ride-me-back-home-chords-2683320,"  We rode into battle barebacked and saddled
You took the wound in your side
You pulled the sleds and you pulled the wagons
You gave 'em somewhere to hide
  Now they don't need you and there's no one to feed you
And there's fences where you used to roam
I wish I could gather up all of your brothers
And you would just ride me back home
Ride me back home to a much better place
Blue skies and sunshine and plenty of space
Somewhere where they would just leave you alone
Somewhere that you could call home
And you would just ride me back home
  I got a small place  up in the foothills
Where green grass is precious as gold
I paid a fortune for what little I got here
But you know that I'd sell my soul
To have all the mountains, the rivers and valleys
The places where you need to roam
And I would just gather up all of your brothers
And you would just ride me back home
Ride me back home to a much better place
Blue skies and sunshine and plenty of space
Somewhere where they would just leave you alone
Somewhere that you could call home
And you would just ride me back home
Ride me back home to a much better place
Blue skies and sunshine and plenty of space
Somewhere where they would just leave you alone
Somewhere that you could call home
And you would just ride me back home

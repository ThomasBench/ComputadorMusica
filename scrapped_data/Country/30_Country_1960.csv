never meaning what they say now,   never saying what they mean.
While they wile away the hours in their ivory towers
'till they're covered up with flowers in the back of a black limousine.
La-da da da da da da da, la-da da da da da de;
talking 'bout you and me   and the games people play.
Oh, we make one another cry, break a heart then we say goodbye,
cross our hearts and we hope to die,   that the other was to blame.
Neither one will ever give in, so we gaze at our eight by ten,
thinking 'bout the things that might have been,   it's a dirty rotten shame.
People walking up to you, shoutingglory hallelulia,
and they're tryin to sock it to you,   in the name of the Lord.
They're gonna teach you how to meditate, read your horoscope, cheat your faith,
and further more to hell with hate,   come on and get on board. 
La-da da da da da da da, la-da da da da da de;
Talking 'bout you and me   and the games people play.
Look around tell me what you see, what's happening to you and me,
God grant me the serenity,   to remember who I am.
'Cause you've given up your sanity, for your pride and your vanity,
turn your back on humanity   and you don't give a da da da da da.
La-da da da da da da da, la-da da da da da de;
Talking 'bout you and me   and the games people play.

It's hard for me to smile

Friends won't know the pain that I feel
Or the misery that I'm in
Everyone thinks I'm so happy
For I smile and never frown
But looks are deceiving
And nobody knows
The hurt behind the face of a clown
I've got my pride and my tears I'll hide
Whenever you’re around
You’ll never, never know  you hurt me so
   For I have a face of a clown
  I'll try to conceal  this pain that I feel
I can't let it get me down
You won't have the pleasure of kno-o-wing
The hurt behind the face of a clown
You won't have the pleasure of knowing
The hurt behind the face of a clown

And I don't wanna lose her heaven knows I try

You see I love her I love her in spite of all she's done

He preached about that great eterni ty
He preached hell so hot that you could feel the heat

Revivals and camp meetings went for weeks
Folks came from all around to hear him preach
Daddy said if one is saved It's worth it all
But, the aisles were always filled at altar call
Daddy worked for God but asked no pay
For he believed that God provides the way
We never had a lot but we got by
I guess it's cause the Lord was on my daddy's side
Yes Daddy was an old time preacher man
In the sweet by and by
We shall meet on that beautiful shore
I'm on my way to Canaan land

And you ain't got nothin' to lose
Allemande right she can play it all night
She can fiddle off the bottom of your shoes
Oh me, oh my, how she makes that bowhair fly
How she hangs that music in the air
Promenade down to the lonesome sound
Of a whip-poor-will in the night
Sashay back, look at old mad Jack
Hugging everything in sight
Oh me, oh my, how she makes that bowhair fly
How she hangs that music in the air
Banjo Bill, he stopped stock still
As the notes came a-rolling by
It filled his ears and eased his fears
And a tear come to his eye
Oh me, oh my, how she makes that bowhair fly
How she hangs that music in the air
The old string bass he lost his place
And his arms, they felt like steel
The guitar man dropped both his hands
And he swore it was not real
Oh me, oh my, how she makes that bowhair fly
How she hangs that bristol in the air
It's golden strings on eagle's wings
To the callin' of the squares
And there's fiddle tunes and there's fiddle tunes
But Virginia's splittin' hairs
Oh me, oh my, how she makes that bowhair fly
How she hangs that music in the air
She cast a spell no tongue can tell
No prophet can reveal
Quiet as death, hold your breath
She played ""Virginia's Real""
Oh me, oh my, how she makes that bowhair fly
How she hangs that music in the air
Oh me, oh my, how she makes that bowhair fly
How she hangs that music in the air

I swear to you friend that that life is some risky
I have backed away quickly from those that would burn me
And stopped up my ears that no one should learn me
But the lady beside me
is the one I have chosen
to walk through life
like a coat from the cold
I have flown like a bird from every cage that confined me
and broken every one of the ties that bind me
I have danced me around some sad ol' sad ol situations
and taken my share of those sweet invitations
But the lady beside me

to walk through life

2,The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/the-night-they-drove-old-dixie-down-chords-2385237,"Virgil Caine is my name
And I served on the Danville train
'Till Stoneman's cavalry came
And tore up the tracks again
In the winter of '65
We were hungry, just barely alive
By May the 10th, Richmond had fell
It's a time I remember, oh so well
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the people were singing
They went, ""Na, na, na, na, na, na na
Na, na, na, na, na, na na""
Back with my wife in Tennessee
When one day she called to me
Said ""Virgil, quick, come see, Virgil,
There goes the Robert E. Lee!""
Now, I don't mind chopping wood
And I don't care if the money's no good
You take what you need
And you leave the rest
But they never should
Have taken the very best
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the people were singing
They went, ""Na, na, na, na, na, na na
Na, na, na, na, na, na na""
Like my father before me
I will work the land
And like my brother above me
Who took a rebel stand
He was just 18, proud and brave
But a Yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the mud below my feet
You can't raise a Caine back up
When he's in defeat
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the people were singing
They went, ""Na, na, na, na, na, na na
Na, na, na, na, na, na na""

She was ugly as she could be
Looking for a kid about half her age
To show him what there was to see
Morgana knew more tricks than Houdini
She could make a blind man see
Make a crippled man run along
High hurdles and Morgana's coming after me.
Morgana leave me alone
   I don't need none of your action
Morgana leave me alone
 I got my own kind of satisfaction.
I gave ten dollars for an hour and a half
God, it sure went fast!
Morgana kept her eyes on her watch
She knew how long I'd last
Many was the time I'd hide up in the hills
It was that or the undertaker
And morning would come and I'd tip-toe out
And pray to God I wouldn't wake her!
Morgana leave me alone
   I don't need none of your action
Morgana leave me alone
 I got my own kind of satisfaction
Now that I think about poor Morgana
She really wasn't all there
I know she's not the best I've known
But she's sure not the worst I've had
It really didn't matter when she said it was over
I didn't have to bother
The thing that hurt when she looked at me
Said I'd never be as good as my father.
Morgana leave me alone
   I don't need none of your action
Morgana leave me alone
 I got my own kind of satisfaction
Don't you talk about Morgana

They take a little freedom each time they let you

bargain with her lovin' and try to tie me down.

But teasin' in my memory was something twice as good.

Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on

Yes, they'll all come to meet me

It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Four gray walls surround me
And I realize I was only dreaming
There's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak
Again I'll touch the green, green grass of home
Yes, they'll all come to see me
In the shade, of that old oak tree
As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home

Ridin' somewhere on a train
Empty sleeve pinned to his shoulder
And some pills to ease the pain
Started drinkin' in El Paso,
He was drunk in San Antone,
Tellin' strangers who were sleepin'
How he hated goin' home
Just a simple song of freedom,
He was never fightin' for,
No one's listenin' when you need 'em,
Ain't no fun to sing that song no more.
Got a song about a sister,
Waitin' somewhere by the phone,
For some man who never missed her,
Ever since he come and gone
And it's harder for a woman,
With a baby on the way,
That's the price of bein' human,
When you're poor enough to pay,
So she listens to the freedom,
In the silence at her door
No one's missin' till you need 'em
Ain't no fun to sing that song no more
Got a song about a Savior,
Lookin' lonesome and afraid,
At a city full of strangers,
And a cross He never made
And He's sadder than He's wiser,
And a longer way from home,
And He wonders why His Father,
Left Him bleeding and alone.
Just a broken song of freedom,
And the closing of a door,

  Ice cream castles in the air
Feathered canyons everywhere
   I've looked at clouds that way
   Now they only block the sun
   They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I could have done
But clouds got in my way
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds      at all
   Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
   Dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way
Now it's just another show
   Leave them laughing when you go
And if you care don't let them know
  Don't give yourself away
I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love   at all
Tears and fears and feeling proud
Say I love you right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way
   But now old friends are acting strange
   They shake their heads they say I've changed
Something's lost and something's gained
In living every day
I've looked at life from both sides now 
From win and lose and still somehow 
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life    at all

Why I should walk for more

Too many lonely nights
To turn your head around
Your truth will reward you in the end
And the love you were faithful to
Will comfort you again
As I look into the future
I can see a distant past
But the haze that lies before me
Leaves me spinnin' in the night....
Will my light come shinin' through?
I'd give all of my tomorrows

But there's been too many mornings comin' down
Too many lonely nights

I'm living a lie and there's no need in trying
To keep hanging on after all the good is gone

All about the sweet child's holy face and the saints who sung out loud

And the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre
Did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madame
Have rung the chapel bell
""C'est la vie"", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
""C'est la vie"", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell
""C'est la vie"", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

No one in this whole wide world
Knows the way I feel
I've been a long lost soul
For a long, long time
Yeah, I've been around
Everybody ought to know what's on my mind
You think I'm lonesome, so do I, so do I
Well, I'm the kind of girl
Who likes to make a living running around
To let me know my baby's let me down
You think I'm lonesome, so do I, so do I
Luxury liner, forty tons of steel
No one in this whole wide world
Knows the way I feel
I've been a long lost soul
For a long, long time
Yeah, I've been around
Everybody ought to know what's on my mind
You think I'm lonesome, so do I, so do I
Luxury liner, forty tons of steel
I've been a long lost soul
For a long, long time
Yeah, I've been around
Everybody ought to know what's on my mind

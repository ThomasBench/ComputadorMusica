0,I Kill Spiders,Granger Smith,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/granger-smith/i-kill-spiders-chords-3557501,"Daddy, daddy come here I'm scared
I need you
I heard her calling my name from down the stairs
Daddy please come quick, I’m really scared
I walked into her room and sat down beside her
She said there’s something way down in the sheets
Daddy please would you look, what could it be?
She held onto my arm, said maybe a spider
And I said
Whenever you're lost and in the dark
Remember you got me right in your heart
I can make anything a little bit brighter
There's nothing to fear in this big ol' world
'Cause you got me my sweet little girl
And 'til my last breath Ill be your fighter
I kill spiders
I kill spiders
I brushed the tear off her cheek, she closed her eyes
I put together my hands and hit my knees
God up in heaven will you give me the strength
To be the dad she really needs
Give her the courage to hear me and believe
When I say
Whenever you're lost and in the dark
Remember you got me right in your heart
I can make anything a little bit brighter
There's nothing to fear in this big ol' world
'Cause you got me my sweet little girl
And 'til my last breath Ill be your fighter
I kill spiders
I kill spiders
I could make a million bucks or be famous on TV
Yeah but that don’t really matter at all
Cause what she needs to hear from me is
Whenever you're lost and in the dark
Remember you got me right in your heart
I can make anything a little bit brighter
There's nothing to fear in this big ol' world
'Cause you got me my sweet baby girl
And 'til my last breath Ill be your fighter
I kill spiders
I kill spiders

 There must’ve been a reason
 And I can't ever think that

On this front porch with my baby, nowhere else I'd rather be
I can just look around, it ain't hard to see
God's been good, so good to me
 Breathless feeling on my lungs with a Technicolor Sunset
Settin' like a fire in the night sky
 And pull her in and get a kiss, little honey on my lips
Even sweeter than a drip off a beehive
 Closest you can get to perfect
 Heaven knows I don't deserve it

Then I took one look outside
I couldn’t bring myself to believe it
Let down once again by the sky
This was supposed to be our one day together
You promised me that we’d run in the sun (yes you did)
Instead we’re all locked up down in misery
Stuck inside how are we supposed to have any fun?
If I don’t get out, you know I’ll go crazy
The only place that I feel free
Why’d you have to go and rain?
Why’d you have to go and rain?
Well I hate the rain, evеrybody knows it
And there at no fucking way I’m walking out that door
So just wake mе up when it’s all over
And I’ll have something, something to live for
Slipped into a dream, dreamed I was running
Down a neverending beach with you
And then I go run and hiding in the beach grass
Then come running, smiling back to you
If I don’t get out, you know I’ll go crazy
The only place that I feel free
Why’d you have to go and rain?
Why’d you have to go and rain?
It’s not that I’m sad, it’s not that I’m lazy
It's the only place that I feel free
Why’d you have to go and rain?

Some kids at the school had beaten him way past tears
His mom cried ""Jesus Christ"" as she cleaned the blood pouring out of his ears...
But it was obvious that, quiet as a rat, God was nowhere near
There was a girl at the bar
She overdosed in a photo booth
Nobody found her body until last call
The pictures all showed her terrified and a loner
While everyone cried what a great friend she was
And everyone treats commandments like more like a bucket list so
I've been been asking why I was born against?
Time doesn't respect what doesn't respect it
And kind isn't a word I would use for man
If everyone's made in ""his"" image and even ""he"" couldn't perfect it
Then what the hell makes anyone think we can?
He had the faith of a dog, the debt of a sinner
And a chain tied from his neck to around a tree
He taped a hospital bill to the dashboard... kissed the ring on his finger
And drove himself to eternity
I've been trying to hide I was born against
I wonder if I'll die... born against

I just been kicking round alone
Did you hear my wife just left me?
I came home last night and my own was gone
Whadda you say we go have a drink, and talk about the cold facts of life?
With the hell me and you have had our hearts struck through
We could drink about it all night
Over a smooth shot of whiskey
We could go through a lot of mem'ries
Life has been rough on us lately
And I'll drink to that
Pour another smooth shot of whiskey
Just toast the blue side of mis'ry

How could I forget, I was the best man

You lost yours and I lost mine there's a lot of that going round these days
Well it's hard to believe that we'd ever see the two of us hurtin' this way

and eyes are made for glances
and songs are played, legs are made for dances
Go on and take her hand heart
And draw a line in the sand heart

Don't let fear steal your brave heart
Don't let doubt take your faith heart

But don't never break heart
And when your time comes heart
When it's all said and done heart

I'd tie it to my side
Never be without the power
To make a man do right
Steady on my shoulders
Standing in the wind
Well I've been down before
But I won't be down again
And if I had a pony
How fast I would ride
Yippie-tiy-iy-ay
With the shotgun at my side
An outlaw to my foes
A hero to my friends
I've been down before
But I won't be down again
Well the days would be so easy
The nights would be so slow
I'd turn my pony south, boys
And ride to Mexico
My pockets full of silver
To gamble or to lay
Cause I've been down before
But I won't be down again
But I ain't got no silver
No pony, no gun
All I got's this hammer
Like old John Henry swung
Been ten years on this chain gang
One more day, and then
I've been down before
But I won't be down again
Now standing on this rock pile
Of four and twenty men
Well I've been down before
But I won't be down again
I've been down before
But I won't be down again

I was in and out of Fort Roots since I came back from the war

The things we carry now
Every ounce added up
Can't seem to set them down
I can't seem to set 'em down

Did it follow from the old world? Had it been here all   along?
The banshee didn't seem to bother when it was wartime

49,How Many Times,Esther Rose,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/esther-rose/how-many-times-chords-3615086,"Standing in the shower 'til the heat runs out
Trash is on the corner where I put it out
Pills to take the pain
Take it all away
Dinner and a movie, scrape the bowl
I'm never hungry and I'm never full
They make pills to ease the pain
But that ain't the easy way
How many times will you break my heart?
How many times will you break my heart?
How many times will you break my heart?
How many times will you break my heart?
Walking through the Quarter with my hood pulled up
Don't you stand beside me boys I got bad luck
Prayers to ease the pain
But I feel it all the same
Thought I hit the bottom but I'm falling fast
Tell me why is it so hard to make a good thing last
Praying no more rain
Won't you spare a little change?
How many times will you break my heart?
How many times will you break my heart?
How many times will you break my heart?
How many times will you break my heart?
Putting on a record, it's my favorite song
Tell me why, tell me why did I wait so long
Where are you now?
Have you got it figured out?
Wrap your arms around me, you're my only home
Getting closer to the ground, turtle bone
I thought I heard a sound
But there's no one else around
How many times will you break my heart?
How many times will you break my heart?
How many times will you break my heart?
How many times, how many times will you break my heart?
Sha-la-la oooooooh
    Break my heart
Sha-la-la oooooooh
    Break my heart

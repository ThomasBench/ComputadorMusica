When you look my way

And I'm thinking the same
You got that something in your eyes, I think about it all the time
If you ever wonder if I wanna make you mine
Yeah, boy
Yeah, boy
But you're making it hard, I'm wishing your arms
Were wrapping me up tight
Yeah, boy
Yeah, boy
And if you wanna know if I wanna be your girl tonight
Yeah, boy
Every song that's playing gets me thinking about you, baby
And the way you roll
So let's put down the drop top, burn a little blacktop
Off of that road
Baby, what we waiting on?
The stars are out, the night is young
If you wanna know if I wanna go and get gone
Yeah, boy

1,Maybe A Moment,Justin Townes Earle,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/justin-townes-earle/maybe-a-moment-chords-2021219,"   Get in the car up front with me
Y'know there's nothing to do 'round here during the week
So we're going to Memphis to get out of town
   Going to Memphis to mess around
I got a bottle of Thunderbird in the trunk
I know a place if there's anything you want
This old man runs the store, he'll sell anything to anyone
But I don't know what time he closes up
   So think about it, but, baby, don't take too much time
Maybe only a moment,     maybe the time of your life
   Well, boys might look rough but they're not tough between me and you
   Though they can be crude
   Like the girl less thing's goin' on about
He just said: ""She's got a pretty mouth""
So you see...
What I'm dealing with
And how's the old saying go?
""With friends like this...""
   Don't worry we     all gotta be back by morning time
Maybe only a moment,      maybe the time of your life
    Come on,    baby, come on
Ain't you ever     stayed out all night long?
   I know your brother he don't scare me
   Why do we need to tell your momma anything?
   If I'm bothering you let me know
   But ain't we damn near grown?

That shines in the Mexico sun
There are boats and they cross from one side to the other
At dusk when the hot day is done
From there to Acuna to Del Rio, Texas
Uvalde up through San Antone
With the pesos I've saved up for years then I'll trade
For the chance to send dollars back home 
Coyote, coyote, que hiciste cabron?
Coyote, man what have you done?
You took all our money and left us to die
In the heat of the South Texas sun
Coyote, que hiciste cabron?
He steps out of the shadows, he won't look in my eyes
His hand's out to take all I've got
He says that he's smuggled a thousand good men
And he says that he's never been caught
So with seventeen other, braceros like cattle
Packed in for that long final ride
In the semi-truck crossing the border it's dark
And it's hot as an oven inside
Coyote, coyote, que hiciste cabron?
Coyote, man what have you done?
You took all our money and left us to die
In the heat of the South Texas sun
Coyote, que hiciste cabron?
The braceros are asking in whispers
Why the truck stopped in the heat of the day?
At first sign of trouble, he's left us all there
By the road and he's walking away
Coyote, coyote, que hiciste cabron?
Coyote, man what have you done?
You took all our money and left us to die
In the heat of the South Texas sun

Sometimes I can't believe that I'm still standing

Have some fun and try to play my music
Was all I really said I could do 
And if anybody asks me Joe how do you do it
Cause you do it with such style and grace
I just shake my head and smile 
Look 'em in the eyes and say 
I'm just lucky that way,  just lucky
Got a good woman and she makes me happy 
Most of the time I make her happy too 
We decided we should live together 
So we both said 'I do'
And when someone says Hey Joe, I saw you on TV 
And how do you know what to play 
I just shake my head and smile 
Look 'em in the eyes and say 
I'm just lucky that way 
Started in the middle of nowhere
I didn't have far to fall
There were times I thought it was the end of the world 
It didn't turn out so bad after all
Ya, I started in the middle of nowhere
I didn't have far to fall
And the times I thought it was the end of the world
Didn't turn out so bad after all
I'll let you all in on a little secret 
If I could share with you a thing or two 
If you just act like you know what you're doing 
Everybody thinks that you do
And when anybody asks me Joe, how do you do it

The deal was we would get to go, if we
Cleaned it up, and got it running,
Daddy's old Winnebago.
Wing and a prayer down 65,
Five best friends on four bald tires,
I can still see Billy smiling
When we finally made it.
To Talladega, boys raised up,
Whiskey in your glass, here's to turning up,
Slowing down and cars that go real fast,
We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,
Sure would like to stay in, Talladega. 
Like a storm, time rolls on,
You can't hit pause as we just did.
Most days in life don't stand out,
But life's about those days that will, like,
Rocking rando, getting rowdy,
Shooting roman candles at the man in the moon,
til the Alabama sun was breaking.
Over Talladega, boys raised up,
Whiskey in your glass, here's to turning up,
Slowing down and cars that go real fast,
We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,
Sure would like to stay in, Talladega.
When the winds go cold and it blows October,
I think about us shoulder to shoulder,
Like those cars my thoughts roll over and over and over,
In my mind.
Tonight I'm in Talladega, boys raised up,
Whiskey in your glass, here's to turning up,
Slowing down and cars that go real fast,
We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,

And a flower in her hand
That I picked from the side of Thomas Drive
On our way to the sand
We found an old wooden chair
Still warm from the sun
Pushed it back, gave me a kiss with Bacardi on her lips
And I was done
And we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted
Like an old beach roller coaster
The rest of those days
Turned into long crazy nights
When the music got loud
We'd sneak away from the crowd under the boardwalk lights
And with all the things we said
What I just can't get past
Is the way we let it end
Now I'm wonderin' where she is
Knowin' I can't get that goodbye back
When we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'
Would last longer than that week did
Blown away and barely breathin'
Sunday came and it was over
Now she's got me twisted

She's like a song playin' over and over
In my mind, where I still hold her
I had the chance and I should've told her
When we spent that week wide open
Upside down beside the ocean
I didn't know where it was goin'
Just tryin' to keep my heart on the tracks
I should've known that kind of feelin'

Now its climbing with a bullet.
Its nice to have someone, so honestly devoted,
But when it’s said and done,       girl I hope you know that,
The traveling, the singing, it don’t mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are  all  just second to,
This life, this love that you and I have been dreaming of, for so long
Would all be as good as gone, without you.
   Oh ho, without you,     hey…
Along comes a baby girl, and a suddenly my little world,
Just got a whole lot bigger, yes it did.
And people that I barely knew, love me ‘cause I’m part of you
Man it's tough to figure
How two souls can be, miles from one another
But still you and me,       have somehow found each other.
The traveling, the singing, it don’t mean nothing without you

That I could live this life,       just going through the motions
The traveling, the singing, it don’t mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are  all  just second to,
This life, this love that you and I have been building up  so  high,
It’s never gonna touch the sky, without you.

Build it move it
Flames can't touch how time will prove it
Watch us fly as loud as we can

Change what I am now.
Wouldn't it be fine to stand

Oh and you and I know all too well

Just like his daddy did, he joins the armed forces
Gonna be a man, oh not a zero
For Uncle Sam, well he'll be a hero
He don't know that Uncle Sam is a cartoon and not a man
Poor Joey White
Oh Joey White, you better bite your tongue
You don't know jack, boy
You're young, dumb and full of cum
Better step in line, go with the others
Gonna fight for freedom, son, your country and your brothers
Here's your boots and here's a gun
Poor Joey White
Well he got two years in the sand,
And it will surely change his plans for life
Joey White, well he gets his orders
Grab your things and we'll meet you at the border
Kill 'em all, no quarter given
Shoot on sight, boy, let God sort out the livin'
Told ya no one's keeping score
For Joey White
Yeah, from below and from the sky
Oh a scream of battle cry
Poor Joey White
Joey White, well you better run faster
You can't run fast enough to avoid this grave disaster
Well in a flash blood soaks his shirt
Drops to his knees, now he's face down in the dirt
Now he's on that freedom bird
Gets to leave this Hell on Earth still alive
Now his heart's filled up with lead

Than a fancy evening dress,
And with her windows rolled down and her hair all blown around,
She’s a hot southern mess...
She’ll take a beer over white wine
And a campfire over candle light,
And when it comes to love, oh her idea
Of a romantic night...
Is listening to old Alabama, driving through Tennessee,
A little Dixieland Delight at The Right Time Of The Night,
And she can’t keep her hands off of me
And now we’re rolling down an old back road,
I got the steering wheel in one hand,
We’ll find a hideaway where she and I can play,
In Mother Nature’s band...
Now we’re listening to old Alabama, parked somewhere in Tennessee,
A little Dixieland Delight and It Feels So Right,
And It’s Love In The First Degree
Forget about Sinatra or Coltrane,
Or some old Righteous Brothers song,
Hey even Barry White ain’t gonna work tonight,
If you really wanna turn her on,
Play some back home come on music that comes from the heart,
Play something with lots of feeling,
Cause that’s where music has to start.

And we're driving through Tennessee,
A little Dixieland Delight and It Feels So Right

It made the man I am today

Roots, remind me where I'm from
Even when I'm a thousand miles away from my roots
I'm home

At Dixie Tavern, playing with my band
We'd start the show with a round of whiskey
And play our hearts out and wished it'd never end
Ooh, I wouldn't change a thing
It made the man I am today
My roots always keep me grounded
Roots, remind me where I'm from
Even when I'm a thousand miles away from my roots

Then follow up with a cold beer on a Friday night
Always dreaming one day we'd play with
All our heroes we cover every night
Flying high all our dreams came true
You've given me wings
And roots, always keep me grounded

Trunk music and headlight fights
Dodging smoke from a riverbank fire
Pretty girl and a pickup line like
Hey whats your name, you know smoke follows beauty baby

Made our drinks too strong
Feeling ten feet tall
Rope swinging on the water
Like oh-oh-oh oh oh
Breaking our boots in
Stompin on the ground we grew up on
Yeah, we were raised on it
Worked hard and played on it
We had it made on it
We were born and raised on it
Car wash at the custom tent
Sticky quarters and pine tree scent
The only sign that we ever got stuck
5-1s with a 20 on top
Three guard at the barber shop
Duckin from your ex at the 4 way stop
Turn the music down when youre passing the cops

0,Pancho And Lefty (ver 4),Willie Nelson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/willie-nelson/pancho-and-lefty-chords-1460993,"Livin' on the road, my friend  
Was gonna keep you free and clean  
But now you wear your skin like iron
And your breath's as hard as kerosene 
You weren't your mama's only boy 
But her favorite one, it seems
She began to cry when you said ""good bye"" 
And sank into your dreams
Pancho was a bandit, boys 
His horse was fast as polished steel 
He wore his guns outside his pants 
For all the honest world to feel
Pancho met his match, you know 
On the deserts down in Mex-i-co 
Nobody heard his dyin' words 
Aw, but that's the way it goes
All the federales say 
They could have had him any day 
They only let him slip a-way 
Out of kindness, I suppose
Lefty he can't sing the blues 
All night long like he used to 
The dust that Pancho bit down South 
Ended up in Lefty's mouth
The day they laid old Pancho low 
Lefty split for O-hi-o 
Where he got the bread to go 
There ain't nobody knows
All the federales say 
They could've had him any day 
We only let him slip a-way 
Out of kindness, I suppose
Each of these represent about 1 measure, see the video at 2:48
Poets tell how Pancho fell 
An' Lefty's livin' in cheap hotels 
The desert's quiet and Cleveland's cold 
And so the story ends, we're told 
Pancho needs your prayers, it's true 
But save a few for Lefty, too
He only did what he had to do 
And now he's growin' old
All the federales say 
We could've had him any day 
Only let him go so long
Out of kindness, I suppose
A few gray federales say 
We could have had him any day 
We only let go so long
Out of kindness, I suppose

I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb.
I was soft inside, there was something going on.
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain, every beat of my heart
We got something going on.
Tender love is blind
All this love we feel needs no conversation.
We ride it together, uh huh
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between how can we be wrong?
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh.
I can't live without you if the love was gone
And you did walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing.
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing.
No more will you cry, baby I will hurt you never.
We start and end as one in love forever
We can ride it together, uh huh
Making love with each other, uh huh.
Islands in the stream

No one in between how can we be wrong?
Sail away with me to another world

The stairway to the subway and the shadows down below
Following the footsteps through the neon darkened corridors
Of silent desperation,never speaking to a soul
The poison air he's breathing has a dirty smell of dieing
Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain
Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes
Of the clicking of the turnstile and the rattle of his chains
""Oh"",she said ""Casey it's been so long since i've seen you""
""Here"",she said ""Just a kiss to make a body smile""
""See"",she said ""I've put on new stockings just to please you""

For something wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones
Seeing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men
Who reach for anything they can to keep from going home

Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by
He stumbles as he's leaving and he wonders if the reason
Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye

And I've gone cold turkey, cause there's not even one kiss a day

A silowet moves cross a cinnamon sky 
Riding along on a horse he calls music
With a song on his lips
And a tear in his eye
He dreams of a time
And a lady who loved him
And how he would sing her
Sweet lullabies
But we don’t ever ask him
And he never talks about her
I guess it’s just better 
That we all let it slide 
And he sings ohhhh to the lady’s 
And ohhhh he makes them sigh
Then he rides away 
On a horse he calls music
The pain in his heart 
And a tear in his eye
Now he wrote the music
From Boston to Bozmon
Not to much money
And way to much ride
But those were the days
When a horse he called music
The jump through the moon
And Flied across the sky
Now all that’s left
Is an old time worn cowboy
With only his dreams
Of the days gone gone by
And trailin behind
Is a horse with no rider
A horse he calls memories
That she used to ride
But he sang ohhhh
To the ladies 
And ohhhh he damn near made some fall right down and die
And he’d ride away
On a horse he called music
The pain in his heart
And a tear in his eye
High on a mountain in Western Montana
Two crosses cut through a cinnamon sky
Markin the place were 
A horse he called music
Lays with a cowboy
There by his side

Wild geese over the water, heading north and home again
Bringin' a warm wind from the south, bringin' the first taste of the spring
His mother took him to her breast and softly she did sing:
Oh, Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
His mother died that summer and he never learned to cry
He never knew his father and he never did ask why
He never knew the answers that would make an easy way
But he learned to know the wilderness and to be a man that way
His mother's brother took him in to his family and his home
Gave him a hand that he could lean on and a strength to call his own
And he learned to be a farmer and he learned to love the land
And he learned to read the seasons and he learned to make a stand
Oh, Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
On the eve of his 21st birthday, he set out on his own
He was 30 years and runnin' when he found his way back home
Ridin' a storm across the mountains and an achin' in his heart
Said he came to turn the pages and to make a brand new start
Now he never told the story of the time that he was gone
Some say he was a lawyer, some say he was a john
There was something in the city that he said he couldn't breathe
There was something in the country that he said he couldn't leave
Oh, Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
Now some say he was crazy and some are glad he's gone
But some of us will miss him and we'll try to carry on
Giving a voice to the forest, giving a voice to the dawn
Giving a voice to the wilderness and the land that he lived on
Oh, Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies

Our lives, are better left to chance. I could have missed the pain

Holding you I held everything.  For a moment wasn't I the king?

 And I was lookin' for a place to get myself out of the cold
 To warm the frozen feelin' that was eatin' at my soul
 And keep the chilly wind off my guitar
 My thirsty wanted whisky, my hungry needed beans
 But it'd been of month of paydays since I've heard that eagle scream
 So with my stomach full of empty and a pocket full of dreams
 I left my pride and stepped inside a bar
 Actually I guess you could call it a Tavern
 Cigarette smoke to the ceiling and sawdust on the floor
 Friendly shadows
  I saw that there was just one old man sittin' at the bar
  And in the mirror I could see him checkin' me and my guitar
  He turned and said ""Come up here boy and show us what you are""
  I said ""I'm dry"" and he brought me a beer
 He nodded at my guitar and said ""It's a tough life, ain't it""
 I just looked at him, and he said ""You ain't makin' any money, are ya?""
 I said ""You've been readin' my mail"". He just smiled and said 
 Let me see your guitar, I've got something you want to hear.
If you waste your time a talkin' to the people who don't listen
To the things that you are sayin', who do you think's gonna hear
And if you should die explaining how the things that they complain about
Are things they could be changin' who do you think's gonna care
There were other lonely singers in a world turned deaf and blind
Who were crucified for what they tried to show
And their voices have been scattered by the swirling winds of time
Cause the truth remains that no one wants to know
 Well, the old man was a stranger, but I'd heard his song before
 Back when failure had me locked out on the wrong side of the door
 When no one stood behind me but my shadow on the floor
 And lonesome was more than a state of mind
 You see, the devil haunts a hungry man
 If you don't wanna join him you got to beat him
 I ain't sayin' I beat the devil   but I drank his beer for nothing
     Then I stole his song
And you still can hear me singin' to the people who don't listen
To the things that I am sayin' prayin' someone’s gonna hear
And I guess I'll die explaining how the things that they complain about
Are things they could be changin' hopin' someone’s gonna care
I was born a lowly singer, and I'm bound to die the same
But I've got to feed the hunger in my soul
And if I never have a nickel I won't ever die ashamed
Cause I don't believe that no one wants to know

And the moon along the Gunnison don't rise
Shall I cast my dreams upon your love babe
And lie beneath the laughter of your eyes
It's snowin' on Raton, come morning
I'll be through them hills and gone
Ah Mother thinks the road is long and lonely
Little brother thinks the road is straight and fine
Well little darling thinks the road is soft and lovely
I'm thankful that old road's a friend of mine
It's snowin' on Raton, come morning
I'll be through them hills and gone
Ah, bid the years good-bye, you cannot still them
Well you cannot turn the circles of the sun
Well you cannot count the miles until you feel them
And you cannot hold a lover that is gone
It's snowin' on Raton, come morning
I'll be through them hills and gone
Well, tomorrow the mountains will be sleeping
Silent beneath a blanket green and blue
Ah that I shall hear the silence they are keeping
I'll bring all their promises to you
It's snowin' on Raton, come morning
I'll be through them hills and gone
It's snowin' on Raton, come morning
I'll be through them hills and gone
come morning, I'll be through them hills and gone

The people just walked on by as I cried 
The bottle had robbed him of all his rebel pride 
So I sang Dixie as he died  
He said way down yonder in the land of cotton 
Old times there ain't near as rotten as they are
On these damned ole L.A streets 
He drew his dying breath 
Laid his head against my chest  
Oh please lord take his soul back home to Dixie 
I sang Dixie as he died 
The people just walked on by as I cried 
The bottle had robbed him of all his rebel pride 
So I sang Dixie as he died  
He said listen to me son while you still can 
Run back home to that Southern land 
Don't you see what life here has done to me 
Then he closed those old blue eyes 
Fell limp against my side, no more pain 
Now his soul's back home in Dixie 
I sang Dixie as he died

The bottle had robbed him of all his rebel pride

And the hair around around his muzzle's turnin' grey.
He has seen a hundred musters,  And I think its only fair:
We leave him in the longyard here today.
He was broken in the sixties,  Maybe 63 or 4.
Never faltered always seemed to be on hand,
Never have I seen him beaten,  By a bullock in the bush,
And at night watch he was pick of all the land.
So leave him out there in the longyard,  Do not rush him.
Leave him out there with his mate, the baldy bay.
With his mates that he can graze, and He can laze with.
Leave him there and we will turn him out today.
Oh yes he's lookin' kinda jaded,  And his sight is not the best,
And the hair around around his muzzle's turnin' grey.
He has seen a hundred musters,
And I think its only fair:  We leave him in the longyard here today.
He's entitled to some kindness,   In return for all he's been.
Now he's failin' and his step is gettin' slow.
Let him squander his last summers    By the river with his mates,
In the paddock where the sweetest grasses grow.
So leave him out there in the longyard,  Do not rush him.
Leave him out there with his mate, the baldy bay.
Leave him out there till after smoko  And we'll catch him.
We'll pull his tail and turn him out today.
Yeah, leave him out there in the longyard,   Do not rush him.
Leave him out there with his mate, the baldy bay.
We'll pull his tail and turn him out today.
Yes we'll pull his tail and turn him out today.
Oh leave him there and we will turn him out today.

Someone gets started and someone resigns

Only take horses down memory lane
Everything passes what past will remain?

Some don't get any and some get too much

0,Drank My Wife Away,David Allan Coe,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/david-allan-coe/drank-my-wife-away-chords-2118599,"Lately I been drinkin? too much whiskey
I been, gettin? drunk now everyday
I can?t sober up, to face the heartache
Knowin? that I Drank My Wife Away
She told me to stop drinkin?, or she?d leave me
I never heard one word she tried to say
Instead of holdin? her, I held the bottle
Until I finally Drank My Wife Away
Just pour me, a double shot of whiskey
I?ll be here, till I drink up all my pay
Between Jim Beam, George Dickel, and Jack Daniel?s
I guess(think) I?ll finally Drank My Wife Away.
I been tryin? hard, to drowned my sorrow
Ever since that woman, went a stray
And the jukebox knows that I?m bound, and determined
To do my best to Drank My Wife Away.
Please don?t cut me off, or I?ll go crazy
I?ve lost, everything except my mind
Now I?ll give my car keys, to the barmaid
You can call me a cab, at closin? time.
I think I finally Drank My Wife Away

The cops all know your number Bars all know your name
After six straight months of drinkin', boy You're never gonna be the same
And I ain't seen the sunshine Since I don't remember when
I may not know where I'm goin' But I sure know where I've been
The sheriff he just watches Every move I make And one of these days
The local girls all act Like I just ain't their kind 
Paintin' on their precious nails And losin' their sweet minds
And I'd give half of Texas If I could find a friend
I may not know where I'm goin' But I sure know where I've been
Aah the coast is disappearing As they line up on the beach Doin' all those little things
Jim Beam by the fire Cocaine in the stash
Baseball bat on the floorboard Shotgun on the dash
And you might lose your mind Go walkin' round the bend
You may not know where you're goin' But you'll sure know where you been

5,Furr (ver 2),Blitzen Trapper,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/blitzen-trapper/furr-chords-765576,"Yeah, when I was only 17, 
I could hear the angels whispering
So I droned into the woods and 
wondered aimlessly about till
I heard my mother shouting through the fog
It turned out to be the howling of a dog
or a wolf to be exact
The sound sent shivers down my back
but I was drawn into the pack
And before long, they allowed me 
to join in and sing their song
So from the cliffs and highest hill, yeah
we would gladly get our fill,
howling endlessly and shrilly at the dawn. 
And I lost the taste for judging right from wrong. 
For my flesh had turned to fur, yeah 
And my thoughts, they surely were turned to 
instinct and obedience to God. 
You can wear your fur
like the river on fire.
But you better be sure
if your makin' God a liar. 
I'm a rattlesnake, babe,
I'm like fuel on fire.
So if you're gonna' get made,
don't be afraid of what you've learned.        
On the day that I turned 23, 
I was curled up underneath a dogwood tree. 
When suddenly a girl 
with skin the color of a pearl, 
wandered aimlessly, 
but she didn't seem to see. 
She was listenin' for the angels just like me. 
So I stood and looked about.
I brushed the leaves off of my snout. 
And then I heard my mother shouting through the trees. 
You should have seen that girl go shaky at the knees. 
So I took her by the arm
we settled down upon a farm. 
And raised our children up as 
gently as you pleased.
And now my fur has turned to skin.
And I've been quickly ushered in 
to a world that I confess I do not know.
But I still dream of running careless through the snow.
An' through the howlin' winds that blow,
across the ancient distant flow,
it fill our bodies up like water till we know.

Cause I’m still trying to figure it out
Don’t know what’s down this road, I’m just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I’m not the only one
Who feels the way I do
I’m alone, on my own, and that’s all I know
I’ll be strong, I’ll be wrong, oh but life goes on
I’m just a girl, trying to find a place in
This world
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I’m wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow’s just a mystery, oh yeah
But that’s ok
I’m alone, on my own, and that’s all I know
I’ll be strong, I’ll be wrong, oh but life goes on

I'm five years old 
It's getting cold outside, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh 
And look up at smilin at you, I run and run 
Past the pumpkin patch 
And the tractor rides, Look now, the sky is gold 
I hug your legs 
And fall asleep on the way home 
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall 
I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today 
I'm 13 now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean 
I come home crying
And you hold me tight and grab the keys 
And we drive and drive 
Until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 
'til I've forgotten all their names 
[Chorus]
I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughin on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today 
I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger 
God smiles on my little brother 
Inside and out, he's better than I am...
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you 
There is a video 
I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set 
in the kitchen and you're talkin to me 
It's the age of princesses 
and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs 
Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world 
Now I know why the all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes, staying back and watching me shine 
And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm takin this chance to say
I had the best day with you today

I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go-o-o"", and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all therе's left to do is run
You'll be the princе and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say..
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go-o-o"", and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

Soft and pretties on a hardwood floor

And either way you'll find me chasing strays

Dance 'til you're sweating like a rented mule
Getting loud with all my cowboy friends

Do a little more  service and repair

And offer up another chance
For a little bit more  service and repair 
A little bit more  service and repair

At sowing the dreams that suited for both soul and soil

Make sure she knows you love her well

To something and not away from

A man could do is draw a hungry crowd
Tell everyone his name, pride, and 
Confidence but leaving out his doubt

Much to anyone as they now mean to me

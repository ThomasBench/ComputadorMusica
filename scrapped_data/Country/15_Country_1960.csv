Fairest skin with eyes of blue
I swear to the Lord that I loved her true
It's a year now she's been gone
Well her spirit was as bright as the soft sunshine
Lips, the colour strawberry wine
I wish to God, she still was mine
The chance won't come again
After first, we lay in love's sweet bed
With one look at her eyes, I might have read
All the pain that was flying through her head
Through my guilt I could not see
Oh I turned to her when the morning came
Hungry thoughts racing through my brain
But the knife in her heart screamed herself she'd slain
And a note whispered love too soon
Her old man screamed and her mother cried
All I could do was to wonder why
A girl in her youth was forced to die
Is loving such a crime?
She died Few in years with breasts still small
Seeing sixteen summers and fifteen falls
Me and my blindness never realized all
The fear she kept inside
Let me tell you a story 'bout a girl I knew
Fairest skin with eyes of blue
I swear to the Lord that I loved her true

1,In The Ghetto,Dolly Parton,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/dolly-parton/in-the-ghetto-chords-1758477,"As the snow flies 
On a cold and gray Chicago morn
A poor little baby child is born in the ghetto 
Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another little hungry mouth to feed in the ghetto
People can't you understand the child needs a helping hand
He'll grow to be an angry young man someday
Take a look at you and me are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads and look the other way 
While the world turns 
A hungry little boy with a running nose
Plays in the streets as the cold wind blows in the ghetto 
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight in the ghetto
And then one night in desperation the young man breaks away
And he buys a gun and he steals a car tries to run but don't get far 
And his momma cries 
As a crowd gathers round an angry young man
Paces down the street with a gun in his hand in the ghetto 
On a cold and gray Chicago morn 
Another little baby child is born in the Ghetto

There’s a big old hole, in Tiger Mountain.
God, help the man, who gets lost, in Miller’s Cave.
I had me a girl, in Waycross, Georgia, but she had unfaithful ways
She made me feel, I was unwanted,
Like the bats, and the bears in Miller’s Cave.
I caught her out, Sunday morning, with some guy, they call Big Dave,
The meanest man, in Waycross, Georgia.
I’d rather fight a mountain lion, in Miller’s Cave.
So I said, you’re gonna pay; both you and Dave,
Cause I’m gonna see you in your grave.
Then they laughed at me; then I shot them.
Then dragged their cheating, skin and bones, to Miller’s Cave.
I couldn’t stand, the way she did me.  Well, I guess I showed her, I was brave.
“Most Wanted Man” in the state of Georgia,  
They’re never gonna find me cause I’m lost, in Miller’s Cave.
They’re never gonna find me cause I’m lost,    in Miller’s Cave.

Ten pretty women, to sing me a song

Now I'm working my hands in soil tryin' to pay my due

Just shovel a little good earth over my head 
Till everybody open up the hymn book and sing a happy song 
Shall we gather at the river in the sweet by and by

I said shove off honey baby I ain't grievin'
Pack your bags and pull out this evenin'
There's a wide open road
Early this mornin' you were nowhere about
And so I searched the town but you had done pulled out
I looked north east and west and then a-leadin' south
I saw a wide open road
It's leadin' south from my abode
If you stick around then turn your damper down
Or there's a wide open road
Was to tell you that your kitty-cat he's still around
And you left your weddin' ring when you went down
That wide open road
If you're gonna stay away then honey let me know
How to cook hot biscuits how to roll the dough
Everything's gone crazy since I told you to go 
Down the wide open road
And honey I want you to know
You can look down south or you can turn back home
And there's a wide open road

I just kept right on goin'
Until it got back to you
I let my mind wander
Can't trust it one minute
It's worse than a child
This old face without conscience
And it's driving me wild
When I let my mind wander
I try to keep my mind busy
With thoughts of today but
But invariably memories
Seem to lure it away
My lonely heart wonders
If there'll ever come a day
When I can be happy
But I can't see no way

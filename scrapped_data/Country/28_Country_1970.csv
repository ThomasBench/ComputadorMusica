Wave at me through that window pane
Left me with my arms full of empty
Well I'm so sick and tired of getting up so sick and tired
Sick old dirty clothes and dirty dishes
I'm tired of all these sleepless nights that drive me up to walls
Tired of having arms full of empty
Done me wrong and that ain't funny
Left me standing here a looking silly
Jump aboard that silver plane
Wave to me through the window pane
Left me with my arms full of empty
I promise you that I won't be mad
For I never was one to hold grudges
I ain't had no tender loving care since you've been gone
I've only had two arms full of empty

We think we have a secret - but it always shows

I'll tell you about a minstrel band
Of children in their witches hats
Painting pictures with the pipes of pan
How a young boy and his sister played some tunes
Upon a whistle made of tin
And led me through the flower gardens
Laughing at the postman's stubby chin
And in my dizzy stupor
I was trying to forfeit all I'd known
And listen to that french horn music
that could swirl me in a magic all it's own
But somewhere in the distance
You and I, we fought our monsters to a draw
It was in those days of books and wine
With Ferlin Getty grasping for a straw
And out along the highways
We journeyed far to find that mystic smile
Chasing down identities
My God we must have run a million miles
So we can teach the children
Nothing, nothing but survival in the desert bare
They can teach us how to laugh
How to love and tie bright ribbons in our hair
So play for us you children
Tinkle bells and rhyme the purple, greens and blues
Think of us as fighting fools
Who somehow stumbled through this life loving you
Lets sing children sing
Love all the purples greens and blues
we'll all think over
how we wintered through the seasons loving you

Why does it have to end so soon, please stay 'til the morning light
It's such a long way home, and you'd only be alone
Ah, come on now, why don't you spend the night?
Maybe I spoke too soon and maybe my timing's wrong
Or maybe it's something I shouldn't have said at all
But when I look in your eyes, I feel like we're almost one
Ah, something tells me the night's only just begun.
Why don't you spend the night? Somehow it seems so right

There's a bright there's a sunny side too
Though we meet with the darkness and strife
The sunny side we also may view 
Keep on the sunny side always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day it will brighten all the way
If we'll keep on the sunny side of life
Let us greet with the song of hope each day
Though the moment be cloudy or fair
Let us trust in our Savior away
Who kept everyone in His care
Keep on the sunny side always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day it will brighten all the way
If we'll keep on the sunny side of life
The storm and its fury broke today
Crushing hopes that I cherish so dear
Storms and clouds will in time pass away
The sun again will shine bright and clear
Keep on the sunny side always on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day it will brighten all the way
If we'll keep on the sunny side of life

Willie Nelson's gettin' grey and Faron Young don't care
But the young ones keep on coming on the old are slow to go
Let there be country and let the country grow
Let there be country let the music roll along
Let there be country and let me share the song
No one picks like Bill Monroe and don't George Jones sing great
I can tell that the people care by the people at my gate
Webb Pierce invites the tourists in and Ray keeps them away
Let there be country and let the country play
Let there be country let the music roll along
Let there be country and let me share the song
Ernest Tubb's got all of the soul he's had for all these years
Porter Wagoner's recitation still bring me to tears
And when they do play Kitty Wells you know she's still the Queen
Let there be country and keep the country green
Let there be country let the music roll along
Let there be country and let me share the song
Little Jimmy Dickens still sends shivers through the crowd
Mother Maybelle whispers now but the heart comes through real loud
Gene Autry don't sing no more good old Tex Ritter's gone
And somewhere downtown Nashville a young man just got off the bus
With a guitar in his hands a pocket full of songs
A lot of talent and a heart full of hope
And he's gonna be the next big country star and the country wheels roll on
Let there be country let the music roll along
Let there be country and let me share the song
Let there be country let the music roll along

Her beauty seemed just like a breath of spring,
And when I looked into her eyes I thought of bluish summer skies,
And when I held her hand in mine I heard the bluebirds sing.
They sang of wondering (Wondering if he loves her)
Will she marry  (Marry if he asks her)
Will her heart beat (Heart beat true for him for} then and ever-more,
And when she's lonely (Lonely is he near her}
When there's sadness (Sadness will he cheer her)
Will they always (Always be together) Until in death they part.
I courted her for months on end until she promised we would wed,
We planned on being married in the spring,
All through the long cold winter months it seemed that spring would never come,
And every gloomy winter's day I heard the bluebirds sing.
They sang of waiting (Waiting for the flowers)
And of counting (Counting every hour)
Till the bluebird (Bluebird chirps his welcome) Into the world once more,
And though we're waiting  (Waiting for the sunshine)
We keep hating  (Hating every storm-cloud)
That has gathered  (Gathered over the mountains) To keep us far apart.
And when at last spring touched the earth, We were married in the church,
Our wedding seemed just like a dream come true,
Tho many years have come and gone, Our love is still as true and strong,
As when I found her long ago and still the bluebird sings.
He sang of loving  (Loving every hour)
That I'm married  (Married to my flower)
And we're happy (Happy ever after) As since the day we met,
And though we're older  (Older love is sweeter)
We grow fonder  (Fonder of each other)
We'll be sweethearts (Sweethearts close together) Until the end of time.

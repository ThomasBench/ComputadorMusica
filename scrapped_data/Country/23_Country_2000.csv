0,Satisfied Mind,Willie Nelson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/willie-nelson/satisfied-mind-chords-1442799,"How many times have you heard someone say?
if I had his money I would do things my way
But little they know that it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.
Once I was wading in fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed for to get a start in life's game,
Then suddenly it happened, I lost every dime.
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.
Money can't buy back your youth when you're old
or A friend when you're lonely or a love that's grown cold.
The wealthiest person is a pauper at times
Compared to the man with a satisfied mind.
When my life has ended, and my time has run out
My friends and my loved ones will weep, there's no doubt.
But one thing for certain, when it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.

1,Believe,Brooks & Dunn,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/brooks-dunn/believe-chords-390571,"Old man Wrigley lived in that white house
Down the street where i grew up
Momma used to send me over with things
We struck a friendship up
I spent a few long summers out on his old porch swing
Says he was in the war when in the navy
Lost his wife, lost his baby
Broke down and asked him one time
How ya keep from going crazy
I asked him what he meant
He looked at me and smiled, said
I raise my hands, bow my head
I'm finding more and more truth in the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life than just what i can see
Oh i believe
Few years later i was off at college 
Talkin' to mom on the phone one night
Getting all caught up on the gossip
The ins and outs of the small town life
She said oh by the way son, old man Wrigley's died.
Later on that night, i laid there thinkin' back
Thought 'bout a couple long-lost summers
I didn't know whether to cry or laugh
If there was ever anybody deserved a ticket to the other side
I raise my hands, bow my head
I'm finding more and more truth in the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life than just what i can see
I can't quote the book
You can't tell me it all ends
You know I'm more and more convinced
The longer that i live
Yeah, this can't be
No, this can't be
No, this can't be all there is
When I raise my hands, bow my head
I'm finding more and more truth in the words written in red
Oh, I

Underneath the city lights
There walking with your friend, laughing at the moon
I swear you looked right through me
But Im still living with your goodbye
And youre just going on with your life
How can you just walk on by
Without one tear in your eye
Dont you have the slightest feelings left for me?
Maybe thats just your way of dealing with the pain
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall
Like we never loved at all
You, I hear youre doing fine, seems like youre doing well
As far as I can tell
Time is leaving us behind, another week has passed
And still I havent laughed yet
So tell me, what your secret is
To letting go, letting go like you did, like you did
    Did you forget the magic?
    Did you forget the passion? ohhh
    And did you ever miss me, ever long to kiss me?
Maybe thats just your way of dealing with the pain
Forgetting everything between our rise and fall
Like we never loved at all (at all)

Hey I was smokin' morphine 'til it knocked me off my feet
Then I scored some H from my old Uncle Pete
Now I'm startin' to feel like I might've OD'd.
On an overdose of drugs overdose of sin
And I love gettin' high hate bein' low
And I like to drive my truck down a muddy dirt road
And I'm workin' real hard tryin' to get paid
Cause I'm a Crazed Country Rebel and I’m driftin’ state to state.
Somehow I made it up to Texas with a carload full of grass
And I'm always livin' hard always smokin' weed
Now I'm hangin' out in Texas drinkin' mushroom tea
And I'm fucked up on the floor think I know why
Must've been some of that Boone County moonshine.
And an overdose of drugs, overdose of sin
And I love gettin' high hate bein' low
And I'm always about stayin' on this road
And I'm workin' real hard tryin' to get paid
Cause I'm a Crazed Country Rebel and I'm driftin' state to state.
I had to get up off the floor tried to get myself in line
That's why they call me Full Throttle I like a good time
It all started at a bar with a friend of mine
Well she had to hook me up he said he'd blow my mind
I've been up for four days so cut me out another line.

He lived and He died to buy my pardon
An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives
Because He lives I can face tomorrow
Because He lives all fear is gone
Because I know  He holds the future
My life is worth the living
Just because He lives
Then one day I'm gonna cross that river
I'm gonna fight life's fi-nal life’s final war with pain
And then as death someday gives way to victory
I'm gonna see those lights of glory and know that my Savior reigns

I stopped off in a no named town to grab a bite to eat
And the ceiling fans they hung’d above a screened in patio
Crawfish hotter than a chimney fire the beer was cheap and cold
And the bar maid smiled that kind of smile that knocked me off my stool
Said hang around I’ll show you things they don’t teach in school
Across the way an old blues man was playin’ on the street
He moaned just like a black and tan, I found myself a seat
He sang ‘Lord He lives above us’ and ‘the devil sleeps beneath’
Well he growled it mean and low between his three or four gold teeth
And I wished I was in Shreveport just a gamblin’ like a fool
Well you can learn somethings down there they don’t teach in school
Well I dreamed that night of a pretty girl, I dreamed of a river boat
‘Till a man in blue kicked at my shoes said come on boy, lets go
I said, oh officer, oh officer, please don’t take me to jail
Said you can’t sleep outside now my hands are tied, I knew that feelin’ all too well 
And if you play in my town son you’ll play it by the rules
That downtown night shed light on sights that you won’t see in school
Out of Jail I found myself a-walkin’ down the road
So glad to hear that ole Jake Brake come purrin’ nice and slow
Said I’m goin as far as Fayetteville, I’ve got some room to spare
Could you drop me off at Fort Smith, Sir, well I’ve got family there
And he bought the Jack on that big black Mack, kickin’ back I played it cool

For a case of beer and a tank of gasoline
I took a swing at my old man one Christmas
I never dreamed that it would be his last
I wish mom had rung my neck when she caught me with those cigarettes
Which reminds me, I'm down to my last pack
If I had a dime, for half the things I did
That didn't make no sense at all,
I'd be livin' a little higher on the hog
If only I'd a known, that later on down the road
I'd look back and not like what I see
I'd a changed a lot of things, startin' with me
I called my brother everything I could think of
The night he wouldn't bail me out of jail
I lost a job most folks 'round here would die for
By layin' out all night and raisin' hell
I let a woman that I love slip through my fingers
Chalk another dumb move up to my foolish pride
I wasn't there standin' by the bed, when the preacher bowed his head
With the family, the day my grandma died

My day would not be wasted on this drive
I want so bad to hold you, but son there's things I haven't told you
Your mom and me just couldn't get along
So I drive, and I think about my life,
And wonder why, that I slowly die inside
Every time I turn that truck around, right at the Georgia line
I count the days, and the miles back home to you, on that Highway 20 ride.
A day might come you'll realize, and if you see through my eyes
There was no other way to work it out
And a part of you might hate me, but son please don't mistake me
For a man who didn't care at all.
And I drive, and I think about my life,
And wonder why, that I slowly die inside

I hope you'll smile, if I ever cross your mind

Soon find something different to try
And when there is only a ringin' in your ears

See the new pyramids down in old Manhattan
From the roof of a friend's I watched an empire ending
Heard it loud and long the river's Om
Time marching on to a madman's drum
Don't forget what you've learned all you give is returned
And if life seems absurd what you need is some laughter
And a season to sleep and a place to get clean
Maybe Los Angeles, somewhere no one's expecting
On a detox walk through a Glendale Park over sidewalk chalk
Someone wrote in red, ""start over""
So I muffled my scream on an Oxnard beach
Full of fever dreams that scare you sober
Into saltless dinners
Take the fruit from the tree, break the skin with your teeth
Is it bitter or sweet? All depends on your timing
Like a meeting of chance with the train station glance
Many lifetimes had past in a instant reminded
Of a millstone house in a seaside town
When your heart gave out in a mission bed
So your wife gave birth to a funeral dirge
As you woke up purged as a wailing infant
In Krug Thep, Thailand
Hear the chimes, did you know that the wind when it blows
It is older than Rome and our joy and our sorrow

With nothing left to pack
Billy: Aint no room for me in that car
Even if she asks me to tag along

Before she hits that open road
Baby get ready get set don’t go
Miley: Looks like things are fallin in place

I painted this big old smile on my face
To hide my broken heart, if only she knew

Billy: This is where I want to but I wont get in the way
Of her in her dreams and spreading her wings

He sat down in his overalls, and asked me,
You waitin on a woman,
 I nodded yes n' how bout you,
He said son since 1952, I've been,
Waitin on a woman
When I picked her up for our first date,
I told her I'd be there at eight,
And she came down the stairs at 8:30,
She said I'm sorry that I took so long,
Didn't like a thing that I tried on,
 But let me tell you son she sure looked pretty,
Yea she'll take her time,    but I don't mind,
Waitin on a woman
And I don't guess we'd been anywhere
She hasn't made us late I swear,
Sometimes she does it just cause she can do it,
Boy it's just a fact of life,
it's be the same with your young wife,
Might as well go on and get used to it,
she'll take her time,    cause you don't mind,
Waitin on a woman
I've read somewhere statistics show,
The mans always the first to go,
And that makes sense cause I know she won't be ready,
So when it finally comes my time,
And I get to the other side,
I'll find myself a bench if they got any,
I hope she takes her time,     cause I don't mind,

The taxi's waiting, he's blowing his horn
Already I'm so lonesome I could die
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
I'm leaving on a jet plane

There's so many times I've let you down
So many times I've played around
 I tell you now they don't mean a thing
Every place I go I'll think of you
Every song I sing I'll sing for you
When I come back I'll bring your wedding ring
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go
I'm leaving on a jet plane

Now the time has come to leave you
One more time let me kiss you
Then close your eyes I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come
When I won't have to leave alone
About the times I won't have to say

There's lots of things along the road I'd surely like to see
I'd like to lean into the wind and tell myself I'm free
But your softest whispers louder than the highway's call to me
Close Your Eyes I'll Be Here In The Mornin'
Close your eyes I'll be here for awhile.
All the mountains and the rivers and the valleys can't compare
To your bluely dancin' eyes and yellow shinin' hair
I could never hit the open road and leave you lyin' there
Close Your Eyes I'll Be Here In The Mornin'
Close your eyes I'll be here for awhile.
Aw lay your head back easy love and close your cryin' eyes
I'll be layin' here beside you when the sun comes on the rise
And I'll stay as long as the cuckoo wails and the lonesome Blue Jay cries.
Close Your Eyes I'll Be Here In The Mornin'
Close your eyes I'll be here for awhile
Close Your Eyes I'll Be Here In The Mornin'
Close your eyes I'll be here for awhile

13,A Boy Named Sue (ver 2),Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/a-boy-named-sue-chords-501978,"My daddy left home when I was three
And he didn't leave much to ma and me
Just this old guitar and an empty bottle of booze.
Now, I don't blame him cause he run and hid
But the meanest thing that he ever did
Was before he left, he went and named me ""Sue.""
Well, he must o' thought that is quite a joke
And it got a lot of laughs from a' lots of folk,
It seems I had to fight my whole life through.
Some gal would giggle and I'd get red
And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head,
I tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named ""Sue.""
Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean,
My fist got hard and my wits got keen,
I'd roam from town to town to hide my shame.
But I made a vow to the moon and stars
That I'd search the honky-tonks and bars
And kill that man who gave me that awful name.
Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-July
And I just hit town and my throat was dry,
I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew.
At an old saloon on a street of mud,
There at a table, dealing stud,
Sat the dirty, mangy dog that named me ""Sue.""
Well, I knew that snake was my own sweet dad
From a worn-out picture that my mother'd had,
And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye.
He was big and bent and gray and old,
And I looked at him and my blood ran cold
And I said: ""My name is 'Sue!' How do you do!
Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes
And he went down, but to my surprise,
He come up with a knife and cut off a piece of my ear.
But I busted a chair right across his teeth
And we crashed through the wall and into the street
Kicking and a' gouging in the mud and the blood and the beer.
I tell ya, I've fought tougher men
But I really can't remember when,
He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile.
I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss,
He went for his gun and I pulled mine first,
He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile.
And he said: ""Son, this world is rough
And if a man's gonna make it, he's gotta be tough
And I knew I wouldn't be there to help ya along.
So I give ya that name and I said goodbye
I knew you'd have to get tough or die
And it's the name that helped to make you strong.""
He said: ""Now you just fought one hell of a fight
And I know you hate me, and you got the right
To kill me now, and I wouldn't blame you if you do.
But ya ought to thank me, before I die,
For the gravel in ya guts and the spit in ya eye
Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you ""Sue.'""
I got all choked up and I threw down my gun
And I called him my pa, and he called me his son,
And I came away with a different point of view.
And I think about him, now and then,
Every time I try and every time I win,

And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on

at the four gray walls that surround me

dusty, Delta day
I was out chopping cotton, and my
brother was bailing hay,
And at dinner time we stopped and walked
And Momma hollered out the back door
And then she said, I got some news this
Today  Billie Joe MacAllister jumped off
 the Tallahatchie Bridge.
And Poppa said to Momma as he passed
around the blackeyed peas
 Well Billie Joe never had
 a lick of sense pass the biscuits
 please
""There's five more acres in the lower forty
And Momma said it was shame ...a – bout
Seems like nothing ever comes to no good up
And now Billie Joe McAllister jumped off
The Tallahatchie Bridge.
And Brother said he recollected...when he
and Tom, and Billie Joe
Put a frog down my back at the Carroll
County Picture Show
And, ""Wasn't I talkin' to him
I'll have a-nother piece of apple pie
I saw him at the sawmill yesterday up on
And now you tell me Billie Joe's jumped off
the Tallahatchie Bridge.
Momma said to me ""Child” what's happened
To your appe - tite
haven't touched a single bite.
That nice young preacher Brother Taylor
Said he'd be pleased to have dinner on
He said he saw a girl that looked a lot
And she and Billie Joe was throwing
Something  off the Tallahatchie Bridge.
A year has come and gone since we heard the
News bout Billie Joe
Brother married Becky Thompson they
Bought a store in Tupe-lo,
There was a virus going round Poppa caught
it and he died last Spring. And now Momma
And me, I spend a lot of time pickin
And drop them into the muddy water off the
Tallahatchie Bridge.

And a blind man with his knife in hand
has convinced himself that he understands
I wish him well, Miss Carousel,
but I gotta be a-going
  Won't you come and get me when
You're sure that you don't need me then
I'll stand outside your window
and proudly call your name
Well, the lady's been told that all the gold
is worth so much it can't be sold
No time to weep, she'll need her sleep tomorrow
When she carries her face to the market place
and bets it on the opening race
She can ring her bells, Miss Carousel,

is shown that grown men never run
And so they fight with all the might inside them

that the trick is just not being caught
Will you give 'em hell, Miss Carousel,
when they're begging you to hide them
  Won't you come and get me when
You're sure that you don't need me then

You clamped your fingers 'round your nose

to kill him in the first degree

if you had something to begrudge him
On a velvet beach far beneath the reach
of those who come to pry and preach
The natural man that tried to stand is falling

you own his legs but his mind is free
Only you can tell, Miss Carousel,
how long will he be crawling

Seems there ain't no hope at all
to reach the top even though you stopped for breathing
But I ain't gonna try to make you cry,
the teardrops couldn't find your eyes

Daddy sang bass, mama sang tenor

One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm gonna join the family circle at the throne. ...

You could hear us singin' for a country mile
Now little brother has done gone on but I'll rejoin him in a song
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while.

As I walked out in Laredo one day
I spied a young cowboy, wrapped all in white linen
Wrapped in white linen, as cold as the clay
Oh, beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly
Sing the Death March as you carry me along
Take me to the valley, there lay the sod o'er me
I'm a young cowboy and know I've done wrong
I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy
These words he did say as I boldly walked by
Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story
Got shot in the breast and I know I must die
Go fetch me some water a cool cup of water
To cool my parched lips then the poor cowboy said
Before I returned his spirit had left him
Had gone to his maker the cowboy was dead
Oh, beat the drum slowly and play the fife lowly
Sing the Death March as you carry me along
Take me to the valley, there lay the sod o'er me
I'm a young cowboy and know I've done wrong

You fool it's only moonlight

Your hands'll turn to butter
Better leave this dream alone
Try to find another

And called the devil partner
Wisdom burned upon a shelf

Seal the river at its mouth
Take the water prisoner
Fill the sky with screams and cries
Bathe in fiery answer

Love his only concept
Strangers cry in foreign tongues 
And dirty up the doorstep
And I for one and you for two
Ain't got the time for outside

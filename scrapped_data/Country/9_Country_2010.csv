0,Half A Song,Cody Johnson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/cody-johnson/half-a-song-chords-1872853,"The band was startin' Slowhand
About the time you walked in 
I could see it in your eyes 
You were heart broke and needin' a friend 
The singer started singin' 
As I let you have my barstool 
And before that first chorus was through 
You were already smilin' 
I said no use in tryin'
Open up a tab, oh girl I'm gladly buyin'
Ain't it funny thinkin' 
You were thinkin' you be drinkin' alone 
Baby ain't it crazy what can happen 
In half a song 
The second verse started 
I asked you if you'd like to dance 
When you said no 
I figured well there goes my chance 
But the singer kept on singin' 
And before he hit that chorus again 
I felt you grab my hand,
Then we bee-lined to the floor 
Like we'd done this before,
Holdin' onto you one, two, three four.
Spinnin' and a gettin' in a rhythm, 
Girl it didn't take long
Baby ain't it crazy what can happen 
In half a sooooooong 
When that song ended, 
We said we've only got one more, 
Now we're half way through it
And we're still out here on the floor
Wonder what you're thinkin' 
'Cause I think I'd like to drive you home, 
But I know that's probably never gonna happen, 
I'll just settle for your number on a napkin
Then again you never know what could happen 
In half a song, 
In half a song

1,Children Of Children,Jason Isbell,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jason-isbell/children-of-children-chords-1756414,"Pictures of the farm before us
Old men in a gospel chorus
Sepia and saddle horses
Easy on the reins
Eighty-one, a motor-inn
Your momma's seventeen again
She's squinting at at the dusty wind
The anger of the plains
You and I were almost nothing
Pray to God the gods were bluffing 
Seventeen ain't old enough to reason with the pain
How could we expect the two to stay in love,
When neither knew the meaning of
The difference between sacred and profane?
I was riding on my mother's hip
She was shorter than the corn
And all the years I took from her
Just by being born
I didn't mean to break the cycle
At seventeen, I went by Michael 
No one ever called me by my own name anyway
Five full generations living
All these expectations giving way to one
So late to have a baby on the way
You were riding on your mother's hip
She was shorter than the corn
And all the years you took from her
Just by being born

I burned my own damn finger poking someone else's fire 
I've never gotten taller making someone else feel small
If you ain't got nothing nice to say don't say nothing at all

Smoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies
Mend your own fences and own your own crazy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
Nobody's perfect, we've all lost and we've all lied
Most of us have cheated the rest of us have tried
The holiest of the holy even slip from time to time
We've all got dirty laundry hanging on the line
So hoe your own row and raise your own babies
Smoke your own smoke and grow your own daisies
Mend your own fences and own your own crazy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
Mind your own biscuits and life will be gravy
Pouring salt in my sugar won't make yours any sweeter
Pissing in my yard ain't gonna make yours any greener
I wouldn't know about the rocks in your shoes
So I'll just do me and honey you can just do you

The deal was we would get to go, if we
Cleaned it up, and got it running,
Daddy's old Winnebago.
Wing and a prayer down 65,
Five best friends on four bald tires,
I can still see Billy smiling
When we finally made it.
To Talladega, boys raised up,
Whiskey in your glass, 
here's to turning up, slowing down 
and cars that go real fast,
We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,
Sure would like to stay in, 
Talladega.
Like a storm, time rolls on,
You can't hit pause as we just did.
Most days in life don't stand out,
But life's about those days that will, like,
Rocking rando, getting rowdy,
Shooting roman candles at the man in the moon,
til the Alabama sun was breaking.
Over Talladega, boys raised up,
Whiskey in your glass, 
here's to turning up, slowing down 
and cars that go real fast,
We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,
Sure would like to stay in, 
Talladega.
When the winds go cold and it blows October,
I think about us shoulder to shoulder,
Like those cars my thoughts roll over and over and over,
In my mind
Tonight i'm in Talladega, boys raised up,
Whiskey in your glass, 
here's to turning up, slowing down 
and cars that go real fast,
We were laughing and living, drinking and wishing,
And thinking as that checkered flag was waving,

Took her cat and left LA

With good whiskey in their head

  Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
  Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
  I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody but the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rockin' like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pouring Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
  It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain

  We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
  I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake

Maybe this time I will find my one and only
Got an angel on my left
Got the devil on my right
Says look who's back up on the scene
So I duck in to a dive
Two tens and a fiveâs all I got on me
I sit down for a spell
For the money
A sin for a sin
Don't know if I'll stay long
Seems like a damn good place to start 
Singing ba bada ba bada ba bada ba
The sun crashes into night
His red eyes on me
Says his name Jesus
And coming for me
I order one more round
Start thinking to myself
This is a place you'll never leave
Singing ba bada ba bada ba bada ba
He's heading for the door
Like an angel
Crown of thorns goes up in flames
Laughing and deranged like the devil
Collapses at the Jukebox
Cries the last call to heaven
Was in nineteen eighty three

And these days, I show off my scars
With one arm around my baby
And one arm around my boys

And a head that hates the noise
If the world comes knocking
Tell 'em I'm not home
I'm finally holdin' my own
I've burned up the fast lane
Dodging drugs and divorce
If I'm proof of anything
God sure loves Troubadours
Sometimes, late at night
I miss the smoke and neon
Sneak out of bed, grab a six-string
Play what's still turnin' me on
Like that tight old-time rock and roll
Or that right-down-home country gold
I miss blues and soul
But not more than I miss being home

Pipe to his chin

Could talk here's

Let me touch your cheek
I will always love you
Having your face hit
Having your lip split
By the one who loves you
Real love, real love
Real love makes your lungs black
Real love is a heart attack
Showing your mother
To any other, letting them touch her
Looking up to her, watching her do her makeup and hair
Real love, real love
Real love makes your lungs black
Real love is a heart attack
Cry like a bird, fly like a baby
Mamma got drunk and daddy went crazy
If your speech slurs, if you feel shaky, meet me out back
I'll be there waiting
Riding in the back seat
Watching the spit fly and the hummingbird cry
O mamma, o papa
O mamma, o papa
How much blood is worth the draw?
How much blood is worth the draw?
Real love, real love
Real love makes your lungs black
Hummingbird watching
Watching her young thing
Grow up so fast
Looking up to her, watching her do her makeup and hair

Read over the love notes, the ones she wrote for me
And if she wants one night, that'll be just fine well
Somebody fetch my walking cain, I'm gonna get my baby
I'm gonna run to meet her neeth the shadow of the pines
She's gonna hop that coal train, she'll get off on Harlan road
Love me till the mornin' comes, leave me like a dream
I'd run to her through tobacco fields, and over across the clovers
I'd wade a mile through a brirepatch boy, just to touch her skin
I reckon im the foolish kind, to beckon to her callin
But I cant seem to help myself, Let that woman win
And if she wants one night, i'm gonna get whats mine well

Either lay here in this lonely room
Or let her have her way
Buddy all I need is one night where she don't leave
This one just might be the night, she decides to stay

cause I am a coward myself

No patience takes time
Excuses do only do good if you're waiting around
to die
And everyone is born with selfworth

It takes letting go of what we know we can't live
without
But the blood in the water
Is the blood of my brother
We both learned it didn't mean a thing in the end
if one was thicker than the other
And I've tried having faith

One's in love and sitting on gold, and one's already walked that road
One's on year number 33, and one just bought that diamond ring
  One says dad so how'd you do it?
The other just laughed and said there ain't nothing to it
You just try to quit smoking and reel back the drinkin'
Don't always tell her everything your thinkin'
And dance her when she needs dancing
You get up and go to work get up and go to church
Crawl up in that bed right next to her
And listen, instead of having all the answers
And then he slapped him on the back, and said son you can do it
   There ain't nothin' to it
Now there will be trouble on the way, words will fly and dishes break
But baby comes in and money goes out, you'll learn to ride the ups and downs
You'll wanna quit a million times, but if you hang on the years unwind
You could get to see your blushing bride
  Turn a beautiful 35, or 45, or 55
You'll be glad you quit smoking, reel back the drinkin'
Didn't always tell her everything you were thinkin'
And danced her, when she needed dancing
You got up and went to work, got up and went to church
Crawled up in that bed right next to her
And listen, instead of having all the answers

Mounting mileage on the dash
Double darkness falling fast
I keep stressing, pressing on
Way deep down at some substratum
 Feels like something really wrong has happened
 And I confess I'm barely hanging on
All my happiness is gone
All my happiness is gone
It's all gone somewhere beyond
All my happiness is gone
Ten thousand afternoons ago
  All my happiness just overflowed
That was life at first and goal to go
Me and you and us and them
And all those people way back when
All our hardships were just yardsticks then, you know, you know
Not the purple hills
It's not the silver lake
It's not the snowcloud shadowed interstates
It's not the icy bike chain rain of Portland, Oregon
Where nothing's wrong and no one's asking
But the fear's so strong it leaves you gasping
No way to last out here like this for long
'Cause everywhere I go, I know. Everywhere I go, I know

I see you standing there on that lawn,
Discount shades, store bought tan,
flip-flops and cut off jeans.
Somewhere between that setting sun,
I'm On Fire and Born To Run,
You looked at me and I was done,
but we were just getting started.
I was singing to you, you were singing to me,
I was so alive, never been more free,
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang oh-woah-oh-woah-ohh.
Stayed there till they forced us out,
and took the long way to your house,
And I can still hear the sound,
Of you saying don't go.
When I think about you,
I think about 17,
I think about my old Jeep,
I think about the stars in the sky.
Funny how a melody sounds like a memory,
Like a soundtrack to a July Saturday night,
Springsteen.
If I bumped into you by happenstance,
You probably wouldn't even know who I am,
But if I whispered your name,
I bet there'd still be a spark.
From back when I was gasoline and this old tattoo had brand new ink,
And we didn't care what your mom would think 'bout your name on my arm.
Baby is it spring or is it summer,
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer,
You hear sometimes late at night on your radio.
Even though you're a million miles away,
When you hear Born In The USA,
Do you relive those Glory Days from so long ago?
When you think about me,
Do you think about 17,
Do you think about my old Jeep,
Think about the stars in the sky.

48,My Church (verÂ 3),Maren Morris,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/maren-morris/my-church-chords-1838945,"Iâve cussed on a Sunday
 Iâve cheated and Iâve lied
Iâve fallen down from grace
 A few too many times
But I find holy redemption
 When I put this car in drive
 Roll the windows down and turn up the dial
Can I get a hallelujah
 Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
 When I play the highway FM
 I find my soul revival
 Singing every single verse
 Yeah I guess thatâs my church
When Hank bring the sermon
And Cash leads the choir
It gets my cold, cold heart burning
 Hotter than a ring of fire
When this wonderful world gets heavy
And I need to find my escape
I just keep the wheels rolling, radio scrolling
Until my sins wash away
Can I get a hallelujah
 Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
 When I play the highway FM
 I find my soul revival
 Singing every single verse
 Yeah I guess thatâs my church
Can I get a hallelujah
 Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
 When I play the highway FM
 I find my soul revival
 Singing every single verse
 Yeah I guess thatâs my church
 Yeah I guess thatâs my church
 Yeah I guess thatâs my church

49,If I Die Young (verÂ 3),The Band Perry,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-band-perry/if-i-die-young-chords-955605,"If I die young
Bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
  Oh oh, oh oh
Lord make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with You when she stands under my colors
Oh and life ain't always what you think it ought to be
No, ain't even grey, but she buries her baby
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
If I die young
Bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
And I'll be wearing white when I come into Your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the loving of a man
but it sure felt nice when he was holding my hand
There's a boy here in town says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best boys
And I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts
Oh no, I'll sell them for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singing
Funny when you're dead how people start listening
If I die young
Bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
 Oh oh, the ballad of a dove
  Go in peace and love
Gather up your tears
Keep them in your pocket
Save them for a time when you're really gonna need them.
Oh oh, the sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best boys
And I'll wear my pearls

a little wiser with a lot more wealth
and without you it's true I'd be free
to go chasin' all my dreams without any strings
But I wouldn't want it any other way ,
have in you to come home to at the end of every day,
your tender touch puts a smile back on my face,
wouldn't want it any other way,
Hard times, may never let up on us
and maybe all we'll ever have, will barely be enough
and girl you know how cold the wind can blow
love has never let us down when we needed it the most,
your tender touch puts a smile back on my face
wouldn't want it any other way__ ay!
wouldn't want it any other way.
any other way__ ay
you know I love you more each day ,
any other way__ay, .

In your silk upholstered chair
Talking with some rich folk that you know
Well, I hope you won't see me
In my ragged company
'Cause you know I couldn't ever stand to be alone
Take me down, little Susie, take me down
I know you think you're the queen of the underground
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flowers by the mail
Send me dead flowers to my wedding
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave
Well, when you're sitting back
In your rose pink Cadillac
Making bets on Kentucky Derby Day
I'll be in my basement room
With a needle and a spoon
And another girl to take my pain away
Take me down, little Susie, take me down
I know you think you're the queen of the underground
And you can send me dead flowers every morning
Send me dead flowers by the mail
Send me dead flowers at my wedding
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave
Take me down, little Susie, take me down
I know you think you're the queen of the underground

I got one more chance before she drives away

That'll make her change her mind

She was waving her arms around like she was fightin' bees

Made so much sense to me
That I still feel like I'm half asleep

She gave me diamonds for eyes
She walked by
Now I'm hypnotised
By this dream
That just won't stop
And I feel
Like I've always been lost in this dream
The rumours of heaven
Only speak the truth on earth
My dark angel
Shine your light on my curse
You are the other that I have to find
Until I do
I guess I'll see you 'round my mind

Is a place I have to go
I heard a rumour
She loves the mountains and the snow

She gave me diamonds for eyes
My dark angel
I offer you my heart
My dark angel
I think I loved you from the start

That I've never seen
Sometimes I feel I've been living
In someone elses dream
'Still I thank you
For stopping to talk
And I wonder
Just into who's dream did who walk

Shine your light on me
Shine your light, Shine your light
Shine your light on me, on me

He knew his place, it was right beside her
step by step, up to her world
and gettin' caught didn't seem to matter
'cause heaven was waitin' at the top of Jacob's ladder.
It'll be five years September
and a note on her window sill
but nothin' melts a heart like a grandchild will

He thinks back and his eyes shine
says listen child, once upon a time...

He knew his place, it was right beside her

Every thunder cloud that came was one more I might not get through
On the darkest day there's always light, and now I see it too
But I never liked the rain until I walked through it with you
I hear it fallin' in the night, and fillin' up my mind
All the heaven's rivers come to light, I see it all unwind
I hear it talkin' through the trees, and on the window pane
When I hear it I just can't believe, I never liked the rain
(Like the rain) I have fallen for you and I know just why, you
(Like the rain) Always calling for you, I'm fallin' for you now
Just like the rain
When the cloud is rollin' over, thunder's strikin' me
It's as bright as lightning and I wonder why I couldn't see
That it's always good and when the flood is gone we still remain
Guess I've known all along I just belong here with you, fallin'
(Like the rain) I have fallen for you and I know just why, you
(Like the rain) Always callin' for you, I'm fallin' for you now, just
(Like the rain) I have fallen for you, I'm fallin' for you now

And when the night falls on our better days, and we're lookin' to the sky
For the winds to take us high above the plains
I know that we'll find better ways, to look into the eye
Of the storms that will be callin', forever we'll be fallin'

When she hit the solid concrete ground
From thirty flights above and she was thirty something loving nothing
Gone out the window, she had
Gone out the window, she had
Gone out the window
Oh, catch me if I'm falling
Catch me if I'm   calling
He was smart, he was wise
He profoundly philosophized
Empathy for all humanity
One day by an open window there's a note that read
""I've gone out the window, I'm dead""
He said yes to life for all his life but then one day he said
  Out the window, here I
Go out the window, here I
Go out the window
Oh, catch me if I'm falling
Catch me if I'm   calling
Catch me I have fallen
Catch me I have   fallen
Catch me we are
Falling
Catch me we are
 Calling
Catch me we are
  Falling
Catch me we are
Calling

I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
I went right home and I went to bed
Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun 
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico
Laid in the hot joints takin' the pills
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willie Lee your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down
Said yes, oh yes my name is Willie Lee 
If you've got a warrant just read it to me
Shot her down because she made me slow
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more
When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on a train and they took me back
Had no friend for to go my bail 
They slapped my dottered carcass in that county jail
Early next mornin' bout a half past nine 
I spied the sheriff coming down the line
He kind of coughed as he cleared his throat
He said, ""Come on you dirty hack to the district court""
Into the courtroom my trial began 
Where I was held by twelve honest men
Just before the jury started out 
I saw that dirty judge commence to look about
In about five minutes in walked a man 
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree 
I hollered, ""Lawdy Lawdy, have mercy on me""
The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen 
99 years in the Folsom state pen
99 years underneath that ground 
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down
Come on you've gotta listen unto me 
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be

46,You Had Me From Hello (ver 2),Kenny Chesney,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/kenny-chesney/you-had-me-from-hello-chords-950212,"One word   that's all you said
And something in your voice caused me to turn my head
Your smile just captured me
And you were in my future far as I could see
And I don't know how it happened, but it happened still
You asked me if I love you, if I always will.  Well..
You  had me from hello; and I felt love start to grow
The moment that I looked into your eyes you won me
It  was over from the start, you com-pletely stole my heart
And now you won't let go;  I never even had a chance you know
You had me from hello
Inside I built a wall
So high around my heart I thought I'd never fall
One touch you brought it down
Bricks of my defenses scattered on the ground
And I swore to me I wasn't gonna love again
Last time was the last time I'd let someone in, but
Thats all you said
And something in your voice caused me to turn my head
You had me from hello
You had me from hello
Girl, I loved you from ... hello

47,The Thunder Rolls (ver 3),Garth Brooks,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/garth-brooks/the-thunder-rolls-chords-1763198,"Three thirty in the morning, not a soul in sight 
The city's lookin' like a ghost town, on a moonless summer night 
Raindrops on the windshield, there's a storm moving in 
He's headin' back from somewhere, that he never should have been 
    And the thunder rolls                    
    And the thunder rolls 
Every light is burnin' in a house across town 
She's pacin' by the telephone in her faded flannel gown 
Askin' for miracle hopin' she's not right 
Prayin' it's the weather that's kept him out all night 
    And the thunder rolls 
    And the thunder rolls 
The thunder rolls   and the lightnin' strikes 
Another love grows cold,  on a sleepless night 
As the storm blows on,    out of control 
Deep in her heart,           the thunder rolls 
She's waitin' by the window when he pulls into the drive 
She rushes out to hold him thankful he's alive 
But on the wind and rain a strange new perfume blows 
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes and he knows that she knows 
    And the thunder rolls 
    And the thunder rolls 
The thunder rolls   and the lightnin' strikes 
Another love grows cold,  on a sleepless night 
As the storm blows on,    out of control 
Deep in her heart,           the thunder rolls
She runs back down the hallway to the bedroom door 
She reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer 
Tells the lady in the mirror he won't do this again 
Cause tonight will be the last time she'll wonder where he's been
(let this chord ring for a full measure)
The thunder rolls   and the lightnin' strikes 
Another love grows cold,  on a sleepless night 
As the storm blows on,    out of control
Deep in her heart,           the thunder rolls

As I looked through the windshield at the quiet little  street
He was smiling so proud as he gave me the key
But inside I knew he was as nervous as  me
I said Daddy oh Daddy are you sure I know  how
Are you sure that I'm ready to drive this car  now
He  said I'm right here beside  you
And you're gonna do  fine
All you gotta do is keep it between the  lines 
'Cause it's a long narrow  road
Only the Good Lord knows where it leads in the  end
But you got to  begin
So keep your  hands on the wheel
Believe in  the things that are  real
Just take your time and keep it between  the lines
I was sitting in my chair and sneaking a look at  him
Lying on the floor with his colouring  book
Then he caught me watching and he climbed on my  knee
He said Daddy oh Daddy would you do one with  me
Then I hugged him so tightly as we turned the  page
Said I haven't done this since I was your  age
He  said I'm right here beside  you
And you're  gonna do fine
Daddy all you gotta do is keep it between the  lines
So we finished the picture and I put him to bed
Got down on my knees and I bowed my  head
I said Father oh Father I feel so  alone
Are you sure I can riase him with his Mommy  gone
Then the answer came back so gentle and low
And words of my Daddy from so long  ago
He said I'm right here beside you and you're gonna do  fine
All you gotta do is keep it between the  lines
So keep your  hands on the wheel
Believe in the things that are  real
Take your time and keep it between the  lines
Just take your time and keep it between the  lines

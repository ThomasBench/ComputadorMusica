0,Big Green Tractor (ver 3),Jason Aldean,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jason-aldean/big-green-tractor-chords-1408515,"She had a shiny little Beamer with the ragtop down
sitting in the drive but she wouldn't get out
The dogs were all barking and a wagging around
And I just laughed and said y'all get in
She had on a new dress and she curled her hair
She was looking too good not to go somewhere
Said what'cha wanna do, baby I don't care
We can go to the show, we can stay right here
and I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
we can go slow or make it go faster
down through the woods and out to the pasture
long as I'm with you it really don't matter
climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
girl you know you got me to hold on to
we can go to town or baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor
we can fire it up and I can show you around
sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
when the fireflies are dancing and the moon comes out
we can turn on the lights and head back to the house
or we can take another ride on my big green tractor
we can go slow or make it go faster
down through the woods and out to the pasture
long as I'm with you it really don't matter
climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
girl you know you got me to hold on to
we can go to town baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor
Hmmm, just let me dust off the seat
Hmmm, put your pretty little arms around me
You can climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
girl you know you got me to hold on to
we can go to town or baby if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor
        We can go to town     or we can go another round
        On my big green tractor

1,Do I (ver 3),Luke Bryan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/luke-bryan/do-i-chords-929188,"   Baby what are we becomin'?
   It feels just like we're always runnin'
   Rollin' through the motions everyday
   I can lean in to hold you
   Or act like I don't even know you
   Seems like you could care less either way
   What happened to that girl I used to know?
   I just want us back to the way we were before
Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love, am I'm still enough?
Tell me don't I or tell me do I, baby
Give you everything that you ever wanted
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Baby, do I
   Remember when we didn't have nothin'
   But a perfect simple kind of lovin'
   Baby, those sure were the days
   There was a time our love ran wild and free
   But, now I'm second guessin' everything thing I see
Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love, am I'm still enough?
Tell me don't I or tell me do I, baby
Give you everything that you ever wanted
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Baby, do I
Still give you what you need,
Still take your breath away
Light up the spark way down deep, baby do I 
            woah
Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy
Do I have your love, am I'm still enough
Tell me don't I or tell me do I baby
Give you everything that you ever wanted
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely
do I just need to give up and get on with my life
Tell me baby do I get one more try?
Do I,     baby do I

Me and Mary makin' our way into the night,
You can hear the cries from the carnival rides
The pinball bells and the ski ball slides,
Watchin' the summer sun fall out of sight
There's a warm wind comin' in,     from off of the ocean
Makin' it's way past the hotel walls to fill the street,
Mary is holdin' both of her shoes in her hand
Said she likes to feel the sand beneath her feet
And in the mornin' I'm leavin' makin my way back to Cleveland,
So tonight I hope, that I will do just   fine,
And I don't see, how you could ever be,
 anything but mine
There's a local band playin' at the seaside pavillion
And I got just enough cash to get us in
And as we are dancin' Mary's wrappin' her arms around me
And I can feel the sting of summer on my skin
In the midst of the music,   I tell her I love her
We both laugh, 'cause we know it isn't true
Oh, but Mary there's a summer drawin' to an end tonight
And there's so much that I long to do to you
And in the mornin' I'm leavin' makin my way back to Cleveland,
So tonight I hope, that I will do just   fine,
And I don't see, how you could ever be,

5,Furr (ver 4),Blitzen Trapper,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/blitzen-trapper/furr-chords-794811,"Yeah, when I was only se-   ven- teen 
I could hear the angels whis- per- ing
So I drove into the woods and wandered aimlessly about
Until I heard my mother shouting through the fog
It turned out to be the howling of a dog
Or a wolf to be exact, the sound sent shivers down my back
But I was drawn into the pack and before long
They allowed me to join in and sing their song
So from the cliffs and highest hill, yeah we would gladly get our fill
Howling endlessly and shrilly at the dawn 
And I lost the taste for judging right from wrong 
For my flesh had turned to fur, yeah and my thoughts, they surely were
turned to instinct and obedience to God
You can wear your fur like the river on fire
But you better be sure if your makin' God a liar
I'm a rattlesnake, babe, I'm like fu-el on fire
So if you're gonna' get made
Don't be afraid of what you've learned      
On the day that I turned twen- ty-  three 
I was curled up underneath a dogwood tree 
When suddenly a girl, with skin the color of a pearl 
Wandered aimlessly, but she didn't seem to see
She was listenin' for the angels just like me
So I stood and looked about, I brushed the leaves off of my snout
And then I heard my mother shouting through the trees 
You should have seen that girl go shaky at the knees 
So I took her by the arm, we settled down upon a farm 
And raised our children up as gently as you pleased
And now my fur has turned to skin and I've been quickly ushered in 
To a world that I confess I do not know
But I still dream of running careless through the snow
An' through the howlin' winds that blow, across the ancient distant flow
It fill our bodies up like water till we know
You can wear your fur like the river on fire
But you better be sure if your makin' God a liar
I'm a rattlesnake, babe, I'm like fu-el on fire
So if you're gonna' get made
Don't be afraid of what you've learned

I will resurrect it, I'll have a good go at it
I'll streak his blood across my beak
Dust my feathers with his ash
I can feel his ghost breathing down my back
I will try and know whatever I try
I will be gone but not forever
I will try and know whatever I try
I will be gone but not forever
Real truth about it is
No one gets it right
Real truth about it is
We're all supposed to try
There ain't no end to the sands
I've been trying to cross
The real truth about it is
My kind of life's no better off
It's got the maps or if it's lost
We will try and know whatever We'll try
We will be gone but not forever
C'mon lets try and know whatever we'll try
We will be gone but not forever
Real truth about it is
There ain't no end to the desert I'll cross
I've really known it all along
Mama here comes midnight
With the dead moon in its jaws
Must be the big star about to fall

With the dead moon in its jaws

You were the first, So was I; We made love and then you cried:
Remember when. 
Remember when, We vowed the vows and walked the walk.
We gave our hearts, made the start, an' it was hard.
We lived and learned, Life threw curves, There was joy an' there was hurt:
Remember when.
Remember when.   Old ones died and new were born.
And life was changed,    Disassembled, rearranged.
We came together, Fell apart, And broke each other's hearts:
Remember when.
Remember when, The sound of little feet...
Was the music, We danced to, Week to week.
Brought back the love, We found trust, Vowed we'd never give it up:
Remember when.
Remember when,     Thirty seemed so old.
Now, lookin' back, It's just a steppin' stone.
To where we are, Where we've been; Said we'd do it all again:
Remember when.
Remember when, We said when we turned gray,
When the children, Grow up and move away
We won't be sad, We'll be glad, For all the life we've had:
And we'll remember when.
Remember when.

Life was just a nine to five.
With bills and pressure piled up to the sky.
She never asked, she knew I'd been,
hangin' with my wilder friends.
looking for another way to fly.
And three days straight was no big feat
I'd get by on no food or sleep
And crazy, was becoming my new norm.
I'd pass out on the bedroom floor.
And sleep right through the calm before the storm.
My life was just an old routine.
Everyday the same damn thing, I couldn't even tell I was alive.
I tell you. The high cost of living, 
ain't nothin' like the cost of living high.
That southern baptist parking lot.
Was where I'd go and smoke my pot.
Sit there in my pick-up truck and pray.
And stareing at that giant cross.
Just reminded me that I was lost.
And it just never seemed to point the way.
As soon as Jesus turned his back.
I'd find my way across the tracks.
Lookin' just to score another deal.
With my back against that damn eight ball.
I didn't have to think or talk or feel.
My life was just an old routine.
Everyday the same damn thing, I couldn't even tell I was alive.
I tell you. The high cost of living, 
ain't nothin' like the cost of living high.
My whole life went through my head.
Laying in that hotel bed.
Watchin' as the cops kicked in the door.
I had a job and a piece of land.
And my sweet wife, was my best friend.
But I traded that for cocaine and a whore.
With my new found sobriety.
I've got the time to sit and think.
Of all the things I had, and threw away.
This prison is much colder than that,
one that I was locked up in just yesterday.
My life was just an old routine.
Everyday the same damn thing, I couldn't even tell I was alive.
I tell you. The high cost of living, 
ain't nothin' like the cost of living high.

Momma used to send me over with things  
We struck a friendship up.  
I spent a few long summers,   out on his old porch swing.  
Says he was in the war went in the Navy.  
Lost his wife lost his baby.  
Broke down and asked him one time  
How ya keep from going cra-zy

said I raise my hands.

Talkin' to mom on the phone one night 
Getting all caught up on the gossip 
The ins and outs of the small town life

I laid there thinkin' back 
Thought 'bout couple long-lost summers 
    I didn't know whether to cry or laugh

Deserved a ticket to the other side 
I'd be that sweet old man 
Who looked me in the eye 
said I raise my hands.

The longer that I live

No this can't be all there is.

Spend your life working it out

Said it's your daddy, you need to come home
This is it, I think he's dying
She laid the phone down by his head
The last words that he said
Cowgirls don't cry
Ride, baby, ride
Lessons in life show us all in time
Too soon God lets you know why
If you fall get right back on
Good Lord calls everybody home
Cowgirls don't cry

What's so amazing that keeps us star-gazing?
And what do we think we might see?

saying somebody got shot, somebody's been abused
somebody blew up a building somebody stole a car
somebody got away somebody didn't get too far
yea, they didn't get too far
grandpappy told my pappy back in my day son
that a man had to answer for the wicked he done
take all the rope in texas, find a tall oak tree
round up all of them bad boys, hang them high in the streets
for all the people to see
cause justice is the one thing you should always find
you gotta saddle up your boys you gotta draw a hard line
when the gun smoke settles we'll sing a victory tune
and we'll all meet back at the local salloon
and we'll raise up our glasses against evil forces sayin
whiskey for my men, beer for my horses
(whiskey for my men, beer for my horses) this is played in the 2nd and 3rd chorus' only.
we got too many gansters doing dirty deeds
too much corruption and crime on the streets
it's time the long arm of the law put a few more in the ground
send them all to their maker and he'll settle them down
you can bet he'll set em down
cause justice is the one thing you should always find
you gotta saddle up your boys you gotta draw a hard line

Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you
Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you
I think about the years I spent just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there you understand
It's all part of a grander plan 
that is coming true
Now I'm just rolling home
Into my lover's arms
This much I know is true
That God blessed the broken road
That led me straight to you

That led me straight to you.

""Hey buddy, how 'bout a helping hand.""
I said, ""Dave,""

But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really hold my own
But if you wanna fight tonight
Guess those boys don't look all that tough

But I'm as good once as I ever was

Now my body says, ""You can't do this, boy.""
But my pride says, ""Oh, yes you can.”
I ain't as good as I once was
That’s just the cold, hard truth
I still throw a few back, talk a little smack

My eyes been stung with dust and blind
Lost you just the same

And a small town Southern man
Like his daddy's daddy before him
Brought up workin' on the land
Fell in love with a small town woman
And they married up and settled down
Natural way of life if you're lucky
For a small town Southern man
First there came four pretty daughters
For this small town Southern man
Then a few years later came another
A boy, he wasn't planned
Seven people livin' all together
In a house built with his own hands
Little words with love and understandin'
From a small town Southern man
And he bowed his head to Jesus
And he stood for Uncle Sam
And he only loved one woman
He) was always proud of what he had
He said his greatest contribution
Is the ones you leave behind
Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
Of a small town Southern man
Callous hands told the story
For this small town Southern man
He gave it all to keep it all together
And keep his family on his land
Like his daddy, years wore out his body
Made it hard just to walk and stand
You can break the back
But you can't break the spirit
Of a small town Southern man
And he bowed his head to Jesus
And he stood for Uncle Sam
And he only loved one woman
He) was always proud of what he had
He said his greatest contribution
Is the ones you leave behind
Raised on the ways and gentle kindness
Of a small town Southern man
Finally death came callin'
For this small town Southern man
He said it's alright 'cause I see angels
And they got me by the hand
Don't you cry, and don't you worry
I'm blessed, and I know I am
'Cause God has a place in Heaven

And he bowed his head to Jesus
And he stood for Uncle Sam
And he only loved one woman

I wished I was stronger
I wished I loved Jesus
The way my wife does
I wished any of it were easier
Instead of any longer
I wish I could have stood
Where you would have been proud
That won't happen now, that won't happen now
There's a whole lot of singing that's never gonna be heard
Disappearing every day without so much as a word
Somehow
Think I broke the wings off that little song bird
She's never gonna fly to the top of the world right now
Top of the world
I don't have to answer
Any of these questions
Don't have no god to teach me no lessons
I come home in the evening
Sit in my chair
One night they called me for supper
But I never got up
I stayed right there
In my chair
I wished I would have known you
Wished I would have shown you
All of the things
I was on the inside
I pretend to be sleeping
When you come in in the morning
To whisper goodbye
Go to work in the rain
I don't know why
Don't know why
Cause everybody's singing
We just want to be heard
Disappearing everyday
Without so much as a word
Wanna grab a hold of that little song bird
Take her for a ride to the top of the world

Oh,  oh...  
To the top of the world
To the top of the world
To the top of the world

My brother said that I, was rotten to the core.
I was the youngest child,  so I got by with more.
I guess she was tired by, the time I came along.
She'd laugh until she cried, I could do no wrong.
She would always save me, because I was her baby.
I worked a factory in Ohio, a shrimp boat in the Bayou,
I drove a truck in Birmingham.
Turned 21 in Cincinnati,I called home to mom and daddy,
I said ""Your boy is now a man.""
She said ""I don't care if you're 80, you'll always be my baby.""
She loved that photograph, of our whole family.
She'd always point us out, for all her friends to see.
That's Greg he's doing great, he really loves his job.
And Ronnie with his 2 kids, how 'bout that wife he's got.
And that one's kinda crazy, but that one is my baby.
I got a call in Alabama, said come on home to Louisianna 
and come as fast as you can fly.
Cause your momma really needs you, and says she's got to see you, 
she might not make it through the night.
The whole way I drove 80, so she could see her baby.
She looked like she was sleepin' and my family had been weepin' 
by the time that I got to her side.
And I knew that she'd been taken, and my heart it was breakin', 
I never got to say goodbye.
I softly kissed that lady, and cried just like a baby.

Why put a new address
On the the same old loneliness
Everybody knows where that is
We built that house of his
And when he’s not home
someone else we know always is
If Heaven’s really coming back
I hope it has a heart attack
When they see how dangerous
It is for guys like that
And the night has always known
When its time to get going
When its really been so long
that it starts showing
It’s always had that ghost
It always almost tells me
the secret
how there’s really no difference
in who he was once and who
he’s become
I think he’s been lettin' me win
And I think he’s doing it again
Thanks for letting me win
And everything you hated me for
Honey, there was so much more
I just didn’t get busted
I ain’t looking for that easy way out
This whole life its been about
Trying trying trying
Trying trying try
To be simple again.
Just be simple again.

0,Til A Tear Becomes A Rose,Keith Whitley,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/keith-whitley/til-a-tear-becomes-a-rose-chords-1471934,"Darling I can see the clouds around you
And in your heart I know a sorrow grows
But if you weep I'll be right here to hold you
Til each tear you cry becomes a rose
Dearest love I know your heart is shattered       
And all my words can offer no relief
But my love will heal the pain you've suffered
And I'll be here if you should turn to me
Darling I can see the clouds around you
And in your heart I know a sorrow grows
But if you weep I'll be right here to hold you
Til each tear you cry becomes a rose
In deepest nights when memories tend to gather
Lay with me and put your fears to sleep
Cause there's no pain no dream can put us under
All the love that binds you and me
Darling I can see the clouds around you
And in your heart I know a sorrow grows
But if you weep I'll be right here to hold you
Til each tear you cry becomes a rose
Til each tear you cry becomes a rose

A seaman friend of mine (I'll not say which seaman)
Walked up to a big old building (I won't say which building)
And would not have walked up the stairs (not to say which stairs)
If there had not have been two girls
My seaman buddy and his girl moved off
After a couple of pages, and there I was
And as well as I could recall
The girl had told us that she was a niece of Walt Whitman
And it takes a night and a girl
A long long time to find its way back

It must have been a combination of shooters and neon lights

Yeah I might have said the words but they came from somewhere else
It was just the tequila talking when I told you I'm still not over you
I get a little sentimental and I had one or two
And that tear in my eye was the salt and the lime, not the memory of you walking
And if I said I'm still in love with you it was just the tequila talking.
I don't know what they put in Cuervo that makes me say such things
Usually I wouldn't care so much or make such a scene
But seeing you there in that dress you're wearing just drove me right out of my head
So don't hold me responsible for anything I might have said

Who seem to get by on their own
Those who will never take the fall

Walking a wire
Convinced it's not living

Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried it is merely survived

Deep in my soul
Constantly yearning to get out of control
Wanting to fly
Higher and higher
I can't abide, standing outside...the fire

Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried it is merely survived

And your mind somehow paid the price
You'll pay it again--somewhere--on down the line
When you're there I'm sure you'll stare
And I'll be behind you
Because your day is a clock of grey hours
And your smile has lost all it's power
But sometimes, Jezebelle, it shines like the sun
When you're gone and when you're done
I will be behind you
Because your songs are so sad and tired
Because hunger is a darkness inside the phone wire
It always has been, it always will be So it seems to me
But that's the price you pay when you say
I will be behind you
Because your Ford broke down on 47
Because eight cylinders is your idea of heaven
You'll get it running--someday--and you'll ride right down the line
When you do, I hope it's true
And I'll ride beside you
When you do, I hope it's true

Like it was the holy grail
Descend beautiful spirit
Into the evening pale

Kickin' in the corral smelling rain
There's a low thunder rolling
'Cross the mesquite plain

Where she danced to make ends meet
I'd spend the night over my gin
As she'd talk to her men
Well the piss yellow sun
Comes bringing up the day
She said ain't nobody gonna give nobody
What they really need anyway
You get so sick of the fighting
You lose your fear of the end
But you can't lose your memory
And the sweet smell of your skin
And it's dry lightning

Where the wolf, bear and owl give a terrifying howl
And disturb our nightly dreams

While the cold winter winds do blow

To the wild woods we must go
Had we ale, wine or beer our spirits for to cheer
When we're in those woods so wild
Where a glass of whiskey shone, while we're in the woods alone

Goodbye  so long  I guess that's just the way I'll always be
So when I get that feelin' don't try to hold me back

But he don't understand me when I'm feelin  blue

Goodbye, so long, It's coming down  just hear that whistle blow
It'll be here in a minute, you'll wave and I'll look back

45,Blue Clear Sky,George Strait,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/george-strait/blue-clear-sky-chords-85409,"You swear you've had enough
You're ready to give up
On that little lie they call love
Then out of the blue clear sky
Fallin' right into your hands
Like rain on the desert sand
It's the last thing you had planned
Then out of the blue clear sky
  Here she comes, a walkin' talkin' true love
  Sayin' I've been lookin' for you love
  Surprise, your new love has arrived
Out of the blue clear sky
Ain't love a funny thing
One day you're givin' up the dream
And the next you're pickin' out a ring
Out of the blue clear sky
  Here she comes, a walkin' talkin' true love
  Sayin' I've been lookin' for you love
  Surprise, your new love has arrived
Out of the blue clear sky
  Here she comes, a walkin' talkin' true love
  Sayin' I've been lookin' for you love
  Surprise, your new love has arrived
Out of the blue clear
 Here she comes, a walkin' talkin' true love
  Sayin' I've been lookin' for you love
  Surprise, your new love has arrived

46,I Can Still Make Cheyenne (ver 5),George Strait,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/george-strait/i-can-still-make-cheyenne-chords-1859968," Her telephone rang 'bout a quarter to nine, she heard his voice on the other end of the line
 She wondered what was wrong this time, she never knew what his calls might bring
 With a cowboy like him it could be anything, and she always expected the worst in the back of her mind.
 He said, ""It's cold out here and I'm all alone, didn't make the short go again and I'm coming home.
 I know I've been away too long, I never got a chance to write or call
 And I know this rodeo has been hard on us all, but I'll be home soon and honey is there something wrong?""
 She said, ""Don't bother comin' home. by the time you get here I'll be long gone.
 There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man.""
 He said, ""I'm sorry it's come down to this, there's so much about you that I'm gonna miss.
 But it's alright baby, if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne.
 Gotta go now baby, if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne.
 He left that phone danglin' off the hook, then slowly turned around and gave it one last look
 Then he just walked away. He aimed his truck toward that Wyoming line.
 With a little luck he could still get there in time
 And in that Cheyenne wind he could still hear her say.

47,Windfall (ver 3),Son Volt,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/son-volt/windfall-chords-438677," Now and then it keeps you running
 Never seems to die
 Trail spent with fear
Not enough living on the outside
 Never seem to get far enough
 Staying in be-tween the lines
Hold on to what you can
Waiting for the end, not knowing when
May the wind take your troubles away
May the wind take your troubles away
Both feet on the floor
Two hands on the wheel
May the wind take your troubles away
 Trying to make it far enough
 To the next time zone
Few and far between past the midnight hour
  Never feel alone
You're really not alone
  Switching it over to A.M.
  Searching for a truer sound
Can't re-call the call letters
Steel gui-tar, I settle down
  Catching an all-night station
  Somewhere in Lou-isiana
  Sounds like 1963
  But for  now sounds like heaven
May the wind take your troubles away
May the wind take your troubles away
Both feet on the floor
Two hands on the wheel
May the wind take your troubles away
May the wind take your troubles a-way
May the wind
Take your troubles away

Any man of mine better walk the line,
Better show me a teasin' squeezin' pleasin' kinda time.

He's gotta be a heartbeatin' fine treatin'

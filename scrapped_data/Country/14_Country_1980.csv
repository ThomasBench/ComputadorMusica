0,Forever And Ever Amen (ver 2),Randy Travis,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/randy-travis/forever-and-ever-amen-chords-3153848,"You may think that I'm talking foolish
You've heard that I'm wild and I'm free
You may wonder how I can promise you now
This love, that I feel for you, always will be
You're not just time that I'm killing
I'm no longer one of those guys
As sure as I live this love that I give
Is gonna be yours until the day that I die – oh, baby
I'm gonna love you forever, forever and
ever, Amen​
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
I'll be happy to tell you again
I'm gonna love you forever and ever,
forever and ever, Amen
They say that time takes its toll on a body
Makes the young girls brown hair turn grey
But honey, I don't care, I ain't in love with your hair
And if it all fell out, well, I'd love you
They say that time can play tricks on a
memory
Make people forget things they knew
Well, it's easy to see it's happening to me
I've already forgotten every woman but you –
oh, darling
I'm gonna love you forever, forever and
ever, Amen​
As long as old men sit and talk about the weather
As long as old women sit and talk about old men
If you wonder how long I'll be faithful
Just listen to how this song ends
I'm gonna love you forever and ever,
forever and ever, Amen
I'm gonna love you forever and ever,
forever and ever, forever and ever, forever
and ever, Amen

Chill is in the air
All the gifts are waiting

Snow begin to fall

I hear a church bell ring

So I say a silent prayer
For creatures great and small

10,Wild Montana Skies,John Denver,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-denver/wild-montana-skies-chords-2303711,"He was born in the Bitteroot Valley in the early morning rain
Wild geese over the water, heading north and home again
Bringin' a warm wind from the south, bringin' the first taste of the spring
His mother took him to her breast and softly she did sing:
Oh, Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
His mother died that summer and he never learned to cry
He never knew his father and he never did ask why
He never knew the answers that would make an easy way
But he learned to know the wilderness and to be a man that way
His mother's brother took him in to his family and his home
Gave him a hand that he could lean on and a strength to call his own
And he learned to be a farmer and he learned to love the land
And he learned to read the seasons and he learned to make a stand
Oh, Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
On the eve of his 21st birthday, he set out on his own
He was 30 years and runnin' when he found his way back home
Ridin' a storm across the mountains and an achin' in his heart
Said he came to turn the pages and to make a brand new start
Now he never told the story of the time that he was gone
Some say he was a lawyer, some say he was a john
There was something in the city that he said he couldn't breathe
There was something in the country that he said he couldn't leave
Oh, Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
Now some say he was crazy and some are glad he's gone
But some of us will miss him and we'll try to carry on
Giving a voice to the forest, giving a voice to the dawn
Giving a voice to the wilderness and the land that he lived on
Oh, Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies

the way it all would go.
Our lives, are better left to chance. I could have missed the pain
but I'd have had to miss the dance
Holding you I held everything.  For a moment wasn't I the king?
But if I'd only known how the king would fall, hey who's to say
you know I might have changed it all.
And now, I'm glad I didn't know the way it all would end,
the way it all would go.
Our lives, are better left to chance. I could have missed the pain
but I'd have had to miss the dance
Yes my life, it's better left to chance.
I could have have missed the pain,
but I'd have had to miss the dance.

19,Go Down Easy (ver 3),Dan Fogelberg,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/dan-fogelberg/go-down-easy-chords-1513497,"Linda lost her lover in the early part of autumn 
And she moved out to the country hoping all would be forgotten 
The last time that I saw her she was making sure the winter 
Wouldn't come through that old door frame 
Where the door is several inches from the ground, the cold hard ground 
And it's hard to go down easy 
And it's hard to keep from crying
And it's hard to lose a lover
In the early part of au-au-au-au-tumn 
Well, she learned to cook the meals and she learned to start the fire 
And she learned to make jewellery out of stones and precious metals 
She sits down to the table with her friends and several others 
And she tries real hard to never be alone 
And it's hard to go down easy 
And it's hard to keep from crying
And it's hard to lose a lover
In the early part of au-au-au-au-tumn 
Now the winter wind blows cold upon a fair and gentle soul 
And she feels as if her time is a-passing easy 
Her friends are sometimes lovers, though there'll always be another 
She thinks about when night time lays on down 
And it's hard to go down easy 
And it's hard to keep from crying
And it's hard to lose a lover
In the early part of au-au-au-au-tumn 
And it's hard to go down easy 
And it's hard to keep from crying

In a valley where no one goes
Where the wild water's rush
Rumbles deep in the hush

To where the white water winds
In the shadow of the pines

To the pot-belly stove
Where the firewood's all stacked
Ah, ma belle, my fleur-de-lis

In the shadow of the pines
Where that Lost River flows
It's someplace he's lost
Behind bridges that he's crossed

And he's much too far down
To return to higher ground

For me to build me a new bridge
When her love was still mine
And the world was still wild
Like the heart of a child

And figured we wanted to go somewhere
So we loaded up in my ragtop Chevrolet
We had a little bit of money
And a whole lot of show
And with Hank Jr. blaring on the radio
We got us a tank full of gas
And we was on our way
We figured we'd go down to New Orleans
We were barrelling down old 17
When a man with a blinking red light
Was on our tail
He said you were doing 60 in a 45
But I'm gonna let you go this time
But if I catch you again
I'm gonna slap you in the county jail
We said thank you sir you sure been nice
And you ain't gonna have to tell us twice
And we were Southbound and down with the wind
Blowing in our faces
We kept on rolling and pretty soon
The radio was cooking out a Haggard tune
And we were pulling into Houston
Checking out all them places
I was feeling dry and I said I think
We ought to stop and get ourselves a drink
And old Jim said yeah 'cause we got time to kill
We kept on rolling and I seen this spot
And we pulled into the parking lot
Of this place called the Cloud Nine Bar and Grill
We walked through the door
The lights were low they had a punk rock band
And some orange haired feller singing about suicide
I said Jim this ain't our kind of place
He said well let's just have one round anyway
So against my better judgement we walked on inside
Went up to the bar and we sat down
This feller walked up and said I'll buy this round
And he sat down on the barstool next to Jim
He looked like a girl but he talked like a guy
He had lipstick on and mascara in his eyes
And everybody in that place looked just about like him
I said Jim this ain't our kind of bar
Let's just go on out and get back in the car
'Cause there's gonna be trouble
Ain't no sense in taking a chance
We was getting up getting ready to leave
When somebody grabbed old Jim by the sleeve
And this good looking girl was asking my buddy to dance
I said Jim don't do it there's something missing
There's fellers dancing and fellers kissing
There's a feller in high heeled shoes wearing panty hose
He said partner I just can't turn this down
You just go over there and have one more round
And I'll dance with the lady
And we'll get on down the road
So he walked away and left me alone
But this funny looking feller kept coming on
And he was making me mad with some of the things he said
Then he put his hand on my knee
I said if you don't get your paw off me
I'm gonna locate your nose around
The other side of your head
He said I love it when you get that fire in your eye
I said well partner try this on for size
And I unloaded on him and he went out like a light
Everybody in that place must have been his friend
They all headed for me I said this is the end
But where I come from we don't give up
Without a fight
They were screaming and yelling and scratching and clawing
I was punching and hitting and kicking and pawing
I was holding my own 'cause I've been in a scrap or two
Old Jim come running up out of the blue
And that gal he was with come running up too
And proceeded to beat on me with a high heel shoe
I grabbed her by the hair it came off in my hand
And that beautiful girl was just a beautiful man
And old Jim just got sick right there on the floor
He dropped that dude like a shot from a gun
Smeared his lipstick made his makeup run
And me and old Jim started fighting our way to the door
We lit out of there in that Chevrolet
I put in on the floor and it stayed that way
We were going down the highway
Doing about a hundred and ten
We were headed for home and we was getting nearer
Then a red light came on the rear view mirror
And that same blame cop was pulling us over again
Now I'm sitting here in this county jail
I had to call my daddy to go our bail
But I learned me a lesson
That I never will forget again
I've done give up drinking I've give up bars
And running around the country in souped up cars
To be back where the women are women
And the men are men

Here I am closing my eyes again
Trying so hard not to see
All the things that I see
Almost willing to lie again
I swear that it just isn't so
It just isn't me
We are never alone
Even though we'd like to be.
Then I go and open my eyes again
Love in your eyes is the thing
That I'd most like to see.
I'd be willing to die again
To know of a place and a time
Where it always could be
To be always with you
And you always with me
This is my autograph
Here in the songs I sing
Here in my cry and my laugh
Here in the love that I bring
To be always with you
And you always with me.
Say a prayer and open your heart
again
You are the love and the life
That we all need to see.
Always willing to shine and then
Peace on this earth is the way
That it always can be
To be always with you
And you always with me.
This is my autograph
Here in the songs I sing
Here in my cry and my laugh
Here in the love that I bring
To be always with you
And you always with me.

I’d watch the trains as they roll by
And the whistle’s lonesome sound you could hear for miles around,
As they rolled across that Greenville Trestle high.
But the whistles don’t sound like they used to. Lately not many trains go by.
Hard times across the land mean no work for a railroad man.
And the Greenville Trestle now don’t seem so high.
On the riverbank I’d stand with a canepole in my hand
and watch the freight trains up against the sky.
With the  black smoke trailin’ back as they moved along the tracks,
that runs across that Greenville Trestle high
But the whistles don’t sound like they used to. Lately not many trains go by.
Hard times across the land mean no work for a railroad man.
And the Greenville Trestle now don’t seem so high.
When the lonesome whistles whine I get rambling on my mind
and I wish they still sounded that way.
As I turn and head for home, Lord she’d rumble, low, and moan
 toward the sunset at the close of day.
But the whistles don’t sound like they used to. Lately not many trains go by.
Hard times across the land mean no work for a railroad man.
And the Greenville Trestle now don’t seem so high.

I sat down in the front seat. He turned on the radio,

Have you paid your dues? Can you moan the Blues?
Can you bend them guitar strings?""
He said, ""Boy, can you make folks feel what you feel inside?
'Cause if you're big-star bound, let me warn you it's a long, hard ride.""

He said, ""This is where you get off, Boy, 'Cause I'm goin' back to Alabam'.""

With the devil snappin' at my heels
I broke through the trees, and there in the night
My father's house stood shining hard and bright
The branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms
But I ran till I fell, shaking in his arms
I awoke and I imagined the hard things that pulled us apart
Will never again, sir, tear us from each other's hearts
I got dressed, and to that house I did ride from out on the road,
I could see his windows shining in light
I walked up the steps and stood on the porch

Came and spoke to me through a chained door
I told her my story, and who I'd come for
She said ""I'm sorry but but no one by that name lives here anymore

Now he walks down the street in the evening
and he stops by the old candy store
And I somehow believe he's believeing
that he's holding her hand like before
For he feels all her love walking with him
And he smiles at the things she might say
And the old man walks up to the hill top
and he gives her a daisy a day
I'll give you a daisy a day dear
I'll give you a daisy a day
I'll love you until the rivers run still
and the four winds we know blow away
I'll give you a daisy a day dear
I'll give you a daisy a day
I'll love you until the rivers run still
and the four winds we know blow away

48,Do I Ever Cross Your Mind (ver 2),Dolly Parton,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/dolly-parton/do-i-ever-cross-your-mind-chords-2351635,"Oh, Oh, Oh,   Oh,Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh,   Oh,Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh,   Oh
Oh, Oh
Oh, sometimes I go walking through fields where we walked
Long ago in the sweet used to be,
And the flowers still grow, but they don't smell as sweet
As they did when you picked them for me.
And when I think of you and the love we once knew,
How I wish we could go back in time.
Do you ever think back on old memories like that,
Or do I ever cross your mind?
Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night because you
miss me, do you darling?
Oh, and do your memories ever take you back into another place and time?
And do you ever miss the feelings and the love we shared when you were
with me, tell me darling,
Or do I ever cross your mind?
Oh, how often I wish that again I could kiss
Your sweet lips like I did long ago,
And how often I long for those two loving arms
That once held me so gentle and close.
And when I think of you and the love we once knew,
How I wish we could go back in time.
Do you ever recall those old memories at all
Or do I ever cross your mind?
Do I ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night because you miss me
Oh, and do you memories ever take you back to another place in time?
And do you ever miss the feelings and love we shared when you were with me?
I just wonder do I cross your min
Oh, do I ever cross your mind
Oh, Oh, Oh,   Oh Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh,   Oh,Oh
Oh, Oh, Oh    Oh, Oh
Tell me, do I ever
Oh, do I ever, tell me
Do I ever cross your mind

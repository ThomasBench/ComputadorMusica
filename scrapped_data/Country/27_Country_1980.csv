I worked for all my life.
And I had to start again
Just my children and my wife.
I thank my lucky stars,
To be living here today.
'Cause the flag still stands for freedom
And they can't take that away
I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free.
And I won't forget the men who died
And gave that right to me.
And I'll gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today.
Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land.
God Bless The USA!
From the lakes of Minnesota,
To the hills of Tennessee.
Across the plains of Texas,
From sea to shining sea.
From Detroit down to Houston,
And New York to L.A.
There's pride in every American heart
And it's time we stand and say
That proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free.
And I won't forget the men who died
And gave that right to me.
And I'll gladly stand up next to you
And defend her still today.

10,Old Coyote Town,Don Williams,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/don-williams/old-coyote-town-chords-2668557,"He’s got a US flag on his front porch
To remind everyone where he lives
And up in the attic there are papers that prove
The old house is finally his
After thirty-five years the grass still don’t grow
In that rock hard west Texas ground
Where my old dad still clings to that old coyote
town
Like horses the pick-ups are parked out in front
Of a cafe that don’t need a name
Where the old men rock and the tumbleweeds roll
Past the boarded up windows down Main
Waist high weeds hide a for sale sign
At the drive-in where my innocence died
With a rusty advertisement, dangling by a nail
Says Popcorn and Pepsi for a dime
And down at the depot where I left for good
There’s a hobo with his three-legged hound
Waitin' for a train, that no longer comes to that
old coyote town
And the interstate rumbles like a river that runs
To a rhythm that don’t ever slow down
As cars and trucks, and time pass by
That old coyote town
Daddy falls asleep in the living room
On the sofa with the TV on
Sometimes he waits for a phone call from me
Sometimes he waits too long
But I still think of the people and the place that
How much longer will they be around
Till its ashes to ashes, dust to dust
For that old coyote town
Like horses the pick-ups are parked out in front
Of a cafe that don't need a name
Where the old men rock and the tumbleweeds roll
Past the boarded up windows down Main
And the interstate rumbles like a river that runs
To a rhythm that don’t ever slow down
As cars and trucks, and time pass by
That old coyote town
God bless that old coyote town

11,Heartbeat In The Darkness,Don Williams,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/don-williams/heartbeat-in-the-darkness-chords-3801995,"Cadillac smiles in the ladies' styles
In this world, they ain't no part of me
A hundred dollar bill can cure your ills
in this world but it ain't no good to me
You see money and clothes are easily burned
People and cars are easily turned around
I'm looking for something that'll last me all of my life
I'm listening for the sound
I wanna hear her heartbeat
In the darkness every night of my life
I wanna hear a heartbeat
In the darkness   next to mine
A woman trying to find a diamond mine
Ain't my kind, she ain't no use to me
A big estate with a wrought-iron gate
A mansion on the hill, ain't where I wanna be
You see without love a house ain't a home
A diamond ain't no more than a stone in the ground
I'd give ev'ry material thing I own in this life
If I could just hear the sound
Of a heartbeat
In the darkness every night of my life
I wanna hear a heartbeat
In the darkness   next to mine
I wanna hear her heartbeat
In the darkness every night of my life
I wanna hear a heartbeat
In the darkness   next to mine
I wanna hear a heartbeat
I wanna hear a heartbeat

I'll help you clear up the mystery
I'll give you a simple rule of th umb
If it knocks you off your feet
Then it's love, then it's love
If it makes your life com plete
Then it's love, then it's love
If it turns you upside down
Then it's love, then it's love
If it makes your world go 'round
Then it's love... ooh, ooh, ooh
The dictionary won't tell you much
If love is the word you're looking up
I don't believe that the definition's right
And the en cyclopaedia won't reveal
The crazy way you start to feel
Kissing on a moonlit summer's ni ght
If it knocks you off your feet
Then it's love, then it's love
If it makes your life com plete
Then it's love, then it's love
If it turns you upside down

If it makes your world go 'round
Then it's love... ooh, ooh, ooh
So go on and say that love is a game
Maybe comp are it to a flame
Or say it's a medicine that heals
But a panel of experts could fight all night
And never figure out which one is right
But they'd agree on how it makes you feel
If it knocks you off your feet
Then it's love, then it's love
If it makes your life com plete
Then it's love, then it's love
If it turns you upside down

Describe the days events and go on home
And it's likely they won't drown

They close up all the bars downtown

He wants to hear a golden oldie to take him back
And I'll play out all the emotions I can't fight
Relive the tensions and hope they're on the right track

Florence was a waitress
Have I mentioned that before?
Serving beer to strangers and to some she'd seen before
Florence used to ride a little Apaloosa mare
In the barrel race at the rodeo, she had that beehive hair
There's a picture of her on the wall, as you pay your check
Lord, didn't she look good back in nineteen fifty six?
I was loving Florence and she was ignoring me
Florence had experience, it was the first time out for me
Lord, I tried to tell her, but the only words I found
Were ""Give me greasy enchiladas and a beer to wash it down""
Florence quit the Lone Star Hotel, and never was seen again
And me, I quit west Texas, and I ain't been back since then
That was years ago, Lord, too many to recall?
But I remember Florence and them pictures on the wall

Beneath the neon, close up has just begun.
When a boy walks in the door and points a pistol
He can't find a job with man but he has found a gun
Well he pulls it off, no trace of confrontation
He let the old man run out in the street.
But he knows soon they come, guns blazing
And all ready he can feel that great relief.
Oh how many travelers get weary
Bearing both their burdens and their scars
Don't you think they'd love to stop complaining
and fly like eagles out among the stars.
He pictures the arrival of their consternation
Sees that old familiar anger in their tears
He knows as they pull their guns and shoot this loser
They'll be aiming at the demon in their eyes.
Oh how many travelers get weary
Bearing both their burdens and their scars
Don't you think they'd love to stop complaining
And fly like eagles out among the stars
The evening news it carries all the details
As he dies in every living room in town
And in a home a bottle is thrown in anger
And his father cries ""We'll never live this down.""
Oh how many travelers get weary
Bearing both their burdens and their scars
Don't you think they'd love to stop complaining
and fly like eagles out among the stars  and
fly like eagles out among
the        stars.

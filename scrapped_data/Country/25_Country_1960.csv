0,Im Getting Better,Jim Reeves,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jim-reeves/im-getting-better-chords-3840536,"I walked by the river
Where we said goodbye
Thought of your kisses
And didn't even cry
I'm gettin' better (gettin' better)
I'm gettin' better (gettin' better)
I talked with an old friend
He asked about you
I managed to tell him
With just a tear or two
I'm gettin' better (gettin' better)
I'm gettin' better (gettin' better)
I know, I'll never be the same
I was standin' too close to the flame
But it doesn't so much to hear your name
I think I'll make it
I'm gettin' better, (gettin' better)
I walked by the same spot
Where we walked that night
I remembered your kisses
And tears dimmed my sight
I'm glad you're better
I'm glad you're better
I talked with that ol' friend
He said you're blue as can be
Now I can tell you
It's the same way with me
I'm glad you're better
I'm glad you're better
I know we'll never be the same
We both stood much too close to the flame
How I cried at the sound of your name
Don't think I'll make it
I'm glad you're better

    And he drops what he's      doin' 
And      hurries down to      meet me
And I'm          always late

For the skies they look so lazy now Heavy are the clouds
There's nothing here that I could learn Or what it's all about
You haven't said a thing to me And you talk so very loud
Looking everywhere and going nowhere
Well I think I'll try the circus Or go back to Mexico
It's time to make mistakes again It's time to change the show
It's time and time and time again To find another way
It's time to gather forces And get out of yesterday
Because I lost what I was looking for There's nothing left to share
I need to take myself away To be some other where
A face, a life, a minute more I don't think I can spare
Looking everywhere and going nowhere
Cause I tell you when you hurt me And you just don't seem to know
I inform you that I'm lonely And you still don't think I'll go

It's just the circus and I'm singing I'm never really near

If you don't care, get on your horse,

You talk about me, honey..you try to tear me down.
But while you're throwing dirt on me, you're slowly 
losing ground.
If you don't want me, baby..if you're not satisfied.
If you don't care, get on your horse,

I had your second fiddle, returned to you today..
cause, baby, that's one instrument, I've never learned to play.

He grew up on a little farm just a couple of miles out of town
As a boy he worked in his daddy's field
And when his daddy could spare him, he hired out to the neighbors
For whatever they could pay him, he was thought of as just average a good boy
Nothing more the average amount of friends
He married his high school sweetheart
They brought a little plot of ground
Couple of miles out of town on a mailbox it said
Route 1 Box 144
Well back in town there were very few people that really knew him
Because he hardly ever came to town
Except for maybe on Saturdays of course the usual crew was always there
But he didn't spent a lot of times with the usual crew, he took care of his business
Bought what he had to have or could afford for his family and went back to his little farm
With a baby on the way he went to the army and it was a short while
That the news came that he was killed in action
His body was sent back on a plane and then by train
And then they brought the body from the train station to Route 1 Box 144

He'd never been away from home before

""From where come leaves like these? ""Sequoia turned to his father's eyes
And he said, ""Father you're wise From where come such snow white leaves
Not even the wise owl could put them there So strange these snow white leaves""
His father shielding his concern Resenting the knowledge Sequoia yearned
Crumbled the snow white leaves He said, ""When I explain then it's done
The white man takes a berry of black and red
And an eagle's feather from the eagle's bed
And he makes bird track marks And the marks on the leaves they say
Carry messages to his brother far away
And his brother knows what's in his heart
They see these marks and they understand
The truth in the heart of the far off man The enemies can't hear them
Said Sequoia's father, ""Son
Then Sequoia walking lightly Followed his father quietly
If the white man talks on leaves Why not the Cherokee?
Vanished from his father's face Sequoia went from place to place
But he could not forget Year after year he worked on and on
Till finally he cut into stone The Cherokee alphabet
Sequoia's hair by now was white
That the Indian's thoughts could be written down
Just as the white men's there on the ground

Let me tell you Mr teacher when you say you'll make me right
In five hundred years of fighting, not one Indian turned white
And there are drums beyond the mountain, Indian drums that you can't hear

There's Magnus Colorado with his sleeves so red and full
Crazy Horse the legend those who bit off Custer's soul

They'll use a man for his money, when it's gone they'll 
turn him down.
They're all alike at the bottom, selfish and grasping 
for all.
They'll stay by a man when he's winning, and laugh in 
his face when he falls.
My pal was an honest young puncher, honest and upright 
and true.
Til he turned to a gun shooting gambler on account of a 
girl named Lou.
They fell in with evil companions, the kind they are 
better off dead.
When a gambler insulted her picture, he filled him full 
of lead.
All through the long night they trailed him, through mesquite 
and thick chaparral.
I couldn't help think of that woman, as I saw him pitch and fall.
If she'd been the pal that she should have, he might have been 
raising a son.
Instead of out there on the prairie, to die by a Ranger's gun.
Death's sharp sting did not trouble, his chances for life were 
too slim.
Where they were putting his body was all that worried him.
He lifted his head on his elbow, the blood from his wound 
flowed red.
He gazed at his friends gathered round him, he looked up at 
them and he said.
Bury me out on the prairie, where the coyotes can howl o'er 
my grave.
Bury me out on the prairie, but from them my bones please save.
Wrap me up in a blanket, bury me deep in the ground.
Cover me over with boulders of granite big and round.
We buried him out on the prairie, where the coyotes can howl 
o'er his grave.
His soul is now a-resting from the unkind cut she gave.
And many another young puncher, as he rides past the pile 
of stones.
Recalls some similar woman, and thinks of his mouldering bones.

I drive a new Royce Rolls, buy them tailor made clothes

A poor boy ways and hard time days 
Are just six strings away
I met a girl bout a year ago in a little country town where I played a show
And though I love her I still wonder just what she'd do

Wes Hardin is his name they say he travels in the night
For he might have to kill or walk around a  fight
And if you ever saw Wes Hardin draw you know he can skin his gun
 He won't say how many tried and died up against the top hand
 Up against the wrong man cause Hardin' wouldn't run
He rode in like a Texas wind took the eastbound train
Goin' goin' with Jane Bowen till the law men caught up
 So long Janie chin up I'll be back again
Off he went to Huntsville Prison so long Janie he cried
Fifteen years she waited till her heart broke and she died
And she left that bad land to wait up in the sky
Free at last the payin' past for all the wrong he did
First free air they let him breathe since he was a kid
So let him come and let him go and let him deal and bid
Near the border in El Paso lawyer reads the sign
You won't find him there for business every day at nine
For business is real bad one client's all he's had in quite a long long time
Then sheriff Selman's boy broke in to Wes's woman's place
Up she jumped and pistol whipped him kicked him in the face
And John Selman demands revenge for this disgrace
You could see every night by candlelight in Hardin's favorite bar
 She'd be hanging on his arm and very late they'd leave there
 Headed for the Goose Hair glad it wasn't far
Right through the swinging doors John Selman came with a blazin' gun
Wes Hardin chug-a-luggin' red eye got him in the back of the head
John Wesley Hardin fell dead cos Hardin wouldn't run

That it won't be long before its crying time
Now you say that you've found someone you love better
That's the way its happened every time before
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow
Crying time will start when you walk out the door
Oh it's crying time again your gonna leave me
I can see that far away look in your eyes
I can tell by the way you hold me darling
That it won't be long before it's crying time

0,Somebodys Always Saying Goodbye,Anne Murray,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/anne-murray/somebodys-always-saying-goodbye-chords-1760676,"Railroad station midnight trains lonely airports in the rain
And somebody stands there with tears in their eyes
It's the same old scene time after time
That's the trouble with all mankind somebody's always saying goodbye 
Taxi cabs leave in the night greyhound buses with red tail lights
Someone's leaving and someone's left behind 
Well I don't know how things got that way 
But every place you look these days somebody's always saying goodbye
Take two people like me and you
We could have made it we just quit too soon 
Oh the two of us we could have had it all if we'd only tried
But that's the way love is it seems 
Just when you've got a real good thing somebody's always saying goodbye
Somebody's always saying goodbye

I could not get to sleep..try as I may.
But now you're back..and you're here to stay...

Just as long as you are holdin' me tight.
Makin' love 'til the early morning light,
only whets our appetite.

This time he sure drew a bad one
One that nobody could ride
But by the way he pulled his hat on
You knew he'd be there for the fight
And it's the classic contradiction
The unavoidable affliction
Well it don't take much to predict son
The way it always goes
'Cause one day she'll say she loves you
And the next she'll be tired of you
And push'll always come to shove you
On that midnight rodeo
He almost made it to the buzzer
Somehow he gave up in the end
He put one hand around the other
And let that pickup man on in
And it was his last chance to ride her
And now he'll have to move along
But he knows back in his mind that

Hey, what's your plan?
Where do you stand?
It's time for commitments
It's time for a showing of hands
Hey, what's your plan?
Where do you stand?
Surely there's someone with courage
To say where he stands
Hey, what's your plan?
Where do you stand?
Where do you stand?
Where do you stand?
Hey, what's your plan?
Where do you stand?
Where do you stand?
Where do you stand?
Hey, what's your plan?
Where do you stand?

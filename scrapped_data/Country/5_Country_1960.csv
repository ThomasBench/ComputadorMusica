0,Streets Of Laredo (ver 2),Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/streets-of-laredo-chords-2525316,"As I walked out on the streets of Laredo
As I walked out on Laredo one day
I spied a young cowboy all wrapped in white linen
Wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay
""I can see by your outfit that you are a cowboy""
These words he did say as I boldly walked by
""Come and sit down beside me and hear my sad story
I'm shot in the breast and I know I must die""
""It was once in the saddle, I used to go dashing
Once in the saddle, I used to go gay
First to the card-house and then down to Rose's
But I'm shot in the breast and I'm dying today
Get six jolly cowboys to carry my coffin
Six dance-hall maidens to bear up my pall
Throw bunches of roses all over my coffin
Roses to deaden the clods as they fall""
""Then beat the drum slowly, play the Fife lowly
Play the dead march as you carry me along
Take me to the green valley, lay the sod o'er me
I'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong""
""Then go write a letter to my grey-haired mother
And tell her the cowboy that she loved has gone
But please not one word of the man who had killed me
Don't mention his name and his name will pass on""
When this he had spoken, the hot sun was setting
The streets of Laredo grew cold as the clay
We took the young cowboy down to the green valley
And there stands his marker we made to this day
We beat the drum slowly, play the Fife lowly
Play the dead march as we carried him along
Down in the green valley, lay the sod over him
He was a young cowboy and he said he'd done wrong

1,Elusive Butterfly,Glen Campbell,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/glen-campbell/elusive-butterfly-chords-1789666,"You might wake up some morning.
To the sound of something moving 
past your window in the wind.
And if you're quick enough to rise
you'll catch the fleeting glimpse 
of someone's fading shadow.
Out on the new   horizon, you may see
the floating motions of a 
distant pair of wings.
And if the sleep has left your ears
you might hear footsteps running 
through an open meadow.
Don't be concerned, 
it will not harm you.
It's only me pursuing something 
I'm not sure of.
Across my dreams,   with nets of wonder.
I chase the bright elusive 
butterfly of love.
You might have heard my footsteps. 
Echo softly in the distance through 
the canyons of your mind.
I might have even called your name
as I ran searching after something 
to believe in.
You might have seen me running. 
Through the long abandoned ruins of 
the dreams you left behind.
If you remember something there
that glided past you followed 
close by heavy breathing.
Don't be concerned, 
it will not harm you.
It's only me pursuing something 
I'm not sure of.
Across my dreams,  with nets of wonder.
I chase the bright elusive 
butterfly of loveeee.
I chase the butterfly of love.

If you will but go with me one summer season's through
But if you should get homesick and back to Griffin go
Then I'll furnish you no horses from the hills of Mexico

When all the world was lovely and everything was gay
With saddles on our horses marching onward we did go
Until we reached Old Boggy out in New Mexico
It was there our pleasures ended and our troubles they began
The first hailstorm fell on us, those cattle how they ran
Through all the thorns and thistles the cowboys had to go
While the Indians watched upon us out in New Mexico
And when the drive was over the rider would not pay

And that tears are only rain to make love grow

That's the way its happened every time before
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow
Crying time will start when you walk out the door
Oh it's crying time again your gonna leave me

Bear tracks, bear tracks lookin' back at me.
You better get your rifle boy before it's too late,
Cause the bear's got a little pig, and headed through the gate.
He's big around the middle, and he's broad across the rump.
Runnin' ninety miles an hour takin' thirty feet a jump.
He ain't never been caught he ain't never been treed,
And some folks say he look a lot like me.
Ole Slew Foot, he's a mighty, mighty bear;
Feet like tubs and long brown hair.
He's 'leven feet tall, and he's twenty feet around,
He's headed up the mountain, boys, so whistle up the hounds.
He's big around the middle, and he's broad across the rump.
Runnin' ninety miles an hour takin' thirty feet a jump.
He ain't never been caught, he ain't never been treed,
And some folks say he look a lot like me.
I saved up my money, and I bought me some bees,
And they started makin' honey way up in the trees.
Cut down the trees, but my honey's all gone,
Old Slew Foot's done made himself at home.
He's big around the middle, and he's broad across the rump.
Runnin' ninety miles an hour takin' thirty feet a jump.
Ain't never been caught, he ain't never been treed,
And some folks say he look a lot like me.
Winter's comin' on, and it's twenty below,
And the river's froze over, so where can he go.
We'll chase him up the gully, then we'll run him in the well,
And shoot him in the bottom just to listen to him yell.
He's big around the middle, and he's broad across the rump.

Makin' music on my guitar,
Got the same old story at them all night piers,

Roamed a thousand miles of track,
Til I found myself in Mobile Alabama,

I showed 'em what a band would sound like,

What would he think if he saw her this way?
She picks up her apron in little girl-fashion as something comes into her mind
Slowly starts dancing rememb'ring her girlhood
And all of the boys she had waiting in line
Oh, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife
You see ev'rywhere any time of the day
An everyday housewife who gave up the good life for me
The photograph album she takes from the closet and slowly turns the page
And carefully picks up the crumbling flower
The first one he gave her now withered with age
She closes her eyes and touches the house dress that suddenly disappears
And just for the moment she's wearing the gown
That broke all their minds back so many years
Oh, such are the dreams of the everyday housewife

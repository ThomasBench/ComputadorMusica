0,Not To Blame,Bella White,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bella-white/not-to-blame-chords-3618161,"It's hard to watch you look away from me
though I know I'm not to   blame.
The rivers thawed but you're still frozen,
the words I write to you are still the same.
Why do you always get to be the child?
We all want to play those foolish games.
I've watched the time melt on  by now,
dripping down on me again
I may as well have been a winding road.
You walked all on me just the same.
Like a little girl with wide eyes and curls
I didn't know it was just a game.
Like a little girl with wide eyes and curls
I didn't know it was just a game.
I hate the way you always make me feel.
Well I hate feeling at all.
You act as if you got the best of me,
but we both know you're acting small.
Why do you always get to be the child?
Your mama brought you up that way.
But I was raised to turn the other cheek
and now all I'm left with is my own shame.
I may as well have been a winding road.
You walked all on me just the same.
Like a little girl with wide eyes and curls
I didn't know it was just a game.
Like a little girl with wide eyes and curls
I didn't know it was just a game.
I may as well have been a winding road.
You walked all on me just the same.
Like a little girl with wide eyes and curls
I didn't know it was just a game.
Like a little girl with wide eyes and curls
I didn't know it was just a game.

They can try to hold us under
But we won’t be ruled by thieves
Crooked roads and plastic flowers
No good liquor in this town
Paper walls around shiny towers
But the truth will bring them down

More lies told
Promises broken
Lifeblood sold
When they come to take our brothers away
With their drugs and chains of gold
Let’s roll down to that green river
Wade right in and touch their souls
Grab your coat and bring a hammer along
We can break this world of sin
All the flowers have died around us
But they’ll rise and bloom again

Smoked cigarettes for his lungs,
He loved women for his ego
He died a rounder at twenty one
He never worked down at the saw mill
He couldn't stand that bright sunshine
He lived twenty one years in his life
It was a thousand in his time
It was a night when the blues had hit him,
He must have drank three fifths of rum
He got mad as hell when I told him
You'll never live past twenty one
Well if a man ever hit me harder
I don't know where or when
He picked me up off of the bar floor
He said I'd like to be your friend
The other night I overheard him talkin'
To an old man at the bar
He said oh Daddy I love you,
I just don't like where you are
Tell Mama to turn my light on,
And turn down my feather bed.
I'll be twenty one tomorrow
But tomorrow, he was dead.
There were twenty one miles to the graveyard,
And twenty one roses red,
This is the story of a rounder
Who at twenty one he was dead
He drank whiskey for his liver
He Smoked cigarettes for his lungs
He loved the women for his ego
He died a rounder at twenty one
He died a rounder at twenty one
He died a rounder at tweeeeeeeeenty one.

I wasn't raised to give up

Been knocked down but never out of the fight

And let me tell you when it comes to love
 I'm still woman enough
I was raised in Oklahoma
Hey, I'm country and proud to say
I'vе seen a lot of changes
Oh, but I ain't never changеd
Well, this here girl's been there and done that
They called me hillbilly but I got the last laugh
Standing here today, proving in every way
 I'm still woman enough, still got what it takes inside
I know how to love, lose, and survive
Ain't much I ain't seen, I ain't tried
I've been knocked down but never out of the fight
I'm strong but I'm tender, wise but I'm tough
And let me tell you when it comes to love
 I'm still woman enough

But for me it's just time
'Cause without a doubt I know
It ain't your age, it's your state of mind

No morirán las memorias

Antes de abrir o meu coração
E aprender a dor do amor
 Sentia-me seguro
Contemplando o céu
A tua voz, como o som das ondas
Trouxe-me até este porto seguro

G  Gaddb3  (x3)
My buddy's old man is back on the booze,
He's swinging a driver at a big bull moose,
That keeps gettin' on the goddamn property,
Or so he says.
Cigarettes are expensive and whisky ain't cheap,
Winters are bitter, but the summers are sweet,
And you can get some honestly-priced smokes over at the rez,
If you're so inclined.
Most of my time's spent in a big blue van,
Just travellin' the country with a five-piece band,
Pick a little for the folks and sing when I can,
Granted, I'm sober.
And other days are meant for chorin',
Just workin' at the ranch to stave off boredom,
And keepin' the calves from finding new ways to keel over,
Just livin' the dream.
I was coolin' my heels down in Tennessee,
Post ’82 some buddies and me,
And we were shootin' the shit,
Till we ran outta ammunition.
Some dude overheard from across the room,
And instead of mindin’ his own he just assumed,
He'd sit down next us and join in on the conversation,
Brought over some kinda beer,       something called a IPA.
He’s a Nashville kid in a cowboy hat,
And he couldn’t tell a shoelace from a lariat,
And the furthest west he’d ever been was Ohio.
He’s talkin’ to me says he’s looking for work,
And he didn’t mind gettin’ some dirt on his shirt,
And would I be so kind as to hire him on, ""well oh my oh"",
Surprised he didn’t bring a resume.
He said but if you’re doin' fence, then I ain’t for hire,
And if you’re doin' hay, then frankly I wouldn’t conspire,
To ask me about doin' that either.
I said “what are you good for?” and he said ""Plenty"",
I could see this conversation wasn’t going any which way,
And figured I’d do well just to leave here,
So long buddy,                       keep your IPAs.
Yeah, this city life has sure got me tired,
And it’s hard for a prairie boy to admire,
All the concrete and the towerin’ skyscrapers.
So just as soon as I’m able to find my hat,
I believe I’ll leave and head on back home,
Where the tallest buildings are all grain elevators,
Long gone to Saskatchewan.
Yeah, I’m outta this place and bound for the farm,
And I’m not takin' no greenhorn along,
I have a hard enough time just keepin’ track of myself,
But if you’re down in Nashville and tryin’ to look cool,
But you can’t tell a pretty palomino from a mule,
Take my advice and leave the buckaroo hat on the shelf.
Heh, heh, heh.

Why’d you come draggin’ in here?
Now sit-down boy before you hurt yourself
And I’ll let you bend my ear
Love is a bitch, ain’t it buddy
When baby turns the tables on your head
I know you came in here to bring back her leaving
I’ll leave you with this instead
I know every hole in the Clinch River
And I know how to find them bass
I know how to tune a six string Martin
And kick Saturday in the ass
I know how to make that moon shine
I know you want your sunshine back
I know a whole lotta ‘bout a lil’ somethin’, somethin’
And a whole bunch of nothing ‘bout that
A whole bunch of nothing ‘bout that
Before my mind took a vacation
I had a situation like you got
They tell me that I had a good woman gone bad
But I can’t remember what I forgot
Now just kick back and listen up son
I’ll help you get to where I am
Get you going full throttle, and leanin’ on the bottle
And some bait in a coffee can
I know every hole in the Clinch River
And I know how to find them bass
I know how to tune a six string Martin
And kick Saturday in the ass
I know how to make that moon shine
I know you want your sunshine back
I know a whole lotta ‘bout a lil’ somethin’, somethin’
And a whole bunch of nothing ‘bout that
A whole bunch of nothing ‘bout that
I know where to go   and you know how to get there
Off you go, hit the road buzz and a pole, a wing and a prayer
I know every hole in the Clinch River
And I know how to find them bass
I know how to tune a six string Martin
And kick Saturday in the ass

In a sundress on a blanket
Soft kiss on your face

Looks up at the city sky

47,Mad Man,Eric Church,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/eric-church/mad-man-chords-3670262,"He's a modern day Jekyll and Hyde, mixin’ pride with the cold hard facts
Starin’ awful hard at a picture on a bar of a girl that he won't get back
He's talkin’ to himself knowin’ damn well his self doesn't know what now
'Xcept fire shots of Jack and popping caps of Silver Bullets in his mouth
He's a mad man at the world
‘Cause a girl told him good-bye
His thumbs up has been grounded
Now it’s that bird he loves to fly
Might be happy hour to you
But his mind ain’t nowhere near there
It’s busy goin’ crazy on the heels of her Mercedes
Drivin’ back home north of eighty towards the badlands
He’s still holdin’ on    like a mad man
He ain't lookin’ for a fight but that might be what ya get
If you light that fuse that looks to you like a half-smoked ciga-rette
Just leave his glass half empty, he's better off left alone
Kind of like a house up the road, the lights are on but no one’s home
He's a mad man at the world
‘Cause a girl told him good-bye
His thumbs up has been grounded
Now it’s that bird he loves to fly
Might be happy hour to you
But his mind ain’t nowhere near there
It’s busy goin’ crazy on the heels of her Mercedes
Drivin’ back home north of eighty towards the badlands
He’s still holdin’ on    like a mad...   ...man
Yeah like a mad man,     mad man,    like a mad, mad man

48,When You Go,Esther Rose,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/esther-rose/when-you-go-chords-3672203,"She's a little mess, you watch her get undressed
As I lay me down to rest in his bed
Steady as you go with her down that road
And I hope to someday know what's in your head
You watch your spirit fly away into the sky
And you said you cried the whole way home
Well me, I kind of like this wild and stormy night
And I think I might just let you go...
But can I come with you
I want to go with you
When you go
Can I come with you
Please take me with you
When you go
Do you ever feel that none of this is real?
Maybe you're just in the other room
Well I hope you're happy now cause you gotta try somehow
We know that we can't blame it on the moon
When I lost you that night the stars were in your eyes
Crying to each other in the street
Well I guess your little lie was the last of our goodbyes
And my friend I know someday we'll meet...
But can I come with you
I want to go with you
When you go
Can I come with you
Please take me with you
When you go
Can I come with you
I want to go with you
When you go

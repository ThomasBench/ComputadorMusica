0,The Songwriters,Willie Nelson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/willie-nelson/the-songwriters-chords-3185459,"We get to break out of prison
Make love to our best friend's wife
Have a beer for breakfast in Boston
Drink rum in Jamaica that night
We get to tell all our secrets
In a code no one understands
We get to shoot all the bad guys
But never get blood on our hands
We're heroes, we're schemers,
We're drunks and we're dreamers
We're lovers and sometimes we're fighters
We're students, we're teachers
We're the devil, we're preachers
We're true love but mostly one nighters
We're the songwriters
Half the world thinks we're crazy
The other half wants to be us
And they're jealous because we get to hang out
In the back of some big stars tour bus
We're old boots and tee shirts and blue jeans
We're capos and strings and E Chords
We only dress up in November
When they hand out some writers awards
We're heroes, we're schemers,
We're drunks and we're dreamers
We're lovers and sometimes we're fighters
We're the truth, we're the lies
We're stupid, we're wise
We're true love but mostly one nighters
We're the songwriters
We ride bridges, we cross 'em and burn 'em
Teach lessons but don't bother to learn 'em
Our mamas don't know what we're doing
Why we stay out all night long
I told mine I was a drug dealer
She said thank god you ain't writin' songs
We're heroes, we're schemers,
We're drunks and we're dreamers
We're lovers and sometimes we're fighters
We're the truth, we're the lies
We're stupid, we're wise
We're true love but mostly one nighters
We're the songwriters
We're the songwriters

1,A Womans Touch,Tom Jones,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tom-jones/a-womans-touch-chords-3667370,"Right from the first day one man stood alone
And somehow he missed what didn't exist how could he have known
He looked all around him and lifted his head
For he heard a voice and rose to rejoice as somebody said
This place needs a woman's touch
To share in the plan
For without a woman's touch
Life don't mean much to a man
Up through the ages, the story's the same
A king to himself, alone with his wealth is living in vain
His castle will crumble and he'll wonder why
'Cause wealthy or poor, there's one thing for sure, he just can't deny
This place needs a woman's touch
To share in the plan
For without a woman's touch
Life don't mean much to a man
I was a drifter who couldn't be tamed
So reckless and wild but lost like a child
Whose dreams never came
Then I felt the pleasures of love's happiness
One look in her eyes and I realized
I've truly been blessed
Thank God for a woman's touch
To share in the plan
For it took my woman's touch
To make me feel like a man
Thank God for a woman's touch
To share in the plan
For it took my woman's touch
To make me feel like a man

apricots preserved in jars,  that's my home
Land of oceans in the sun, purple hazes  river gum
breaks your heart when rain won't come, it breaks your heart
It takes a harsh and cruel drought
to sort the weaker saplings out
it makes room for stronger trees       
maybe that's what life's about
Winter's come, the hills are brown 
shops are closed  the blinds are down
everybody's leavin' town   they can't go on
The south wind through veranda gauze
whines and bangs the homestead doors
a mother curses dusty floors  and feels alone
Trucks and bulk bins filled with rust  
boy leaves home to make a crust
a father's dreams reduced to dust  but he must go on
Tortured red gums unashamed
sunburnt country wisely named
chisel-ploughed and wire claimed       
but never never never tamed
Whirlwind swirls a paper high  same old news of further dry
of broken clouds just passing by that's my home
Land of oceans in the sun purple hazes river gum
breaks your heart when rain won't come it breaks your heart

For who I am has long been tied and tangled up in her
And it isn't luck or chance she can read me at a glance
Not just because she's clever and she's smart
No it's just by now she knows my heart by heart
It seems like it's been centuries since she and I began
And both of us took all our chances on a single hand
Though we took it day to day it's gone from year to year
And no one ever close to me was ever half as near
And it isn't any trick or because her mind is quick
She reaches my conclusions as I start
No it's just by now she knows my heart by heart
And amazing as it seems she brings magic to my dreams
Not just because she's mastered magic's art
No it's just by now she knows my heart by heart

She was something most amazin' to my inexperienced eyes
But the fact was clearly stated she and Big Dupree was mated
And a dreadful fate awaited anyone who touched his bride
Cause he said it loud and clear for all the town to hear
And he nailed it up for all the town to see
That the man who puts his hand upon the hand of Hoddy Holly
Will feel the heavy hand of Big Dupree
But that dangerous situation worked on my imagination
And passin' up temptation ain't the thing that I do best
And you know the way things happened one night Dupree was out trappin'
And I spent the evening nappin' with her head upon my chest
Then the roar come from a door six foot four maybe more
He stood standin' there and starin' right at me
He said boy you put your hand upon the hand of Hoddy Holly
Now you'll feel the heavy hand of Big Dupree
Then crazed by ragin' passion he come dashin' smashin' crashin'
And I felt his blade come slashin' through my shrieks and screams and groans
And there just ain't nothin' worse than what he done to my person
And I spend these evenings a cursin' him in slightly higher tones
Cause he said it loud and clear for all the town to hear
And he nailed it up for all the town to see
That the man who puts his hand upon the hand of Hoddy Holly
Will feel the heavy hand of Big Dupree

I'll take you off sailing from midnight 'til noon 
I'll show the Sea of Tranquility 
You can have any flavour you happen see
I live in the shade of a forest of green 
In the wildest of woodlands that you've ever seen 
There's rabbits and quail and tender young snails 
As brown as the seaweed on old rusty nails
There's fireflies dancing in the cool evening breeze 
There's love and romancing as nice as you please 
There's otters and frogs and spotted groundhogs 
And wily old weasels in rotted out logs
There's rivers of rainbow and grey mountain trout
And little dark holes where the varmints hang out 
There's foxes and hares in traps and in snares 
And lots of bald eagles so you'd better take care
So, if you've got the time and you'd like to pass by 
Come down around midnight and give us a try 
We'll show you the Sea of Tranquility 
You can have any flavour you happen to see

Was it some kind of an ocean of changes?

And since I don't know, let me guess
Was it somewhere in Michigan or the Lake of the Woods
Up in old Montreal  or Toronto the good
Somewhere in Reno or somewhere in Rome
And when all is said and done
Will she leave me alone?
I don't want to get so low
And as for my sadness, it comes and it goes
I don't remember where she said she would be
Back in the city or on the high seas
Was it up in Hornpayne where the trains run on time
Was she drinking champagne when she made up her mind?
North of the border or down in South Bend
And when all is said and done
Is there no    rainbow's end?
I don't want to own the key
To some ghostly mansion where souls are set free

Hell pay you for your misery or hell sell you someone's pain
And that twinkle in his greedy eye  says your loss will be his gain.
She stood back in the shadows as the broker dealt with me
Her eyes were dark and desperate from some private misery.
His words were so prophetic when he said you got a steal
I said throw in one bullet  and you got yourself a deal.

All you got to be is twenty-one or fifteen if you lie.
Just hand the man money and if some ones gotta die
  The broker in the pawnshop     won't even blink an eye.
Well, he handed me the pistol and I was almost to the door
When I heard him tell the lady seven dollars nothing more.
The lady started crying as he took her wedding band
Well, my hand was in my pocket    and the gun was in my hand.
Well I was gonna use that bullet   to end my life
I was once somebody's husband she was once somebody's wife.
Well, I usually mind my business, but I could not walk away
His dollars just weren't making sense    and I knew I had to stay.
Well, the brokers face turned pasty when he caught my icy stare
It would never leave my pocket, but he knew the gun was there.
I asked him what his life was worth and he opened up that drawer

You say hello, (hello) how are you
You're doing well it seems.
I wish I was better at bein' alone
I wish I was still in your dreams.
I spent a lot of lonely hours staring at this phone of mine
Knowing your just a heart beat down the line
Once I even dialed your number, but I couldn't let it ring
What do you say to a sweet memory.
You say hello, (hello) how are you
You're doing well it seems.
I wish I was better at bein' alone
I wish I was still in your dreams.
In my favorite fantasy
You're the one who's missing me
It all comes back so easily
 When I hear you say.
You say hello, (hello) how are you
You're doing well it seems.
I wish I was better at bein' alone
I wish I was still in your dreams.

I knew that it wouldn't be easy
For my heart to find somebody new
But I never thought
It still would be broken in two
These years after you

And it seems like a million days
I still remember the taste of your kisses
And your eyes that were beautifully blue
And I can still hear the sound of your voice
When you said we were thru
Years after you
Years after years after you
I'm still cryin'
Tears after years after you
I'm still tryin' to make it thru
These years after you
There've been mornings when I couldn't wake up
Then I'll break down and cry for a week
Cause when I told you I'd love you forever
I know you didn't think it was true

31,The Highway,Willie Nelson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/willie-nelson/the-highway-chords-4163269,"  I drove in on the four lane where the two lane used to be,
the highway hummed a near forgotten tune from 1963.
The year I turned 18 and set my sights and heard the highway call,
now the highway's come full circle to a place I scarce recall.
There's a girl I still remember whose name I can't recall,
  I gave her what I had but then   she tried to take it all.
I stayed long enough to love her and then left her on the run,
like a flower left to wither in that deep east Texas sun.
There's a place out on the highway where I go to spend my time,
where the bartenders all know me and the players are friends of mine.
Then we light up on the breaks   and talk of things that we all know,
but I've heard it all before   and I'll hear it all again,
  and I've heard it said:   the highway never ends.
So, what about old ""Handsome Johnny"" and the class of '64?
  Did the women all make promises when they shipped him off to war?
  Did his Momma get the medal   and did his country ever win?
Well, let's drink a round for Johnny 'cause he died for all our sins.
They're still down there in the factories,   you can see them in the mills,
they've sweated there for years, Lord,   I guess they always will.
  And you know they won't be leavin', I can't watch them die that way,
  so, in my rear view mirror I always watch 'em slip away.

43,Child Of God,David Allan Coe,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/david-allan-coe/child-of-god-chords-3806333,"My grandpa was a fisher man
Just like my dad and me
My brother was a fisher of men
On the sea-ea of Galilee
My daddy was an honest man
  He never owned a gun
My brother came from Nazareth
  Outside Jerusalem
My daddy was a factory man up in O-hi-o
My brother's dad was a carpenter
Two thousand years ago
My grandpa was a holy man
  He read The Good Book through
My daddy was a gentle man
My brother was a Jew
My grandpa was a fisher man
Just like my dad and me
My brother was a fisher of men
On the sea of Galilee
My grandpa was a holy man
  He read The Good Book through
My daddy was a gentle man
My brother was a Jew
Daddy’s gonna see again,
Daddy’s gonna see
Daddy’s light will shine
Above the sea of Galilee
Halleluiah Jesus
Save your sole and set him free
Daddy’s been blind all his life
Now Daddy’s gonna see
And the circle won’t be broken
By and by Lord by and by
Daddy’s gonna hear again
Daddy’s gonna hear
The boats out in the harbor
And the words of Moses clear
Halleluiah Jesus
Opened up my daddy’s ears
Daddy’s been deaf all his life
Now daddy’s gonna hear
Daddy’s born again sweet Jesus
Daddy’s born again
I spread daddy’s ashes
On the ocean in the wind
Halleluiah Jesus
Forgive on my daddy’s sins
Daddy’s been deaf all his life
Now Daddy’s born again
Now the circle won’t be broken
By and by Lord by and by
Just as long as my daddy’s waiting
Waiting on the end of sky

44,Wild Irish Rose,David Allan Coe,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/david-allan-coe/wild-irish-rose-chords-1878574,"My daddy would not go to work on mornings
He’d been out with Jack Daniel’s  all night long
Though daddy never cared too much for dancing
He loved to hear a good ol’ country song.
And son, he said, I never had much money
And I never had the time for fancy clothes
And I’ve always been a fool for Jim Beam whiskey
And I guess I’ve always loved Wild Irish Rose.
Yes daddy was a gambler
My daddy loved the racetrack
What he saw in that God only knows
He loved his wife and children
But he also loved the horses
And I guess he always loved Wild Irish Rose.
My daddy always cried the morning after
Mom 'n him had argued for so long
He said, when I do right no one remembers
And for sure no one forgets when I do wrong.
But momma she accused my dad of cheating
She swore that she could smell it on his clothes
So finally dad confessed his sins to momma
And he told her all about Wild Irish Rose.
Yes daddy was a gambler
My daddy loved the racetrack
What he saw in that God only knows
He loved his wife and children
But he also loved the horses
And I guess he always loved Wild Irish Rose.

She loved me so but I loved her so wrong
I gave her too much of too little too long
So tell me bottle are the th ings I hear true
I need your help this memory's so strong
I gave her too much of too little too long
Sometimes a man can get lost in a world of his own
He'll neglect his real world who's waiting at home
A woman needs her man's love to lean on

Like the colors on a pinwheel
Spinning around turning away
Colors of your eyes
Tell me you're changing
Tell me your leaving
And that's too late to try
Diamonds and sand
Slide through your hands
Like you've done through mine
Did I look away
Or did I never say
How I needed you
Colors of your heart
Like the places you're going
There's no way of knowing
What did I do so wrong
Diamonds and sand

Like you've done through mine
Did I look away
Or did I never say
How I needed you
Colors of your eyes
Like the blues in a bottle
Taking you down
Let them wash you away

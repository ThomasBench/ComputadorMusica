0,Beautiful Crazy (ver 3),Luke Combs,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/luke-combs/beautiful-crazy-chords-3076259,"Her day starts with a coffee and ends with a wine
Takes forever getting ready so she's never on time for anything
When she gets that ""come get me"" look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild
When she drives me wild
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me
She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind
Says, ""Let's stay on the couch and watch TV""
And she falls asleep
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy but her crazy's beautiful to me
She's unpredictable, unforgettable
It's unusual, unbelievable
How I'm such a fool, yeah, I'm such a fool for her
Beautiful, crazy, she can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve
Yeah, she's crazy, she's crazy, she's crazy

1,From A Lovers Point Of View,Zach Bryan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/zach-bryan/from-a-lovers-point-of-view-chords-2880077,"You don't have to drink tonight
Why don't you just get some sleep
Cause I'm tired of cryin' in driveways
As you slur the words you speak
And I know that growing up
Has been an evil thing to you
Makes you awfully hard to love
From a lover's point of view
And I'll never understand
How you wound up in the shape you're in
But I'll always be the fool that fell for you
And your burning skin
I'll be praying for you
And pining for you
and hoping you get some rest
From a lover's point of view
It's all been hard to watch at best
Cause from where I'm standing
You got a long climb ahead
And I will wipe the vomit
when you cannot lift your head
Cause a lover doesn't leave
When times like these get dark
I'll be there to watch the sunrise
When we reclaim your heart
And I will pick you up downtown
When you're grinning with a busted lip
Cause you're not known for backing down
And those boys are known for talking shit
And now's about the time love
You really got to decide
Are you gonna be a good man to me
Or die the way your mother died
Cause from where I'm standing
You got a long climb ahead
And I will wipe the vomit
when you cannot lift your head
Cause a lover doesn't leave
When times like these get dark
I'll be there to watch the sunrise
When we reclaim your heart
You don't have to drink tonight
Why don't we just get some sleep
Cause I'm tired of crying in driveways
As you slur the words you speak

2,Maggies Song,Chris Stapleton,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/chris-stapleton/maggies-song-chords-3420032," Let me tell you a story
About an old friend   of mine
 Somebody left her in a shopping cart
 In a parking lot for us   to find
 Just a fuzzy black pup
She was hungry and feeling alone
 We put her in the back seat
And told her we were taking her home
Run, Maggie run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie run
Be just as free as you are   wild
 A few kids later
We moved out on   the farm
 And she followed those kids around
 Yeah, she kept them safe   from harm
 And she loved to chase squirrels
And playing out in   the snow
 She'd take off like a bullet
Man,  you should have seen her go
Run, Maggie run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie run
Be just as free as you are   wild
 It was raining on a Monday
The day that Maggie died
 She woke up and couldn't use her legs
So I laid down by   her side
 She put her head on my hand
Like she'd done so many times
 I told her she was a good dog
Then I told her goodbye
Run, Maggie run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie run
Be just as free as you are   wild
 I had a revelation
As the tractor dug a hole
 I can tell you right now
 That a dog has a soul
 And I thought to myself
As we buried her on   the hill
 I never knew me a better dog
And I guess I never will
Run, Maggie run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie run
Be just as free as you are wild
Oh, run, Maggie run
With the heart of a rebel child
Oh, run, Maggie run
Be just as free as you are   wild

4,Kalahari Down,Orville Peck,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/orville-peck/kalahari-down-chords-4117837,"I was born in the badlands, honey
Strange place for a boy to drown
Spent my days on a mountain, baby
Twelve miles north of Sofiatown
You’ve been gone away, I’ve been riding around
Running out the days, writing out a song
On my daddy’s guitar
Did you find your way? Skip another town?
Yippee ki yi yay, I’m always down
Left to borrow, gone tomorrow
Baby, there ain't a trail to follow
Better off alone if you ask me
Travel lucky, Kawasaki
Maybe, next time I'll take you with me
And I still hear the sound
The wind come up, Kalahari down
Polish in your whip, never drove it far
Circling the veld, spittin' in the jar
On your Daddy's farm
You say you're afraid, tell me not to frown
Yippee yo ki yay, we'd hit the ground
What do I know? Buncha sorrow
Promises of a desperado
Through the rusty sky I feel the breeze
Where do we go? Mendocino?
Maybe some day I'll get to see all
The places like Torino's never been
And I still hear the sound
Wind come up, Kalahari down
Left to roam on a reckless wander
Raising sand on the setting sun
Keep an eye on that dusty highway
Tell my mother I'm nearly done

To know what a heart really needs
and I'm finding out love
If I was not my mama's boy
Leave you crying in this car
punch a hole in your damn dashboard
And we've been fighting for so long,
It'd be s shame to let this go
But i'd rather let it lie than
And it's gettin dark now
So won't you just staay
And I'll tell you that I love you
Till the leaving leaves this house
Nah we ain't going out
Till I make some promises I can't keep
And I wish I could explain
How the toxins in my brain
Get me so damn down sometimes I can't speak
Try to understand why I can't be a better man
But it's hard when I'm yellin at you in the street
But if leaving comes to stay
and you walk yourself away
Leave knowing that no one could love you more than me
And I hope the world don't mind all the simple things I ask
Like a porch with good lighting and to hear my lady laugh
And I'll act indifferent because I don't wanna leave
Cause leaving's for a younger man that I don't wanna be

Nah we ain't going out

 Dusty bottles pour a finer glass of wine
 An old beat-up guitar just sounds better
 And wisdom only comes with time
 I can spot mistakes before they happen
 Separate the BS from the truth
 I'm learnin' when I need to keep my mouth shut
Like I couldn't in my wild and wasted youth
 Don't get me wrong
 It's good bein' young
 But there's somethin' to be said for getting wrinkles
Every song worth singin's got those lines
And there's nothin' you can do, it's gonna happen
Sit down and drink a beer with fathеr time
 Don't get me wrong
I miss bеin' young
 But there's somethin' to be said for getting older
And agin' seems to mellow out the mind
 Memories are made to sip and savour

22,Love And Regret,Billy Strings,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/billy-strings/love-and-regret-chords-3887012,"Down by the river
The water’s cold
Used to have a girl but that’s alright
She came to me in a dream
And slipped away like a running stream
The hours of silence
In the light of the moon
Brings to me a sense of ease
There’s nothing else that I could do
For that woman won't be pleased
I see her running
But I’m not the same
I’ve chased after pleasure
To bury my pain
But it’s resurrected
When I say her name
My love and regret are one in the same
The scream of a raven
The screech of an owl
A heartbroke and lonesome coyote howl
Those old Hartford records that we used to play
And the silence when she went away
A flower illustrated in bloom
Floating on a wisp of consciousness
She rides innocently down the river to
The place where the light lives
And shrugs off enchantment with a sigh
Dreaming from the first moment of her life
Unheard songs bathed in silver ring out as
Morning rolls into the endless
I see her running
But I’m not the same
I’ve chased after pleasure
To bury my pain
But it’s resurrected
When I say her name
My love and regret are one in the same
I keep wandering back
To a place in my mind
Where moonlight reflections return to her eyes
To gaze at the water once more
Before turning again to the sky
Down by the river
The water’s cold
Used to have a girl but that’s alright
She came to me in a dream
And slipped away like a running stream

You were napping on my arms on a Sunday afternoon

And cut sequoias till it's dark.
And every hour's fourteen dollars or a chance closer to her
Then I'm not just a working mule, I'm the finest of the herd.
And I don't know who she is or if she might exist
But if she does I swear to love I'm destined for that kiss.
And how's a man get so homesick for a face he's never seen?
I close my eyes while sweating and think of boys I could've been.
But I know that it's not over 'cause I can feel her here somewhere
Through these trees and melodies that I'm belting to the air.

Got no idea where it goes when it leaves,
When it’s here, it’s here,
When it’s gone, it’s gone,
Kinda like them smoky mountain fall time trees.
I guess I’ll leave it to something bigger to figure it all out,
But I sure could use a little breeze right now.
Yeah, if anybody out there somewhere,
Got a secret they want to share,
On why it does to her what it does to dust,
Really just ain’t fair,
Why it always takes her with it,
And only brings her back now and then,
I guess I’ve always been,
Wonderin’ bout the wind.
She sits there like a feather just waitin’ on a gale,
By the time I pushed off she already caught sail,
I’m always waiting to put my anchor down,
But I sure could use a little breeze right now.

I've been a rolling stone, the tumbleweed
Waiting for the right one to come find me
But the wrong one always set me free
I wish I was in his arms tonight
Is he playing in some house band in Dallas?
Is he breaking horses in San Anton?
Is he all alone in the neon light?

She comes through to me in any kind of weather
And I know I’ll never see a brighter day when she smiles with her eyes
Even with a clouded heart chalked full of doubt
She can sing away the worry of rejection
She’s a wonder to behold, I’ll love her till I’m growin' old and that’s the plan
But if I could find more that’s worthy
I’d surrender it all
Not sure that I deserve the love that I recеive
But I give it all to her
Captivating whеn she moves across the floor
I remember what it is I came here for
And it seems so easy now
I can’t believe it but somehow, I’ve made her mine
Every now and then the past will ring a bell
But I’m not looking back I’m only moving forward
If I knew then what I do now
I wouldn’t be here anyhow, but it’s been clear
But if I could find more that’s worthy
I’d surrender it all
Not sure that I deserve the love that I recеive
But I give it all to her
So if I come to some conclusion by tonight
I’ll be free from all the sorrow I’ve been drinking
Swear I’ll never let her down
I couldn’t bear to hear the sound of her steps leaving
And in the evening when the sun is running low
I’ll walk bravely through the fields of burning ember
And I’ll remember everything she said to me back when our love was first in bloom
But if I could find more that’s worthy
I’d surrender it all
All the praise that I could earn means nothing without hers
Not sure that I deserve the love that I recеive
But I give it all to her

But It Sure Ain’t Tennessee
And My Roots Down There In Georgia
Yeah They Started Missing Me
And I Wouldn’t Trade The Things I’ve Done
Or The Places That I’ve Been
But Man It Feels To Be Country Again
Traded In My Silverado
Didn’t Need No 4x4
Tucked My Boots In The Back Of My Closet
They Didn’t Feel Like Me No More
But I Dug Em Out And Slipped Em On
They Been On My Feet Since Then
Man It Feels Good To Be Country Again
Oooo Oooo Oooo
Oooo Oooo Oooo
Yeah I Love Me Some California
But It Sure Ain’t Tennessee
And My Roots Down There In Georgia
Yeah They Started Missing Me
And I Wouldn’t Change The Things I’ve Done
Or The Places That I’ve Been
But Man It Feels To Be Country Again
I Traded Sunsets With My Wife
For Hours On My Phone
And Even When I Was Right Beside Her
I Still Wasn’t Really Home
But Last Night We Built A Fire
I Watched The Moonlight Kiss Her Skin
And Thought Man It Feels Good To Be Country Again
Man It Feels Good To Be Country ..........Again
Yeah I Saw The Light
I Found My Way Home
Oh Thank You Lord Amen
Man It Feels Good To Be Country Again

They can drink as much as me and they can smoke me half to hell
And by the end of these songs when we bring our asses home
They'll all be thankin' God that they're not in this pain alone
And this world has been so cruel to me and it's been the same to them
But I don't mind sharin' my sweet depression
With some boys that act just like me and a girl that does the same
I don't know how I got here but I'm glad as hell I came
Come as you are, however broken
And we will see if we can make you whole again
Come as you are, with your heart wide open
Bridges that you've burned they are still there just floatin'
Remember us in our bright eyed days too young to go inside
Sittin' drunk on curbs tryin' to get us ourselves a rise
Of the pretty girls who walk down there on Elgin Avenue
Oklahoma sure is quiet but it has itself a view
And how am I supposed to know the good times that I'm in
If the good is only seen when I'm lookin' back at them
The boys are gettin' off work and they're haulin' on home
If I am meant for anything it's to show you you're not alone
Come as you are, however broken
And we will see if we can make you whole again
Come as you are, with your heart wide open

Whistling my name
Open up a beer
And you say get over here
And play a video game
I'm in his favorite sun dress
Watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown
I say you the bestest
Lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite perfume on
Go play a video game

Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do

They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby now you do
Singing in the old bars
Swinging with the old stars
Living for the fame
Kissing in the blue dark
Playing pool and wild darts
Video games
He holds me in his big arms
Drunk and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of
Watching all our friends fall
In and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playing video games

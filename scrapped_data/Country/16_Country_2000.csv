Won’t ya tell me something, that I don’t know
Oh and man I’m sunk, red faced and drunk
But there’s a reason I stayed up all night and begged you not to go
And here I fear we've found ourselves a sticky situation
It's an awkward occupation disregarding right from wrong
And you were down on Washington, dancing like the devil
Oh and I am just a fool, but I have loved you all along
Well the everyday, it gets in the way
Of all the things, that we could be
Don’t ya understand, well I’m an honest man
But I would steal you in a heartbeat if the choice were up to me
And here I fear we've found ourselves a sticky situation
It's an awkward occupation disregarding right from wrong
And you were down on Washington, dancing like the devil
Oh and I am just a fool, but I have loved you all along
Well what happens little baby when I blow this town and ain’t nobody like you
Got a brand new high and lonesome, it’s a bad dream comin’ true
Oh what’s a poor boy to do
And here I fear we've found ourselves a sticky situation
It's an awkward occupation disregarding right from wrong
And you were down on Washington, dancing like the devil
Oh and I am just a fool, but I have loved you all along
Yea well I am just a fool, but I have loved you all along

You come for me in the worst of places
You come for me, you come and try to take me home
I'm always in need, and it's hard to be reciprocating
The fabric of our life gets torn
And everything's changing, so how am I to know
How I'm going to hold on to you when I'm spinning out of control
You and I together, but only one of us in love
He says a name, it echoes in my head like it was a canyon
He says a name, he says it and I know what's up
You come to me sometimes when I'm thinking like a cannonball shooting out a cannon
And I forget whatever it was I was thinking about
And everything's changing, so how am I to know
How I'm going to hold on to you when I'm spinning out of control
You and I together, but only one of us in love

Moved into houses
In the same ZIP codes where their parents live

No I, I could never follow
I hit the highway
In a pink RV with stars on the ceiling
Lived like a gypsy
Six strong hands on the steering wheel
I've been a long time gone now
Maybe someday, someday I'm gonna settle down
But I've always found my way somehow
By taking the long way
Taking the long way around
Taking the long way
Taking the long way around
I met the queen of whatever
Drank with the Irish and smoked with the hippies
Moved with the shakers
Wouldn't kiss all the asses that they told me to
No I, I could never follow
No I, I could never follow

Since the top of the world came crashing down
And I'm gettin' it back on the road now

Would you lay me down beside   you
Tell me everything I want to hear

We search for someone else to blame
But sometimes things can't stay the same

Would you lay me down beside   you

Got a little left
One little drop of falling rain
One little chance to try again
One little bird that makes it home

One little piece of endless sky
One little taste of cherry pie
One little week in paradise

We'd walk to church on Sunday morn
and race barefoot back to Johnson's Fence

  that summer I turned a corner in my soul
down that red dirt road
It's where I drank my first beer
  It's where I found Jesus
  Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
  I learned the path to heaven
  It's full of sinners and believers
  Learned that happiness on earth

There's life at both ends 
  Of that red dirt road

In my shackled up GTO
I'd sneak out in the middle of the night
Throw rocks at her bedroom window
  We'd turn out the headlights
  Drive by the moonlight
  Talk about what the future might hold
Down that red dirt road
It's where I drank my first beer
  It's where I found Jesus
  Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces

What our ghosts will say
We gave the world what it saw fit
And what'd we get?

He could not sleep for restlessness, downtown he went

We drank and we threw up sometimes we practiced and played
Our drummer couldn't figure out whether he was straight or he was gay
We went on tour within walking distance of our house
Maybe that is why no one knew what our sound was all about
Thats why I say gather around you people now

'til they bury me down beneath the ground with the dust and rattlin' bones
Left my home and left my love caught on a rusty nail
Devil rose up heavy with gold my soul's not for sale
then a holy man in a house of God he offered me a book of prayer
but when I Left my home and left my love I left my  faith back there
Smoke don't rise fuel don't burn sun don't shine no more
Late one night sorrow come 'round scratching at my door
but I cut my hands and break my back draggin' this bag of stones
'til they bury me down beneath the ground with the dust and rattlin' bones
Shut my eyes and hang my head darkness makes no sound
Climbin' up a bottleneck hurts on the way back down
when a sadness falls on the morning bird wonder what the day will bring
but I shut my eyes and hang my head at least that bird can sing
Smoke don't rise fuel don't burn sun don't shine no more
Late one night sorrow come 'round scratching at my door
but I cut my hands and break my back draggin' this bag of stones
'til they bury me down beneath the ground with the dust and rattlin' bones

 And that girl I liked, we kept on tryin till we got it right
 And that was 1976, didn't know who I was yet
 A pretty little blonde haired girl stole my heart and changed my world
 Two kids and a moonlit sky, a little love on a Friday night
 Built a fire that just wont quit, that was 1976 
 Yeah, that was 1976, didn't know who we were yet
 Built a fire that just wont quit and that was 1976
 We built a fire that just wont quit, that was 1976

46,Watch The Wind Blow By,Tim McGraw,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tim-mcgraw/watch-the-wind-blow-by-chords-428076,"Creek goes rippling by
I've been barefoot and all day with my baby
Brown leaves have started falling
Leading the way
I like it best just like this
Doing nothing all the way
So let's lay down in the tall grass
Dreaming away
And all I wanna do is let it be and be with you
And watch the wind blow by
And all I wanna see is you and me go on forever
Like the clear blue sky
Slowly, there's only
You and I
And all I want to do is watch the wind blow by
Girl, you know you told me not so long ago
To let it come, then let it pass
And all your troubles and your sorrows
They won't last
So let me kiss you now, little darling
Beneath this autumn moon
Cold wind, another season
Will be here soon
And all I wanna do is let it be and be with you
And watch the wind blow by
And all I wanna see is you and me go on forever
Like the clear blue sky
Slowly, there's only
You and I
And all I want to do is watch the wind blow by
And all I want to do is watch the wind blow by
And all I want to do is watch the wind blow by

And it sure feels good, to finally feel the way I do. I wanna love somebody, 
love somebody like you
And I'm letting go of all my lonely yesterdays, I've forgiven myself for the 
mistakes I've made
Now there's just one thing, the only thing I wanna do. I wanna love 
somebody, love somebody like you
Yeah I wanna feel the sunshine, shining down on me and you
When you put your arms around me, you let me know there's nothing in the 
world I can't do
I used to run in circles going, nowhere fast, I'd take one step forward end 
up two steps back 
I couldn't walk a straight line, even if I wanted to
I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you (Woh here we go now...)
Yeah I wanna feel the sunshine, shining down on me and you
When you put your arms around me, you let me know there's nothing in the 
world I can't do
Sometimes it’s hard for me, to understand, but you're teaching me to be a 
better man 
I don't want to take this life for granted like I used to do
I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you
I'm ready to love somebody, love somebody like you
And I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you

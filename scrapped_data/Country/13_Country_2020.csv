0,Always Gonna Love You,Florida Georgia Line,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/florida-georgia-line/always-gonna-love-you-chords-3562067,"Like my mama's home cooking after Sunday church
Like an ice cold beer after hard work
Like a hot cup of coffee on your way to town
Like an underdog last second touchdown
Like the feeling that you get when you get a bite
Like the power of a throttle when it's open wide
When the sand runs out of that hourglass
You ain't ever gotta wonder, you ain't gotta ask
I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you
Always gonna love you, baby
I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you
Always gonna love you
When the sun burns out and the cows come home
From now 'til forever something you can count on is
I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you
Always gonna love you, baby
Love them freckles that you get in the summertime
And the way you get giddy off a glass of wine
Even the way you take forever and you never on time
Ain't a thing not to love, ain't no wonder why, baby
I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you
Always gonna love you, baby
I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you
Always gonna love you
When the sun burns out and the cows come home
From now 'til forever something you can count on is
I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you
Always gonna love you, baby
I'm always gonna love you, yeah, yeah
I'm always gonna love you, oh, yes I am
If you ever second guess (I, I, I, I)
Baby, just remember this and don't you ever forget
I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you
Always gonna love you, baby
I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you
Always gonna love you
When the sun burns out and the cows come home
From now 'til forever something you can count on is
I, I, I, I, I, I'm always gonna love you
Always gonna love you, baby

North of old Montan'
The livings fine, when the springtime's kind
To a bovine raising man
Where they sort 'em, and stretch 'em, and tail 'em down
Like they did in days gone by
And good slab fence, and common sense
Are ne'er in short supply
Where the iron still hits the fire
And the rope's thrown straight and true
And they scorch their hides, till upon their sides
The brand is showing through
And the spring time turns with the coulee's curve
And it's summer once again
Whoopi ti yi yo, at the rodeo
And we pray our buddies win
It's Western swing and waltzes
Like to wear out your boots
It's horsehair floors, and Louis L'Amour
After they close the chutes
When they've rode up all the rank ones
And the chucks are out of sight
It's Western swing and waltzes'

And so far in my life, I'll agree
But it seems a lot more comfortable to cry in a Lamborghini
But one day while you're driving down the 5
The earth splits open and all of us die
At least we're all together and this time it's forever
And all we have to pass the time
Is you, and them, and me and the reckoning!
You might get to sleep forever in a 24 karat casket
Covered up in dirt from a place you can't pronounce
Headstone so big evеn astronauts can see
The only thing you'll never gеt to die with is dignity
Most of life we're sitting on a bench
And we know the bird above us is gonna, you know
Well some days we move and others we just yell (Just go ahead, everyone else does)
I think I'd rather have bad luck than have no luck at all
I'd rather be alive than half a dozen feet below
And things will never go back to the way they were before
Because I don't think this world wants us on it anymore
I don't think this world wants us on it anymore
And subtlety isn't everyone's cup of tea
Some of us prefer a little whiskey
But it's your life, you're the only one that has to lose it
And we might never get to see inside a 24 karat casket
Hopefully we had a damn good life while we had it
Headstone so small no one will ever read
But hopefully if we're lucky we'll die with dignity

As long as i catch a buzz and tan
Just a couple cheap and foldup seats

And a cold can
 Im tired of wasting my time
On traffic jams and boss mans and chasing a dime

 A little more Otis Redding red wine sipping
 A little less 5 AM
 A little more sleeping in
 A little more take it slow backroad drive

And my mother hit the bar

49,The Old Rugged Cross,Carrie Underwood,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/carrie-underwood/the-old-rugged-cross-chords-3798350,"On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
the emblem of suffering and shame.
And I love that old cross where the dearest and best
for a world of lost sinners was slain.
So, I'll cherish the old rugged cross
'til my trophies at last I lay down.
I will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown.
In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
a wondrous beauty I see.
For it was on that old cross Jesus suffered and died
to pardon and sanctify me.
So, I'll cherish the old rugged cross
'til my trophies at last I lay down.
I will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown.
Yes, I'll cherish the old rugged cross
'til my trophies at last I lay down.
I will cling to the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day for a crown.
Yes, I'll cherish the old rugged cross
and exchange it some day   for a crown.

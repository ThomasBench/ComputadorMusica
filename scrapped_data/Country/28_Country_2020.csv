It ain't the new year, February 14th
The sane me said I'm sorry, I ain't done nothin' wrong
Baby, you're always just on the tip of my tongue
I don't need no reason to dance you 'round this floor
No special occasion to tell you I love you more
Than a man's ever loved any woman
Girl, I feel it 365
If you're really askin', baby, you're the why
I  don't  need no reason
To cancel my mornin' and stay in bed with you
To pick your flowers straight through the afternoon
Pick up my old guitar and play a brand new melody
Write a lyric down for you
Baby, can't you see? (Can't you see?)
I don't need no reason to dance you 'round this floor
No special occasion to tell you I love you more

Cause there's nothing as hard as telling someone a lie, straight from the heart

There was no escapin' from what we had found
But I still believe in another goodbye
The one without questions and reasons why
Ooh I still believe, yeah, I still believe
I still feel you lead me, through my darkest of days
When all of my brightness has turned into ashes, and has blown away

There was no escapin' from what we had found

Now every single match will get a turn
First the smoke, then a flame appears
I can feel the fire drawing me in
Smoke is filling up my room
As I write another love letter to you
Just for you
See the sun is sinking low
You're going but you got nowhere to go
Walk the streets, you're nowhere bound
Like the king of the underground
Now you're calling me your friend
Setting me free to chase the wind
Chase the wind
Fire that keeps me, keeps me
Fire that keeps me, keeps me running
Running
Fire that keeps me, keeps me
Fire that keeps me, keeps me running
Running
Sun is sinking, now it's gone
But it's coming back before too long
I'll hit the pavement, walk it out
Telling me what it's all about
And all my friends out at the show
I'm going but I've got nowhere to go
To go
Fire looking back at me
Fire tell me what you see
Tell me how you burn so bright
Keeping me company tonight
Yes I'm calling you my friend
But every fire needs the wind
Chase the wind

We take time to stop, just to feel the wind blow
Where I come from we grow sweet corn and tobacco
And everybody waves back at you when you pass 'em
Girl, you take me back to that road
Like the sound of a magnolia breeze
Ice cubes in sweet tea
Fight song on a Friday, bug zapper buzzin' in the driveway
It ain't much, but it sounds so sweet
A southern symphony
To sing along, let it play on and on
'Cause where I come from, that's a love song,
It's the sound of a magnolia breeze
Ice cubes in sweet tea
Fight song on a Friday, bug zapper buzzin' in the driveway
It's the sound of Hymn 112
Stories my Grandpa tells
Garth Brooks on a CD
And Rocky Top on TV
It ain't much, but it sounds so sweet
A southern symphony
Sing along, but we don't need a record on,
No, no. Just let it play on and on
'Cause where I come from, that's a love song
Where I  come from that's a love sooong...

Variating slightly

Mark me 'return to sender'

Marigold print on her dress
Her hair was combed and parted
Like a beautiful princess
I didn't see you at the altar
Way back then you were so drunk
You were washed up on some hooker's bed
Behind a shitty restaurants
Bought her pretty clothes and diamonds
The guy was born to be her man
We were more than commentary
For a cheap headline grab
So when the wind blows in your window
'Cause the storm don't give a damn
Pray the window don't break
Across the wrist of your writing hand
On a stationary wept with tears
Of the peoples backs you stab
When you're hiding like a robber
With no one's purse to grab
Remember me standing there holding out my hand

We put the corn in the field for the barbeque
We fed the pig for the skin
For the touchdown win at the high school

Clutch pearls and buckets of ice
Dyed cotton candy, blonde lady does the honours
Introducing all the family who fights
And the sunlight of late afternoon
Leans across the altar till it slaps the groom
The flowers we gathered in ribbons of blue
Clutched tight to her chest in her room
And the band played Christ Is Risen Today
While everybody waits
'Cause nobody knows who they really are
To the stranded in Coronado trashed at the bar
Till the wind carries all of the things you love most
Long loose strings tangled in the trees
Woman, your silence brought me to my knees
Where I needed to be
Your hair smells of lilac, roses and cinnamon
And waves moving slow across the rocks
Humid and heavy, clouds of salt water
Rusted the hands off the clocks
And I smoke cigarettes in the heat
Watching Flamingos from the hotel balcony
My head was on fire and the bartenders knew
Written on the wall, in cursive, ""We're through.""
And the band played The Safety Dance as I cried
In the taxi alone
'Cause nobody knows that they are the fool
Stranded in Coronado, drunk at the pool
'Till the drinks carries off the burden at cost
To let go of things you already lost
Woman, your silence brought me to my knees
Where I needed to be
Woman, your silence brought me to my knees
Where I needed to be
The highway was empty, we speeded on safely
Tears falling onto your dress
The ring on your finger disappeared slowly
You let go already's my guess
You cried as we made our way home
Said you didn't wanna leave
But I could tell by the things that your ma and your pa didn’t do
Like look me in the eye as we said goodbye
And the band says Wednesday's my right hand
As I pray for you at night
'Cause nobody knows what they really want
Till the car's full of boxes and you watch it drive off
The cocaine and pills and the drinks, they wear off
And the cigarettes, they just make you cough
Oh, woman, your love brought me to my knees
Where I needed to be
The house is so quiet
I hear the leaves fall from the lemon trees where
There's now too much room for this house made for two
Your side of the closet's so bare
I still hear the sound of your voice
Calling my name like some midnight train
Rumbling heart full of ghosts
Of everyone that I loved, I miss you the most
And the plans we made fade like the sun on the coast
'Cause nobody knows what they really need
Till it's too late with reason to wait
You wake up insane, screaming her name
But there's no one to blame now but me
Oh, woman, your silence brought me to my knees

The pictures on the wall, your eyes a history of kindness
Would've married you right then if you had asked
My life is just a tunnel to another tomb
Just like that, boom, that time had passed
And who

Used to sleep beside the angel, now I'm just a stranger

On Windover Lane by the window of your room
Your long brown locks fall across your face
Your memory comes crashing down 'til all my bones break
I call out your name, it echoes in the room
I sleep on the couch, a bed will not do
And I don't wanna let go, take me back to the start
I will love you while we are learning to walk in the dark
I write your name in every color, a flower was made
And bury my face in your memory of all my mistakes
In the doorway on streets where you used to stand
And kiss me goodbye, you would hold out your hand
It's starting to rain on Broadway and Canal
While the radiator rumbles and the rain's coming down
I don't wanna let go, take me back to the start
I will love you while we are learning to walk in the dark
Your fingers still slide from my wrist to my hand
On our way to the station in the rain while the traffic's all jammed
Now there's nothing to say, not even ""goodnight""
I just scribble your name in tears in the book of my life
You will always be saved some place behind my eyes
Where it's always summer and we laugh in the summertime
I don't wanna let go, take me back to the start
I will love you while we are learning to walk in the dark

Who leaves the money in the mattress
Sheets silver and gold
Like all the money in the world
could help you sleep
When it don't matter anymore
  And where you lay your head
Is anybody's guess these days
Our love is a maze
Only one of us was meant to escape
And I was lost before I felt your love
So, anyways
I do not understand goodbye
I take the memories that it stole
I put it in the resin in the tombs
inside my soul
I do not understand or trust
Nobody anymore
Words crumble into dust
I sit and write your name
Like it was a map for me back to us
   But where you lay your head
Is anybody's guess these days
   Our love is a maze
Only one of us was meant to escape
  And where you lay your head
Is on the shoulder of who's left in the game
  Our love is a maze
Confused by all these numbers and names
Without the poison,
there was no one left to say
""So, anyways""

Why did you let it go?
To throw it all away
As she lets go
She lets go
Hands separate
Lost in time

Let it be some day where all the moments passed
No one is the winner, no one comes in last
Or comes close to even mattering
Why did you want to throw it all away?
Why did you let it go?
To throw it all away
As she lets go
She lets go
She lets go

Lost in time
In the corner I'm the clown
Newspaper open as he smokes
Our love's a monster as it crawls
Abandoning the car
Nothing in this place makes sense
Words, no evidence a history of plain
But you did everything I did
So you could paint your face on mine
Why did you want to throw it all away?
Why did you let it go?

Where the eagle cries to the wind
'Neath a moss covered stone
Lies a box full of bones
And a ring engraved 'Janie Lynn'
My horse was needin' shoes my throat was needin' booze
After six long days down in the mine
That Appaloosa roan many nights had brought me home
After nippin' on the whiskey or the wine
The bar at Fifth and Pearl had a brand new dancin' girl
And I tossed a shiny dollar at her feet
She took it with a grin said ""My name is Janie Lynn
If you're buyin' whiskеy then I'll drink it neat""
And I said good to know you Janie darlin'
I'vе never seen a woman look so fine
I'd gladly rob and kill from here to Johnsonville
Just to win ten minutes of your time
Well I hit the bottle hard and somewhere after dark
I heard Janie yellin' in the street
That Yankee Bill Sinclair had grabbed her by the hair
And I was watchin' as he knocked her off her feet
Well I drew a wicked knife and I took the old man's life
Before I even knew what I had done
I whistled for my roan but the traitor trotted home
And there I was too drunk to even run
I just said are you ok Janie darlin'?
Have you ever seen a brighter moon?
This may be the last time I get to see it shine
If only I had just walked home with you
Now Janie makes me pray when she visits twice a day
For tomorrow is the day that I will swing
When no-one was around and her tears were fallin' down
She handed me her pretty golden ring
And I said no more weepin' for me Janie
There's no turning back the hands of time
And anyway it's true that ten minutes with you
Was better than a lifetime in the mine
High on a bluff of the Arkansas river
Where the eagle cries to the wind
'Neath a moss covered stone
Lies a box full of bones
And a ring engraved 'Janie Lynn'

0,You Dont Know Me,Alison Krauss,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/alison-krauss/you-dont-know-me-chords-2406545,"You give your hand to me and then you say hello,
And I can hardly speak my heart is beating so,
And anyone could tell, you think you know me well,
But you don't know me....
No you don't know the one who dreams of you at night,
And longs to kiss your lips, and whom to hold you tight,
To you I'm just a friend, that's all I've ever been,
But you don't know me.
For I never knew, the art of making love,
Though my heart aches with love for you,
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by,
The chance, that you might have loved me too.
You give your hand to me and then you say goodbye,
You watched me walk away beside my lucky guy,
To never, never know, the one who loves you so,
No you don't know me.

You watched me walk away beside my lucky guy,
To never, never know, the one who loves you so,
No you don't know me.

she was poppin' right out of the south Georgia water
I thought ""Oh Good Lord, she has them long tanned legs""
Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said.
Baby, you a song.  You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise.
Down a backroad, blowin' stop signs through the middle
every litte farm town with you.
This brand new Chevy with a lift kit,
would look a helluvalot better with you up in it.
Baby, you a song.  You make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise.
She was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were fallin' in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
""Fire it up, let's go get thing stuck!""

When that summer sun fell to it's knees I looked at her and she looked at me
And I turned on those KC lights and drove all night cause it felt so right
Hurry now don't it feel so right.
I put it in park and grabbed my guitar and
strummed a couple chords and sang from the heart.
Girl you know you got the beat in my chest pumpin'
Hell I can't get you outta my head.

And it's crazy to think that one little thing 
Could have changed all of this
Maybe it didn't turn out like I planned
Maybe that's why I'm such, such a lucky man

Who said she could do better
Or the college I wanted to go to
Till I got that letter
All the fights and the tears and the heartache
I thought I'd never get through
And the moment I almost gave up
All led me here to you
I didn't understand it way back when
But sittin' here right now
It all makes perfect sense

Lord only knows what she means to me, solid as the rock on her left hand
She's proud to be my woman
That's why I'm proud to be her man
She's flowers in her hair on Sunday morning and she's a Bud Light in her hand on Friday night
She's cornbread in the oven, she's wild and crazy loving me just right - Oh you know that's right
She ain't afraid to put me in my place
She ain't afraid to love me every night so every day

Some are dead and buried, some are never found

Cracked windshield light - will you be the death of me?

I was all the colors of the little river town
And the drums of the masses were like a funeral band

I just wanna fall in line --
And do my time, and be something
Well I just wanna prove my worth --
On the planet Earth, and be, something
I just wanna fall in love
Not fuck it up, and feel something
Well lately, don’t understand what I am
Treated as a fool
Not quite a woman or a man
Well I don’t know
I guess I don’t understand the plan
Colonized, and hypnotized, be something
Sterilized, dehumanized, be something
Well take your pay
And stay out the way, be something
Ah do your best
But fuck the rest, be something
Well lately, it’s been mighty hard to see
Just searching for my lost humanity
I look for you, my friend
But do you look for me?
Lately I’m not too afraid to die
I wanna leave it all behind
I think about it sometimes
Lately all my time’s been movin slow
I don’t know where I’m gonna go
Just give me time, I’ll know
Oh, any day now
Oh, any day now
I will come along
Oh, any day now
Oh, any day now
I will come along
I will come along
From el barrio to Arecibo, ¡Pa’lante!
From Marble Hill to the ghost of Emmett Till, ¡Pa’lante!
To Juan, Miguel, Milagros, Manuel, ¡Pa’lante!
To all who came before, we say, ¡Pa’lante!
To my mother and my father, I say, ¡Pa’lante!
To Julia, and Sylvia, ¡Pa’lante!
To all who had to hide, I say, ¡Pa’lante!
To all who lost their pride, I say, ¡Pa’lante!
To all who had to survive, I say, ¡Pa’lante!
To my brothers, and my sisters, I say, ¡Pa’lante!

How there is no holding back
No point in wasting sorrow
On things that won’t be here tomorrow
But you and I, well we don’t need to speak
It’s a secret that we keep
Out of view and out of sight
 Just say when and we‘ll say goodnight
 Tell me it’s oka-----y
To live life this wa-----y
Sometimes I want you to stay
I know it’s a shame
 Shame
 Shame
Now I've spend so much of my time
Going out of my mind
Trying so hard to be of use 
 But what you cannot gain you lose
In LA, the sun’s almost too bright
I cannot get it right
The emptiness I feel
 And now none of it seems real
So maybe it’s alri----ght
If I just spend the ni----ght
Sometimes I just can’t bear to walk away
I know it’s a shame
 Shame
 Shame
 Who have I become?
 Who will I beeeee?
Come tomorrow
Tell me it’s oka-----y
If I ask you to sta-----y
Sometimes the night cuts through me like a knife
I know it’s a shame
I know it's a shame
I know it's a shame
 Sha--me
 Sha--me

41,Miss You So Much,Miley Cyrus,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/miley-cyrus/miss-you-so-much-chords-2172273,"The last chord in every verse, should be strummed once
They say love can drive you crazy, my dear
I wanna trap you in a locket, or in my pocket
So I can keep you near
You know I'd never hurt you
If you fall, I'd pick you up and I'd drink your tears
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?
They say good things come to those who wait
It's like countin' in light years
I'd physically live without you, but I don't want to
And death's never been my fear
You can take my blood, take my bones
My heart is yours, I volunteer
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?
When you look up at a rainbow
Do you ever wonder what's really waiting at the end?
I don't want no gold, nothing's more than you
The amount is hard to even comprehend
Nothing I can do, I lost control
Something we hold on to so dear
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?
And how at this optimal time did you just appear?
Everyone under their guard is so full of shit
But you are just so sheer
You're my God, you're my faith
On my knees, I look at you and I revere
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?
When you look up at the cosmos
Do you ever wonder if there's really even an end?
It might go on forever, like my love for you
An amount that's hard to even comprehend
I won't waste my time with wonder, in apprehension, or livin' life in fear
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?
You're my God, you're my faith
On my knees, I look at you and I revere
You can take my blood, take my bones
My heart is yours, I volunteer
But how can I miss you so much when you're right here?

43,Can I Get An Outlaw,Luke Combs,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/luke-combs/can-i-get-an-outlaw-chords-1954309,"Back in the day it was a six gun, and a six string
Man, that was country
And that's the way country still out to be
It was lived, not taught, it was earned not bought
Had to put in the work to get to the top
Let me tell you, what I thinks really gone wrong
These days its all wannabes singing someone else's songs
Everybody's doing the same damn thing
Where have the rebels gone?
Cause we don't need
Another pretty boy, singing pretty songs
Fake country boys, doing country all wrong
We need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewing tobacco, and whipping ass
I need preacher, I need a savior
How about y'all?
Can I get an outlaw?
It don't have to be honkytonks, boots, and wrangler jeans
It ain't the banjo or the fiddle, no
It's the words and what they mean
If you gonna talk the talk, you better walk the walk
And brother that's the truth
So honestly, what would Waylon do?
I can guarantee that if he was alive today
He'd ask us one more time:
""Are you sure Hank done it this way?""
Cause we don't need
Another pretty boy, singing pretty songs
Fake country boys, doing country all wrong
We need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewing tobacco, and whipping ass
I need preacher, I need a savior
How about y'all?
Can I get an outlaw?
Are the good times really gone for good?
Or did we get back to our roots?
It's about that time we raise the bar
So raise a glass if you feel like I do
Cause we don't need
Another pretty boy, singing pretty songs
Fake country boys, doing country all wrong
We need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewing tobacco, and whipping ass
I need preacher, I need a savior
How about y'all?
I pray country answers my call
Oh, can I get an outlaw?

Can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire
I got a woman with eyes that shine
Down deep as a diamond mine
She's my treasure so very rare
She made me a millionaire
When we ride around, ride around this old town.
In the beat-up car, with my windows down
People look at her and they look at me
Saying ""That boy's sure living in luxury""
Sweet luxury
Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought never could be sold
I got love enough to share
That makes me a millionaire
When the kisses fall from everywhere
Life reaches on, millionaire
When the pocket's are empty and the cupboard is bare
I still feel like a millionaire
Cause love is more precious than gold
It can't be bought and it can't be sold
I got love enough to spare
That makes me a millionaire

Seen a big Montana sky
Driven up and down the coast a few times
London, Paris, paradise

No matter what we do

Know there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you

You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea
And the night rolled in
And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall

No matter what we do

And people counting down everywhere

Cause baby you were there
And once again
Couldn't help but stare

Heaven ain't goin' nowhere
Perilous crossing to the other side
I reckon heaven ain't goin' nowhere

Heaven ain't goin' nowhere
Glory and my hard road to travel, I'm told
Heaven ain't goin' nowhere
Back bent double by a ponderous load
I reckon heaven ain't goin' nowhere

Heaven ain't goin' nowhere
I work all day so I sleep alright
Heaven ain't goin' nowhere
I raise a little hell on a Saturday night

Lightning through the window

Midnight's slowin' us down
All I can think with your hands on my hips
The taste of your drink when you're kissin' my lips is
Don't ever wanna stop
Don't wanna watch the clock
Let's keep it goin', goin'
I kinda hope the clouds roll in
Rain slippin' through the window screen
 I kinda hope the thunder comes and keeps us up
So we can't sleep
'Cause layin' here tangled up in these sheets
Is sweeter than anything I could dream
Don't wanna shut my eyes
Wanna stay up all night, together
I'm countin' on the weather
I'm countin' on the weather
It'll be so worth it
Even if the mornin'
Sun's burnin' in our eyes
We'll just close the curtains
Forget any work and
Later we'll apologize
Let's drink up this moment with all that we've got
Pretend that it's stormin' even if it's not

Don't wanna watch the clock

working hard at nothing

So I consider it a full time job having my fun
Sure somedays this smokestack gets to puffing
But most my days I’m overworked

Nothing, I’m watching the birds and learning how to fly
I used to get in trouble for all the things I done but that old race is run
So come down now the leaves are rustling I got a little time for nothing
A cold beer ain’t worth a damn lest it’s sweating in your hand
So hand me down another friend let's make a plan
The day may come we'll get back to hustling
But till that day let's make our hay
making bets on nothing

Pale light through the break
Like Crooked Teeth
You saw me falter
knowin what was at stake
Nothin of underneath
And the Hills move like lungs
The river speaks in Tounges
And I am not alone
Naked Shenandoah
shakin me down
Her banks lined with foam
I saw you trembling
all wrapped up in a towel
Afraid to go home.
And the sky frozen black
Covered my wayward tracks
As I left to get stoned
A sap of recollection
Bleeds through the grain
and hardens the soil
Flights of temporal affection
Poison the vein
Loosen the coils
And if I could find a use
for things I cannot help but do
I might one day atone.
Come on down from your mountain
I’m gonna kick in my own door
Gain my native sight
Shed these worries unfounded
I’ll leave em there on the floor
In the blue television light
And the wolves are closing in
Blood runs cold and thin
Moon shines bright as bones.
And the Hills move like lungs
The rivers speak in Tounges
And I am not alone

You've got the wrong girl
If you think I don't know what I'm worth you're living in the wrong world
I'm better than that I know what I deserve
And if you think that you're gonna
Come get what you want
Whenever you want and be gone
You've got the wrong girl
You've got the wrong girl
You've got the wrong girl

47,Body Language Of A Breakup,Lindsay Ell,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lindsay-ell/body-language-of-a-breakup-chords-3295835,"     I'll bet you five bucks
He said something that he can't take back
She's been holding
It in for months but
She's about to crack
You see the way she
Leans away she
Just put her hands in her coat
 And oh-oh-oh-oh
He keeps on trying
She rolls her eyes and
 Looks down at her phone
Love is so funny
You can always call it
Standing from a mile away
But when you're in the middle
S'like you can't see, can't read it
Written all over your face
   Nobody wants to hurt nobody
   So we hang on just enough
 He thinks she'll forgive him
  She thinks that they're gonna kiss and makeup
 But that's the body language of a breakup
The body language of a breakup
My friends could see it
My momma warned me
But I stayed on that fence
 And I act like genius now
Got it all figured out
But flip that mirror around
I lose all common sense
Love is so funny
You can always call it
Standing from a mile away
But when you're in the middle
S'like you can't see, can't read it
Written all over your face
   Nobody wants to hurt nobody
   So we hang on just enough
 He thinks she'll forgive him
  She thinks that they're gonna kiss and makeup
 But that's the body language of a breakup
The body language of a breakup
You see the way she
Looks up at him she
Knows that there's still a spark
Oh-oh-oh-oh
She even knows she'll
Be letting go of
A little piece of her heart
Love is so funny
You can always call it
Standing from a mile away
But when you're in the middle
S'like you can't see, can't read it
Written all over your face
   Nobody wants to hurt nobody
   So we hang on just enough
 He thinks she'll forgive him
  She thinks that they're gonna kiss and makeup
 But that's the body language of a breakup
The body language of a breakup

48,Go To,Lindsay Ell,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lindsay-ell/go-to-chords-3295877,"I don't wanna be a vodka soda on a Friday night
I don't wanna be a ""hey you"" through a cell phone every once in a while
I don't wanna be a movie that you see, one time and forget
I don't wanna be that girl, and that's it
I wanna go to your head, go to your heart, go to where ain't nobody
Gone to before, dance in the dark, don't stop after the party
Get in your truck, boy, hang up the phone
Get on the road ‘cause I gotta hold you
Hell, I would tell you but you already know
I'm the heaven that you wanna go to
I wanna be your blue jeans that get better as they get old
I wanna be the last stretch of the black top back home
All I wanna be is everything you need, every day and night
For the rest of your life
I wanna go to your head, go to your heart, go to where ain't nobody
Gone to before, dance in the dark, don't stop after the party
Get in your truck, boy, hang up the phone
Get on the road ‘cause I gotta hold you
Hell, I would tell you but you already know
I'm the heaven that you wanna go to
I don't wanna be a movie that you see, one time and forget
I don't wanna be that girl, and that's it
I wanna go to your head, go to your heart, go to where ain't nobody
Gone to before, dance in the dark, don't stop after the party
Get in your truck, boy, hang up the phone
Get on the road ‘cause I gotta hold you
Hell, I would tell you but you already know
I'm the heaven that you wanna go to,  go to
You already know, boy, yeah
That you wanna go to

  In my bedroom I can?t sleep 
  And all my friends got crooked tales
That?s the way I like it, that's just what I need and

That?s the way I like it, that's the company I keep
There we are, we're standing in the shooting stars
  In our houses, ashes, the bars
  you didn?t know it, now you do
this happens to be the way,   we move
In the belly of the whale, 
  in the belly of the beast
  At the last supper honey, 
Make sure you get something, something to eat
Here we are standing in the shooting stars
  In our houses,  in our cars
  you didn?t know it, now you do

I was standing by the river watching my bridge burn down
Cause I done a bad thing and I'm paying it for all right now
Oh I've done a bad thing and I'm paying it for all right now
Hey there doctor, tell me what do you see?
Cause I got a bad disease and need of your remedy
And I've been aching from my head to my toes
I've been aching so much that I just don't ache no more
But there is a one thing that I need you to see
And you ain't never met a man sick as me
Hey mister bartender you see my tremblin' hands
You know I need a drink and I need it so bad
Cause I don't know...Lordy what I just done
But you got me burning like a foxchild rebel under the sun
And now I'm shaking from all my misery
Cause you ain't never met a man as wrong as me
And no, no, no, I don't lie
Cause I was taken over by the devil last night
And I know, know, know, when he come around
I've done a bad thing and I'm paying for it all right now
Hey mister Judge, you gonna lock me up
Cause I've been thinking things that I should not thinkin' of
Go and hide all your brothers, go and hide the knife (night?)
You got me creepin' though the dark in the middle of the lonely night
You'd better lock your door, n' throw away the key
Cause you ain't never met a man as guilty as me

Two hours later I’m back in my neighborhood where everything just stopped
It still looks the same they remember my name stepping in for a cupful
There’s a big city man I used to rumble with him back in high school
The slow cruel hands of time
Turn you into molten lava oh my
A place on the right you can stop for awhile, look out for the policeman
There’s no street lamps, only three buildings and one of them’s vacant
It’s taken all day, the pack’s feeling heavy and soon the night
Backwards down the mountain the axle is grinding pulling into the wrong drive
The sky is in the yard,
Stringy cotton candy is the fog
The slow climb, the hard fall
Sometime’s I don’t want it at all
I’ve done this so long, it’s something I ought to know
So long
Finally up, all the peace is disrupted and the birds fly
Trapped for a moment, the sheriff’s department got the wrong guy
The town’s revealed below
Visible wind through the fog
The slow cruel hands of time
Turning you back into a child

What the hell else can I do
I wanna slow it all down and watch it roll by
See where the sweet melody falls
I wanna roll off the tempo, lay back and get high
Cause it's only time and time after all
I've grown tired of cold places and the same old cold faces
and I'm tired of the smoke they all blow in my eyes
I'm sick of the banging, can't take no more clanging
I'm tired of yelling over top that back line
They say time takes care of itself
It gets by without no help at all

I took a walk to clear my head,
This is where the walking lead
Can't believe you're really gone
Don't feel like going home
So I'm gonna sit right here

Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

Too soon, but the good Lord knows
The reasons why, I guess
Sometimes the greater plan
Is kinda hard to understand
Right now it don't make sense
I can't make it all make sense
So I'm gonna sit right here

Watch the sunset disappear
And drink a beer

And I know your feeling like you just can’t win but your trying 
Its hard to keep on keepin on when your bein pushed around 
Don't even know which way is up, you just keep spinning down around and down 
Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away 
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain 
So hold your head up and tell yourself that theres something more and walk
out that door 
Go find a new rose, don’t be afraid of the thorns cause we all have thorns 
Just put your feet up to the edge put your face in the wind
And when you fall back down, keep on rememberin 
Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away 
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain 
It’s gonna run out of pain
It’s gonna run out of sting
It’s gonna leave you alone
It’s gonna set you free and set you free 
Every storm runs, runs out of rain
Just like every dark night turns into day
Every heartache will fade away 
Just like every storm runs, runs out of rain

Anything they can do, they clamor for me

Nobody trying to explain

Resting my head, in some moss covered glen

Now tan from the rust and the dirt

Remember when We couldn't take the heat

    Picked you out and picked you up
    Hoping that my luck would change
     I let the summer fill my lungs
    And super-stition fill my brain

A million little wishes blow
A-cross the sky
But it's a waste of breath and
It's a waste of time, I know
   'Cause just like him
You always leave me cryin'
Dande lion
    Sent you dancing on the breeze
    And like a stupid little girl
    I spent my wishes on a weed
   Thinking it could change my world

A-cross the sky

It's a waste of time, I know

Have let me down so many times be-fore
And you're just one more

Oh dande-lion
Im always blowin kisses out

Between telling a joke and turning a knife
Don't wreck my reputation let me wreck my own

At this moment in the dream
That old man there in the mirror
And my shaky self-esteem
Here today and gone tomorrow
It's the way it's got to be
With an empty blue horizon
For as far as I can see
God Almighty here I am
Am I where I ought to be
I've begun to soon descend
Like the sun into the sea
And I thank my lucky stars
From here to eternity
For the artist that you are
And the man you made of me
Pretty speeches still unspoken
Perfect circles in the sand
Rules and promises I've broken
That I still don't understand
Soon or later I'll be leaving
I'm a winner either way
For the laughter and the loving
That I'm living with today
God Almighty here I am
Am I where I ought to be
I've begun to soon descend
Like the sun into the sea
And I thank my lucky stars
From here to eternity
For the artist that you are
And the man you made of me

They’re behind me now

that will not break down
like you never did
The kids say hello
to us in our separate homes
Darling please come home
I’ve cleaned out the fridge
Wiped the counters off
and put away my clothes
Do you remember every block
Every minute of every walk we used to take
We were young so many years ago
And I think of all this time
that we have wasted with all our fighting and I cry
Just want to die with the one I love beside me
someday you will miss my head
lying next to yours
in our marriage bed
Do you remember every block
Every minute of every walk we used to take
Oh God I love my vices but they’ve taken me to places
That I never thought I’d go and I am ready to be home
And I think of every spark every whisper in the dark, now it’s time
Just wanna die with the one I love
Just wanna die with the one I love beside me

Love love love

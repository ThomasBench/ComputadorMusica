One day you'll grow up and be distressed
One day you'll grow up and reject everything
I've set out for you
My only dear long wasteful son
One day you'll wonder what you've become
One day all this could be yours if
You only had the will to outlive
Your mother and I
Looking in, from the outside
Couldn't see it was true
Oh my dear, dark child
I've been waiting for you
Looking in, from the outside
Couldn't see it was true
You've been given too much time
Oh my darling
I've been waiting for you
Waiting for you
Waiting for you
Waiting for you
Although the news came as no surprise
I always hoped I'd never have to bury a child

1,If It Takes A Lifetime,Jason Isbell,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jason-isbell/if-it-takes-a-lifetime-chords-1774724,"I been working here, Monday, it'll be a year
And I can't recall a day when I didn't wanna disappear
But I keep on showing up, hell-bent on growing up
If it takes a lifetime
I'm learning how to be alone, fall asleep with the TV on
And I fight the urge to live inside my telephone
I keep my spirits high, find happiness by and by
If it takes a lifetime
I got too far from my raisin', I forgot where I come from
And the line between right and wrong was so fine
Well I thought the highway loved me
But she beat me like a drum
My day will come, if it takes a lifetime
I don't keep liquor here, never cared for wine or beer
And working for the county keeps me pissin' clear
The nights are dry as dust, but I'm letting my eyes adjust
If it takes a lifetime
I got too far from my raisin', I forgot where I come from
And the line between right and wrong was so fine
Well I thought the highway loved me
But she beat me like a drum
My day will come, if it takes a lifetime
Man is a product of all the people that he ever loved
And it don't make a difference how it ended up
If I loved you once my friend, oh, I can do it all again
If it takes a lifetime
We got too far from our raisin' and we fought 'til we went numb
You were running up a mountain in your own mind
And I thought that I was running to 
But I was running from
Oh, our day will come, if it takes a lifetime
Our day will come, if it takes a lifetime

Spent his life livin' off the land,
Dirty hands, and a clean soul.
It breaks his heart seein' foreign cars,
Filled with fuel that isn't ours
And wearin' cotton we didn't grow
He's got the red, white, and blue flyin' high on the farm
Semper Fi tattooed on his left arm
Spend a little more in the store for a tag in the back that says ‘USA’
He won't buy nothin' that he can't fix,
With WD40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudiced, he's just made in America
He loves his wife and she’s that wife
That decorates on the Fourth of July
But says 'Every day's Independence Day'
She's golden rule, teaches school,
Some folks say it isn't cool
But she says the Pledge of Allegiance anyway.

Tears filled the eyes of their loved ones and their brothers in arms
And so it went, for Joseph Warren
It should have been different
It could have been easy
His rank could have saved him
But a country unborn needs bravery
And it spread like wildfire
Wildfire
From the ashes grew sweet liberty
Like the seeds of the pines when the forest burns
They open up to grow and burn again
It should have been different
It could have been easy
But too much money rolled in to ever end slavery
The cry for war spread like wildfire
Wildfire
Wildfire
Civil War came, Civil War went
Brother fought the brother, the South was spent
But its true demise was hatred passed down through the years
It should have been different
It could have been easy
But pride has a way of holding too firm to history
And it burns like wildfire
Wildfire
Wildfire
I was a born a southern son
In a small southern town where the rebels run wild
They beat their chests and they swear we're going to rise again
It should have been different
It could have been easy
The day that old Warren died hate should have gone with him
But here we are caught in the wildfire

That first port call in Thailand feels like a pollywog turning nineteen
They've got king cobras fighting in boxing rings and all the angels play Connect Four
Seems like a sailor's paradise but turns out to be a bad dream

On to Busan, Pohang, Pattaya to Phuket, Singapore to Kuala Lumpur
Seeing damn near the whole damn world from the inside of a bar
I got sea stories, and they're all true
Might seem a bit far fetched, why would I lie to you
Memories in ink forever stained still got salt runnin' through my veins
I got sea stories, and my shell back too
Sometimes sirens send a ship off course, horizon gets so hazy
Maybe get high, play a little GoldenEye, on that ole 64
And if you get sick, and can't manage to kick, and get yourself kicked out of the Navy
And spend the next year trying to score from a futon, life raft on the floor 
And the next fifteen trying to figure out what the hell you did that for 
Well flying high beats dying for lies in a politicians war

Tempered glass on a window pane
Timeless face on a pocket watch
Time is ticking
I leave it all in ruins
'Cause I don't know what I'm doing
I'm hard on things that matter
Hold a heart so tight it shatters
So I stay away from things that break
Can't make a man a promise With the best of intentions
Drive two hundred miles on a rundown engine
Put a blanket underneath a hollow tree
When the wind blows hard it will fall on me
Stick around long and you will see
Time is ticking
I leave it all in ruins
'Cause I don't know what I'm doing
I'm hard on things that matter
Hold a heart so tight it shatters
So I stay away from things that break
Me, I don't ever wanna get too close
Or be held responsible
For the pain that you can't see
Somebody once broke me
I leave it all in ruins
'Cause I don't know what I'm doing
I'm hard on things that matter
Hold a heart so tight it shatters
So I stay away from things that break

Bout to open up a big old can of good times, unwind
Falling in and out of love in the same night
In the same night
There's ball caps, photographs, dollar bills, and bras
License plates from every state nailed up to the wall
Spring breakers, heart breakers, already getting loud
Talledega's on the big screen, don't it make you proud?
Sitting here at the Flora-Bama
Bout to open up a big old can of good times, unwind
Falling in and out of love in the same night
Can't say I got a whole lot of cares
I'm in the red neck riviera
It's getting crazy, getting hammered
Sitting right here at the Flora-Bama
At the Flora-Bama
There's high tide, low tide, years of history
Hurricanes with different names that almost took the beach
The sign says live your life just for inspiration
Gonna raise a lot of hell tonight in the, in the no shoes nation

Or maybe the coast of Californ.
So it's fare thee well my one true love,
We'll meet another day, another time.
It ain't the leavin'
That's a-grievin' me
But my true love who's bound to stay behind.
Oh the weather is against me and the wind blows hard
And the rain she's a-turnin' into hail.
I still might strike it lucky on a highway goin' west,
Though I'm travelin' on a path beaten trail.
So it's fare thee well my own true love,
We'll meet another day, another time.
It ain't the leavin'

I will write you a letter from time to time,
As I'm ramblin' you can travel with me too.
With my head, my heart and my hands, my love,
I will send what I learn back home to you.
So it's fare thee well my own true love,
We'll meet another day, another time.
It ain't the leavin'
That's a-grievin' me
But my true love who's bound to stay behind.
I will tell you of the laughter and of troubles,
Be them somebody else's or my own.
With my hands in my pockets and my coat collar high,
I will travel unnoticed and unknown.
So it's fare thee well my own true love,
We'll meet another day, another time.
It ain't the leavin'
That's a-grievin' me
But my true love who's bound to stay behind.
I've heard tell of a town where I might as well be bound,
It's down around the old Mexican plains.
They say that the people are all friendly there
And all they ask of you is your name.

I could swing a metal mallet sure and straight
But I took to the highway, a poet young and hungry

Things were going great
Til they fell apart again
So I listened to the preacher
As he told me what to do
Said you can’t go hating others
Who have done wrong to you
Sometimes we get angry
But we must not condemn
Let the good Lord do his job
And you just pray for them
I pray your brakes go out
I pray a flower pot falls
And knocks you in the head like I’d like to
I pray your birthday comes and nobody calls
I pray your flying high when your engine stalls
I pray all your dreams never come true
Just know wherever you are
Honey, I pray for you
Really glad I found my way to church
Cause I’m already feeling better and I thank God for the words
So I’m gonna take the high road
And do what the preacher told me to do
You keep messing up

Wherever you are honey, I pray for you

Waves playing me
As I lay drifting on the ocean
With this bottle in my hand
Sat down on the boardwalk
Something 'bout this place
You always loved this island breeze
The wind whistling 'cross my bottle
Still can't blow away the sorrow
That tomorrow you won't be here with me
So I raise it up and toast
The day we met and won't forget
The way you love me
The amazing way you love me
It's bittersweet, you see
You're not here but I can feel you
Every memory is on the tip of my tongue
Close my eyes, see your face
Hold on tight to yesterday
Praying when I wake, it was just a dream
It's bittersweet
Doctor said there's nothing we can do
To the only place with half a chance
Make me feel alive before I go
You said life is only borrowed
So let's wash away our sorrow
That tomorrow I won't be here with you
Go and live your life with no regrets
And don't forget how much I love you
I love you
It's bittersweet, you see
You're not here but I can feel you
Every memory is on the tip of my tongue
Close my eyes, see your face
Hold on tight to yesterday
Praying when I wake, it was just a dream
It's bittersweet
I brought you back just like you wanted
So you don't ever have to leave
When I poured you 'cross the southern sky
I couldn't help but to cry
I know you finally got your wings
Bitter, bittersweet
Bittersweet, 
Ooooooooooooh
The wind whistling 'cross my bottle
Still can't blow away the sorrow
That tomorrow you won't be here with me

Take a tropic holiday
Say goodbye to keeping time
Wasting away down by the coast
Pacifico and chasing lime
Easy living down in paradise

Move the sand beneath my feet
Reggae on the radio
Laying low and feeling high
Easy living down in paradise

Make it a strong one
We're gonna have some fun tonight
Just like the other one
Make it a double rum

Ride the waves like we're young
‘Cause time flies by and soon we'll be older
It's better to live in the moment
Than stuck in the past
Fast asleep as the world passes by
Ay ay yo
Where reality is history
Oh yo eh
Come and castaway with me
Ay ay yo
The good times are free and
Nobody can take that away
Oh yo eh
Come and castaway with me
Pour me another one
Make it a strong one

Son I'm not so sure you can be saved
He said life is full of choices
And HE sees all the bad ones that you've made
And I said Yeah you're right I'll probably go to Hell
But Goddamn all the stories I can tell

I did them for you

the sun-burned hands..I used to hold.
Since you went away, the days grow long.

But I miss you most of all, my dar..ling,..

beneath the stars all alone.

enchantment strange as the blue up above
a moonlit pass that only she would know.
Still hears my broken song of love.
Moon in all your splendor
Know only my heart
Call back my rose, Rose of San Antone
Lips so sweet and tender
Like petals fallin' apart
Speak once again of my love, my own
A broken song, empty words I know
That live in my heart all alone
For that moonlit path beside the Alamo
And Rose, my Rose of San Antone.
Well the, Moon in all your splendor,
Know only my heart

When the Ford and the Mercury were setting the pace
That story is true I'm here to say
‘Cause I was driving that Model A
It's got a Lincoln motor and it’s really souped up
That Model A body makes it look like a pup
It's got eight cylinders use them all
With an overdrive that just won't stall
Got a four barrel carb and dual exhaust
Four eleven gears really get lost
Got safety tubes and I’m not scared
Brakes are good and the tires are fair
We left San Pedro late one night
The Moon and the stars were shinin’ bright
And that thing went flyin’ up the Grapevine Hill
We were passing cars like they were standing still
And all of a sudden like the flick of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by
The mark was made that’s the car for me
But then the tail lights was all you could see
Well the fella’s ribbed me for being behind
So I started to make that Lincoln unwind
Took my foot off the gas man alive
I shoved it down into overdrive
But I wound it up to a 110
Twisted the speed-o-meter cable off hand
Had my foot be cleared the floor
Says that's all there is ain't no more
Went around the corner passed a truck
I crossed my fingers just for luck
The fenders clicking the guard rail posts
The guy beside me white as a ghost
I guess they thought I had lost a sense
The telephone posts looked like a picket fence
He said slow down I see spots
The lines on the road they just look like dots
Smoke was rolling out from the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac
I knew I could catch him and I hope I could pass
When I did I’ll be short on gas
Went around the corner with the tires on the side
You could feel the tension man what a ride
I said hold on I got a license to fly
And the Cadillac pulled over and let me by
And all of a sudden the rod started knockin’
Down in the dips it started rockin’
I looked in the mirror the red light was blinkin’
The cops were there for my hot rod Lincoln
Well, they arrested me and they put me in jail
I told my Pop to throw my bail
He said son you gonna drive me to drinkin’
If you don’t quit drivin’ that hot rod Lincoln

Ma tu, tu fuggirai
e nella notte ti perderai
e sola, sola, sola nel buio mi chiamerai.
Ti voglio cullare, cullare
Posandoti su un'onda del mare, del mare
Legandoti a un granello di sabbia
Così tu nella nebbia più fuggir non potrai
E accanto a me tu resterai
[Verse 3]
Ti voglio tenere, tenere
Legata con un raggio di sole, di sole
Così col suo calore la nebbia svanirà
E il tuo cuore riscaldarsi potrà
E mai più freddo sentirai
Ma tu, tu fuggirai
e nella notte ti perderai
e sola, sola, sola nel buio mi chiamerai.
Ti voglio cullare, cullare
Posandoti su un'onda del mare, del mare
Legandoti a un granello di sabbia
Così tu nella nebbia più fuggir non potrai
E accanto a me tu resterai   ai  iai  iai  iai
ai ai iai iai iai

So break out the bottle bring on the crowd
Tell funny stories turn the jukebox up loud
Come and sit at my table where the drinks are on me

To a false hearted woman with a false hearted dream
But this time is the first time I've suffered myself
Help me get over this love I'll handle the next love all by myself

Lonely there she kneels and tells the stars above
In her arms he belongs in her heart is a song
An undying song of love

Said it really was a simple way to die
He laid down to rest one afternoon
And never opened up his eyes 
They hired me and Fred and Joe
To dig the grave and carry up some chairs
It took us seven hours
And I guess we must have drunk a case of beer
I guess I ought to go and watch them put 'em down
But I don't own a suit
And anyway when they start talking about
The fire in hell well I get spooked
So I'll just sit here in my truck
And act like I don't know 'em when they pass
Anyway when they're all through
I've got to go to work and mow the grass
Well here they come and who's that
Riding in that big ole shiny limousine
Mmh look at all that chrome I do believe
That that's the sharpest thing I've seen
That must belong to his great uncle
Someone said he owned a big ole farm
When they get parked I'll mosey down
And look it over that won't do no harm
Well that must be the widow in the car
And would you take a look at that
That sure is a pretty dress
You know some women do look good in black
Well he's not even in the ground
And they say that his truck is up for sale
They say she took it pretty hard
But you can't tell too much behind the veil
Well listen ain't that pretty
When the bugler plays the Military taps
I think that when you was in the war
They always hide and play a song like that
Well here I am and there they go
And I guess you'd just call it my bad luck
I hope he rests in peace the trouble is
The fellow owes me forty bucks

0,Huntin Fishin And Lovin Every Day (verÂ 2),Luke Bryan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/luke-bryan/huntin-fishin-and-lovin-every-day-chords-1761372,"If I could make a livin' from walkin' in the woods
You can bet I'd be sittin' pretty good
High on a hill looking at a field down wind
If I could make a nickel off of turnin' them bass
Never worry bout the price of gas
I'd be wheelin' and dealin' and sittin' there reelin' 'em in
Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
Early in the mornin', late in the evenin'
I'm getting red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
I get a little farm pond buzz
Sound of gravel when I'm backin' up
Pullin' the string on a 9.9 two-stroke (Mercury)
I love it when my baby wants to roll with me
Throws her boots on, climbs in a tree
Tuckin' her hair in my hat and she's ready to go
And we get to huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
That's the prayer that a country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Early in the mornin', late in the evenin'
I'm getting red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
So while y'all are up there
Breathin' in that old dirty air
I'll be down here
Knee-deep in the Muckalee
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
I wanna see them tall pines sway
Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day
That's the prayer this country boy prays
Thank God He made me this way
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Black coffee in the mornin, dark whiskey in the evenin'
I'm gettin' red dirt rich and Flint River paid
Huntin', fishin' and lovin' every day
Won't you come along with me
Won't you come along with me
I know you wanna see
Huntin', fishin', and lovin' every day

1,Drunk On A Plane,Dierks Bentley,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/dierks-bentley/drunk-on-a-plane-chords-1468607,"  I took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
  A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
  I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7a
  I'm getting drunk on a plane
  I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
  Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
  Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
  I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody but the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rockin' like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pouring Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
  It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
  We had this date marked on the calendar forever
  We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
  I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody but the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rockin' like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pouring Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
  It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
they all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
  On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
  So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
  And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass
'Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane
Buyin' drinks for everybody but the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rockin' like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pouring Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
  It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
they all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane
  I'm getting drunk on a plane
  I might be passed out
  in the baggage claim
but right now
I'm drunk on a plane

Is the worst thing possible

Killin yourself won't change a god damn thing
If it's help that you need

And a storms moving in
Its been raining for 5 full days
And I know now's not the best time
But I just gotta say
That I don't-I don't-I don't love you
I don't love you
The selfish don't love nobody
And I can't love you like
You should be loved
Wasnt an accident
That a broken heart and a bullet mark was all that she left

Should be out of the question, don't ask me no questions 'cause

I never really looked out quite that far
   It's never been a simple thing
   To see the world with a young man's brain
 With an old man's heart   restless soul
Yeah my family went broke my eighteenth year
   Dad took a job many miles from here
That   that was alright by me    I was on my own
I had a band found a job   life was alright
I worked when I had to we played all the time
Only got through that first year of college alright
But I learned more on the freight docks
Driving forklifts on the 3 o'clock am shift
In the winter time   man it got cold
Selling guitars on the west coast goin' hungry
Chasin' ghost around and around we would go
And I saw it all tending bar at night
Treatin' saints and sinners right
It's a good thing to do all the time
You never know who you're talkin' to
But always know who's watching you
Keep your feet movin' straight down the line
   I've known a lot of real good men   Grad school or no school
I've called them my friends
   I'm   I'm somewhere in the middle and that's just fine
Though I don't give a damn how much money you make
If your last shirt has pockets take all you can
I'm   I'm goin' out with nothing   like I came in
'Cause I learned more on the freight docks
Driving forklifts on the 3 o'clock am shift

Get along on down the road, we've got a long, long way to go

Get along while we can, always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance, call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song, make a friend, can't we all, get along?
Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800-get-to-know-me
Wonderin' was she photoshopped or were her eyes really that lonely?
Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.?
Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?

Most of your life
Look damn good in the dress
Zipping up the mess
Dancing with your best foot forward
Does it get hard
To have to play the part?
Nobody's feeling sorry for ya
But what if I told you the world wouldn't end
If you started showing what's under your skin
What if you let 'em all in on the lie?
Even the homecoming queen cries
Hey homecoming queen
How's things at home?
Still walking on eggshells
When that curtains closed
Did your daddy teach you
How to act tough?
Or more like your momma?
Sweep it under the rug
Look damn good in the dress
Zipping up the mess
Dancing with your best foot forward
Did you want the crown
Or does it weigh you down
Nobody's feeling sorry for ya
What if I told you the world wouldn't end
If you started showing what's under your skin?
What if you let 'em all in on the lie?
Even the homecoming queen cries
Yeah, what if I told you the sky wouldn't fall?
If you lost your composure, said to hell with it all
Not everything pretty sparkles and shines
And even the homecoming queen cries
Oh yeah
Even the homecoming queen cries
Hey homecoming queen
Why do you lie
When somebody's mean?
Where do you hide?

Like dreams ainât just for dreamers
  We couldnât wait to leave that life behind
   Trying to find salvation in that city limit sign

They drown the downtown lights

  Everybodyâs got a part to play
  Everybodyâs trying to find a way
To say what needs saying
  Everybodyâs got a friend of a friend
  Somebody that can get you in
  Begging angels for a sin
In a game that weâre all playing
  You and I weâre gamblers, holding cards that we canât see
  And Iâm betting on you, and youâre betting on me

Your pretty little head on my shoulder
Pull over on the side of the road

Like nothing I've ever seen
If I'm asleep girl, let me dream
Baby fall into my kiss

Trust it so much that there's no one else but us and
This moment that says it's so right
Cause that's all we have in this life
Drink up this love, baby, give it all we got tonight
Summer honeysuckle
Leaking through a rolled down window
We both know when that seat lays back
Anything can happen
So imagine it'll never end
Just close your eyes and you can see that we are where we're meant to be

I hope those bricks and boards can take it

Time moved too fast, you play it back
Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
No proof not much, but you saw enough
Small talk, he drives coffee at midnight, 
the light reflects, the chain on your neck
 He says look up and your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch you felt enough
 You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out, you
You're in love, true love
You're in love
Morning, his place burn toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
And for once you let go, of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kissed on sidewalks, you fight and you talk
One night he wakes, strange look on his face
Pauses, then says, you're my best friend
And you knew what it was, he is in love
 You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out, you
You're in love, true love
And so it goes
And he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown
 And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
 And why I've spent my whole life try to put it into words
 Cause you can hear in the silence
 You can feel it on the way home
 You can see it with the lights out 
You're in love, true love
You're in love, you can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you

Dropped a dozen cheap roses in my shopping cart
Made it out to the truck without breaking down
Everybody knows you in a speed trap town
It's a Thursday night but there's a high school game
Sneak a bottle up the bleachers and forget my name
These 5-A bastards run a shallow cross
It's a boy's last dream and a man's first loss
And it never did occur to me to leave, 'til tonight
There's no one left to ask if I'm all right
Sleep until I'm straight enough to drive, then decide
If there's anything that can't be left behind
The doctor said daddy wouldn't make it a year
But the holidays are over and he's still here
How long can they keep you in the ICU
Veins through the skin like a faded tattoo
Was a tough state trooper 'til a decade back
When that girl who wasn't mama caused his heart attack
He didn't care about us when he was walkin' around
Just pulling women over in a speed trap town
But it never did occur to me to leave, 'til tonight
When I realized he'll never be all right
Sign my name and say my last goodbye, then decide
That there's nothing here that can't be left behind
Roads got blurry when the sun came up
Slept a couple hours in the pickup truck
Drank a cup of coffee by an Indian mound
Thousand miles away from that speed trap town
Thousand miles away from that speed trap town

She said she had a man back home that she'd been leavin' for some time
He lived just across the Georgia line

Told me she's from Montgomery, but I've seen those Georgia plates
And every time she gets alone with me, I see Georgia on her mind

Well, I got a little bit of huntin' land just outside of Phenix City
And even though it's right down the road, she couldn't find the time to see me
Well pretty soon it's just a text she'd send with a line from her favorite song
But I was writin' one of my own
Well, she's all Alabama, but she's got her feet stuck in the Georgia clay
And she's got a couple bulldog jerseys, but she's never seen them play
And every time she gets a- lone with me, I see Georgia on her mind

Thereâs no stoppinâ me once I get goinâ, put a can in my hand, man Iâm wide ass open

Five four three two one too many
After five diet Millers I was feelinâ loose, singinâ karaoke to a TL tune
When a pretty little thing shot me a wink, she said, hey cowboy, could you buy us a drink
Well, hey baby doll, I will if you want but I canât turn it off once I turn it on

I know you're dreaming 'bout that blue flower dress
Oh but you know we can't afford things like that
Not quite yet
Don't hold your breath
And I'm sorry for the things
That I said when I was drunk
I didn't mean em then
And I hope you lied when you whispered goodbye
Through teary eyes
I'm fighting off my demons but they're not quite dead
With their single barreled shotgun and Johnny Walker Red
But when the bottle is empty you're the guns to my head
And I regret
Oh every step
And I'm sorry for the things
That I said when I was drunk
I didn't mean em then
And I hope you lied when you whispered goodbye
Through teary eyes
And I've been flipping through the sketches you drew
Some of them are shining and some of them are blue
Oh because one day I'm a sweetheart and the next I'm a brute
And you're so confused
Oh what's the use
And I'm sorry for the things
That I said when I was drunk
I didn't mean em then
And I hope you lied when you whispered goodbye

No, I don't want to fall in love. (This world is only gonna break your heart)
What a wicked game to play, to make me feel this way.
What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you.

What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you.

Lost my wife and a girlfriend somewhere along the way

I set out to get you with a fine tooth comb.
I was soft inside, there was something goin' on
You do something to me that I can't explain
  Hold me closer and I feel no pain, ev'ry beat of my heart
We got something goin' on
Tender love is blind, it requires a dedication
  All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh
Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, uh huh
From one lover to another, uh huh
I can't live without you if the love was gone
Ev'rything is nothing if you got no one
And you did walk in the night
Slowly losin' sight of the real thing
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
  Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear, this could be the year
For the real thing
No more will you cry. Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one in love forever we can
Ride it together, uh huh
Makin' love with each other, uh huh

Did families really bow their heads to pray?
Did daddies really never go away?

 Pour myself a cup of ambition
 And yawn n` stretch n` and try to come to life
 Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin`
 Out on the streets the traffic starts jumpin`
 With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5
 Workin` 9 to 5 - what a way to make a livin`
 Barely gettin` by - it`s all takin` and no givin`
They just use your mind - and they never give you credit
 It`s enough to drive you crazy if you let it
 9 to 5 - for service and devotion
 You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
 Want to move ahead but the boss won`t seem to let me
 I swear sometimes that man is out to get me mmmmmmm
 They let you dream just to watch `em shatter
 You`re just a step on the boss man`s ladder
 But you got dreams he`ll never take away
 In the same boat with a lot of your friends
 Waitin` for the day your ship`ll come in
 And the tide`s gonna turn, an` it`s all gonna roll your way
 Workin` 9 to 5 - what a way to make a livin`
 Barely gettin` by - it`s all takin` and no givin`
 They just use your mind - and you never get the credit
 It`s enough to drive you crazy if you let it
 9 to 5, yeah - they got you where they want you
 There`s a better life - and you think about it don`t you
 It`s a rich man`s game - no matter what they call it
 And you spend your life putting money in his wallet
 9 to 5 - what a way to make a livin`
 Barely gettin` by - it`s all takin` and no givin`

7,If Tomorrow Never Comes,Garth Brooks,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/garth-brooks/if-tomorrow-never-comes-chords-62607,"Sometimes late at night
I lie awake and watch her sleeping
She's lost in peaceful dreams
So I turn out the lights and lay there in the dark
And the thought crosses my mind
If I never wake up in the morning
Would she ever doubt the way I feel
About her in my heart
If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face this world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes
'Cause I've lost love ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelings for them never were revealed
So I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel
If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face this world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes
So tell that someone that you love
Just what you`re thinking of
If tomorrow never comes

Was gonna keep you free and clean
And now you wear your skin like iron
And your breath's as hard as kerosene
Weren't your mama's only boy
But her favorite one, it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
(And) sank into your dreams
Pancho was a bandit, boys
His horse was fast as polished steel
He wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
Well, Pancho met his match, you know
On the deserts down in Mexico
Nobody heard his dyin' words
Ah, but that's the way it goes
All the federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him slip away
Out of kindness, I suppose
Lefty he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to
The dust that Pancho bit down South
Ended up in Lefty's mouth
The day they laid poor Pancho low
Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to go
There ain't nobody knows
All the federales say
They could have had him any day
We only let him slip away
Out of kindness, I suppose
The poets tell how Pancho fell
And Lefty's livin' in a cheap hotel
The desert's quiet, and Cleveland's cold
And so the story ends, we're told
Pancho needs your prayers, it's true
But save a few for Lefty, too
He only did what he had to do
And now he's growin' old
All the federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him go so long

They could have had him any day
They only let him go so long

He never came back from Copperhead Road

Heard mama cryin', knew something wasn't right
He was headed down to Knoxville with the weekly load
You could smell the whiskey burnin' down Copperhead Road
I volunteered for the Army on my birthday
I done two tours of duty in Vietnam
I take the seed from Colombia and Mexico

Wildflowers don't care where they grow
And the flowers I knew in the fields where I grew
Were content to be lost in the crowd
They were commonly close I had no room to grow
And I wanted so much to branch out
So I uprooted myself from my home ground and left
Took my dreams and I took to the road-o-oad
When a flower grows wild it can always survive
Wildflowers don't care where they grow
I grew up fast and wild and I never felt right
In a garden so different from me
I just never belonged I just longed to be gone
So the garden one day set me free
I hitched a ride with the wind and since he was my friend
I just let him decide where we'd go-o-o

No regrets for the path that I chose-o-ose

Deeper than the oceans higher than the stars a -bove.
Well I come from the country and I know I ain't seen it all.
But I heard that ocean's salty and the stars they sometimes fall.
And that would not do justice to the way I feel for you.
So I had to sing a song about all the things I knew.
My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the river.
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill.
My love is purer than the snowflakes, that fall in late De -cember.
And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill.
And longer than the song of a whippoor-
-will
From the back-roads to the Broadway shows with a million miles be -tween
There's a least a million love songs that people love to sing
And everyone is different and everyone's the same
An' this is just a -nother way of sayin' the same thing
My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the river
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late De -cember
And ho nest as a robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of a whippoor-
will
[Chorus]
My love is deeper than the holler, stronger than the river
Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill
My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late De -cember
And honest as a robin on a springtime window sill
And longer than the song of a whippoor-

Long ago in the sweet used to be
And the flowers still grow but they don't smell as sweet
As they did when you picked them for me
And when I think of you and the love we once knew

Or do I ever cross your mind?
Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night because you
Miss me, do you Darling?

Oh, and do you ever miss the feelings and the love we shared when you were
With me, do you Darling?
I just wonder do I cross your mind?
Oh, how often I wish that again I could kiss
Your sweet lips like I did long ago
And how often I long for those two lovin' arms
That once held me so gentle and close
And when I think of you and the love we once knew
How I wish we could go back in time (go back in time)

Now she worries cause she never thought, I'd ever really take it this far
Singin' in the bars
Chasin' that neon rainbow, livin' that honky tonk dream

 Just tryin' to be somebody, just wanna be heard and seen
Chasin' that neon rainbow, Livin' that honky tonk dream
An atlas and a coffe cup, five pickers in an old Dodge truck
Headin' down to Houston, for a show on Saturday night
This overhead is killin' me, half the time I sing for free
But when the crowd's into it, lord it makes this thing I'm doing seem right
Standin' in the spotlight
Chasin' that neon rainbow, livin' that honky tonk dream

 Just tryin' to be somebody, just wanna be heard and seen
Chasin' that neon rainbow, Livin' that honky tonk dream
Daddy's got a radio, he won it thirty years ago
He said ""Son I just know we're gonna hear you singin' on it someday""
I made it up to Music Row, but lordy don't the wheels turn slow
Still I wouldn't trade a minute, and I wouldn't have it any other way
Just show me to the stage

Healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
Waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
Wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I've been
Teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
Talking of tomorrow and the money, love and time we'd have to spend
Loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
Coming close together with a feeling that I've never known before, in my time
She ain't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend

But I gave up my home to see you satisfied.
And I just called to let you know where I'll be living.
It's not much, but I feel welcome here inside.
And I've got swinging doors, a jukebox and a bar stool.
And my new home has a flashing neon sign.
Stop by and see me anytime you want to.
Cause I'm always here at home till closing time.
I've got everything I need to drive me crazy.
And I've got everything it takes to lose my mind.
And in here the atmosphere's just right for heartaches.
And thanks to you I'm always here till closing time.
And I've got swinging doors, a jukebox and a bar stool.
And my new home has a flashing neon sign.
Stop by and see me anytime you want to.
Cause I'm always here at home till closing time.
I'm always here at home till closing time.

The queen of the Delta Land
Then you'll understand 
Why I've got the Blues For Dixie.
If you've ever been, to Tennessee when
Those old cotton fields were white
In pale moonlight
Then you've had the Blues For Dixie.
If you've seen the glamour, of the Alabama
Moon shining in the sky, if you've got a baby
In Birmingham maybe, then you'll know the reason why
That I'm gonna be blue, til I'm on that old choo choo
Headin' down South again
There goes that train
That's leavin' me Blue For Dixie.

Don't look at me like you want me to plead

While we've been living in a country rock band
We've got to slow down, calm down
We got to get off of this merry-go-round

If you see James Dean, tell him I said hello
Janis sang here, Jimi did too
They're saving a place there for me   and  you
There's gonna be a rock and roll holiday
We've got to get there in time to play
Tune up the fiddle, rosin the bow
We could be the only country band on a rock and roll show
We've got to get up, no time to hit up
There's another crowd waiting for the music to play
Slow down - come down

And each precious vow you tried to keep.
I love you so much I want you happy,

With new love its useless to compete.
It hurts me to know you are unhappy,

Step aside if I try to get near you 
Lock your heart if I start making time
Walk away if I say that I need you 
Step aside if I step out of line
Bitter is my feelings for my baby and the things she said so cruel
Half of me says cheat on her but part of me says stop don't be a fool
Don't let me get close to you cause if I do I won't be very strong
Save me from my conscience and keep me from being sorry later on

They said for the last two weeks that he suffered and cried
It made a big impression on me although I was a barefoot kid
They said he got religion at the end and I'm glad that he did
Clayton was the best guitar picker in our town
I thought he was a hero and I used to follow Clayton around
I often wondered why Clayton who seemed so good to me
Never took his guitar and made it down in Tennessee
Well daddy said he drank a lot but I could never understand
I knew he used to picked up in Ohio with a five piece band
Clayton used to tell me son you better put that old guitar away
Ain't no money in it it'll lead you to an early grave
I guess if I'd admit it Clayton taught me how to drink booze
I can see him half stoned a picking out the Lovesick Blues
When Clayton died I made him a promise I was gonna carry on somehow
I'd give a hundred dollars if he could only see me now
I remember the year that Clayton Delaney died
Nobody ever knew it but I went out in the woods and I cried
Well I know there's a lotta big preachers that know a lot more than I do
But it could be that the good Lord likes a little picking too
Yeah I remember the year that Clayton Delaney died

you favor I girl that I knew
I imagine that she's back in Tennessee,
and by God, I should be there too;
I've a sadness too sad to be true
But I left Tennessee in a hurry dear,
in same way that I'm leaving you
Because love is mainly just memories, you see,
and everyone's got him a few;
so when I'm gone I'll be glad to love you
At the Brand New Tennessee Waltz,
you're literally waltzing on air
At the Brand New Tennessee Waltz,
there's no telling who will be there
When I leave it will be like I found you love,
descending Victorian stairs
And I'm feeling like one of your old photographs, girl,
where I m trapped while I m putting on airs;
so I ll get even by saying who cares?
At the Brand New Tennessee Waltz,
you're literally waltzing on air
At the Brand New Tennessee Waltz,
there's just no telling who will be there
So have all of your passionate violins,
play a tune for a Tennessee kid
Who's feeling like leaving another town,
but with no place to go if he did;
cause they'll catch you wherever you're hid
At the Brand New Tennessee Waltz,
you're literally waltzing on air

there's just no telling who will be there

There's a place in the sun and before my life is done
Gotta find me a place in the sun

48,Born To Lose,Eddy Arnold,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/eddy-arnold/born-to-lose-chords-1789743,"Born to lose I've lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue
Born to lose and now I'm losing you
Born to lose it seems so hard to bear
How I long to always have you near
You've grown tired and now you say we're through
Born to lose and now I'm losing you
Born to lose my every hope is gone
It's so hard to face an empty dawn
You were all the happiness I knew
Born to lose and now I'm losing you
There's no use to dream of happiness
All I see is only loneliness
All my life I've always been so blue
Born to lose and now I'm losing you
Born to lose and now I'm losing you

49,Talking In Your Sleep,Crystal Gayle,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/crystal-gayle/talking-in-your-sleep-chords-1797626,"Three o'clock in the morning
And it's looks like it's gonna be
Another sleepless night
I've been listenin' to your dreams
And gettin' very low
Wonderin' what I can do
Maybe I'm bein' foolish 'cause I haven't heard you mention
Anybody's name at all  how I wish I could be sure
It's me that turns you on  each time you close your eyes
I've heard it said that dreamers never lie
You've been talking in your sleep sleepin' in your dreams
With some sweet lover  holdin' on so tight
Lovin her the way you used to love me 
Talking in your sleep with loving on your mind
Maybe I'm bein' foolish 'cause I haven't heard you mention
Anybody's name at all  how I wish I could be sure
It's me that turns you on  each time you close your eyes
I've heard it said that dreamers never lie
You've been talking in your sleep sleepin' in your dreams
With some sweet lover  holdin' on so tight
Lovin her the way you used to love me
Talking in your sleep with loving on your mind

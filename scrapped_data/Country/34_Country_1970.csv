But then I know it?s going strong
First was the spring, and spring became a summer
Who?d have believe you?d come along.
Hands, touching hands
Reaching out, touching me, touching you.
Sweet Caroline, good times never seemed so good
I?m inclined, to believe there never would.
Look at the night, and it don?t seem so lonely
We fill it up with only two
And when I hurt, it runs off of my shoulder
How can I hurt when holding you.
Warm, touching warm
Reachin? out, touching me, touching you.
Sweet Caroline, good times never seemed so good.

I     knew a man
Bo -           jangles and he’ll      dance for you

         Ragged shirt and       baggy pants

   Dance 
I    met him in a 
         Cell in New      Orleans, when       I was … 
   Down and     out 
He    looked to me to 
         Be the      eyes of      age
   He spoke right     out
He     talked of    life, 
   He talked of     life 
       He laughed, clicked his heels    instead 
He    said his name, 
Bo -          jangles, then he      danced a lick 
   Across the     cell 
He     grabbed his pants a 
         Better stance, he       jumped up high 
   He clicked his     heels
   He let go a    laugh 
He     let go a      laugh

   Mr. bo-    jangles, 
   Mr. bo-    jangles, 
   Dance 
He    danced for those at 
         Minstrel shows and       country fairs 
   Throughout the     South 
He     spoke with tears 
Of           15 years, how his       dog and him 
   Travelled a-    bout
   His dog up and    died, 
   Up and     died 
       After 20 years he still    greaves 
He     said “I dance now at 
         Ev’ ry chance in       honky tonks 
   For drinks and     tips 
But    most the time 
I          spend behind these      country bars 
   ‘Cause I drink a    bit’”
  He shook his    head, and 
    As he shook his      head 
I         heard someone ask him    “please”

But my lady knows I've got to go

I made my plans but I was wrong yes I was wrong

saw the impress on the pillow where you laid your head.
The presence of you still lingered all, all around,

Then I felt the lonely dragging down my face,
as I realized  no one could take your place.
I wondered where the love had gone that you and me had felt,

He listens to a passing train
Gives into an old familiar pain, familiar pain
They retired him twenty years ago, gave him a watch made of gold and took his train
His woman's name was Margaret
He loved her but she went away and left his heart undone
He called this train the Diplomat, she's the only other lady that he ever loved
Some forty years he made the steam
From Memphis down to New Orleans but now he's off the line
And the closest that he ever gets Margaret or the Diplomat is in his mind
He said, take me to the station
The Diplomat is bringing Margaret home
Can't you hear that whistle blowing?
They both know I've been alone for much too long
Let's not keep them waiting
We'll talk about the good times later on
Right now take me to the station

They say he talks crazy when
He sees the passing train or when he hears Margaret's name
But the only things he ever loved, he lost before he loved enough he's not to blame
So who's to say he's right or wrong
Reaching out and hanging on to dreams he can't let go
He threw the watch of gold away but keeps tracks of memories where he belongs

Illinois Central Monday morning rail
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail.
All along the south bound odyssey, the train pulls out of Kenkakee
Rolls along past houses farms and fields
Passing trains that have no name, freight yards of old black men
And graveyards of rusted automobiles.
Good morning America, how are you?
Say, don't you know me, I'm your native son.
I'm a train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done.
Dealing card games with the old men in the club car
Penny a point ain't noone keeping score
Pass the paper bag but hold the bottle
Feel the wheels rumbling 'neath the floor
And the sons of Pullman porters, and the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpets made of steel
Mother with her babes asleep, rocking to the gentle beat
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel.
Nightime on the City of New Orleans
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee
Half way home we'll be there by morning
through the Mississippi darkness rolling down to the sea.
and all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream
And the steel rail still ain't heard the news
The conductor sings his songs again, the passagers will please refrain
This train got the disappearing railroad blues.
Good night America, How are you?
Say, don't you know me, I'm your native son.
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans

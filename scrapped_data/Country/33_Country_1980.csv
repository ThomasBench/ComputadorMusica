In an Alberta rail yard with my red faced hobo friends
Here comes a train east bound for Nova Scotia shore
It's my last ride my friends ain't gonna hobo no more
So long BC Benning you have been a real good friend
And goodbye Boxcar Willie I guess I won't see you again
Here comes a train homebound for Nova Scotia shore
It's my last ride my friend ain't gonna hobo no more
No one loves a hobo and I need some love
Yes I'm always so hungry and I never get enough
And no one wants a hobo hanging round their doors
It's my last ride my friends ain't gonna hobo no more
There's a man in Halifax that will give this bum a job
I'll use the money to find a woman I can love
Here comes a train east bound for Nova Scotia shore
It's my last ride my friends ain't gonna hobo no more
No one loves a hobo and I need some love
Yes I'm always so hungry and I never get enough
And no one wants a hobo hanging round their doors
It's my last ride my friends ain't gonna hobo no more
It's my last ride my friends ain't gonna hobo no more

4,The Cowboy Who Started The Fight,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/the-cowboy-who-started-the-fight-chords-4049128,"The legs on the lady a walkin'
Was tanned to a dark berry brown
Her body was made like a song to be played
To the tune of a million a pound
She was a wonder of a woman I reckon
And she sure screwed her head on right
The toast of the world was the long legged girl
And the cowboy who started the fight
 He'd just pulled into town in an old green 1953 Chevrolet pickup truck
With whiskey bumps all over it and the right front fender falling off
 He coasted on into a no parking zone, got out and took the keys and chunked 'em down a gutter
Turned around and just walked off
He allowed how his time had been wasted
On drinking and running around
He spent half his life searchin' barrooms at night
For the sweetheart that he never found
It was plain from the moment their eyes met
They'd wind up in each others arms
The lady's young life was laid open that night
And the cowboy drank deep of her charms
Singing hey-hi-de-he from the depths of the sea
To the mountains so hollering high
I've found the best one under God's given sun
Yeah the cowboy got lucky tonight
While the angel beside him lay sleeping
He silently thanked God above
For being a kind hearted father
And blessing his love with her love
For one night of love with that woman
Was more than he knew he deserved
So he found all he had left worth givin'
And he gave all he had left to her
He slid back inside his ole levi's
And he filled up his boots with his feet
While the subways beneath New York City
Screamed through the veins of the street
For the lady gave up without question
The trophy she saved all her life
Then she curled up beside his old weather worn hide
And the cowboy just laid down and died
Hey-hi-de-hi with a whoop through the street
As his soul slowly winged out of sight
The lady was torn from the child bein' born
And the cowboy found heaven that night
The lady was torn from the child bein' born
And the cowboy found heaven that night

5,The Reverend Mr Black,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/the-reverend-mr-black-chords-4054675,"He was a mountain of a man and I want you to know
He could preach hot hell or freezin' snow
He carried a Bible in a canvas sack
And everybody called him The Reverend Mr. Black
He was poor as a beggar but he rode like a king
Sometimes in the evening, I can hear him sing
I gotta walk that lonesome valley
I gotta walk it by myself
There ain't nobody here can walk it for me
I gotta walk it by myself
If ever I could have thought this man in black
Was soft and had any yellow up his back
I gave that notion up the very day
A lumberjack came in and it wasn't to pray
He kicked open the meeting house door
And he cussed everybody up and down the floor
Then, when things got quiet all over the place
He walked up and cusses in the preacher's face
He hit that reverend like a kick of a mule
And to my way of thinkin' it took a real fool
To turn the other cheek to that lumberjack
But that's what he did, The Reverend Mr. Black
He stood like a rock, a man among men
And then he let that lumberjack hit him again
And then with a voice as kind as could be
He cut him down like a big oak tree, when he said
You gotta walk that lonesome valley
You gotta walk it by yourself
There ain't nobody here can walk it for you
You gotta walk it by yourself
Well, it's been many years since we had to part
And I guess I learned all his ways by heart
Just I can still hear his sermon's ring
Down in the valley where he used to sing
You gotta walk that lonesome valley
You gotta walk it by yourself
There ain't nobody here can walk it for you
You gotta walk it by yourself
You gotta walk that lonesome valley
You gotta walk it by yourself
There ain't nobody here can walk it for you
You gotta walk it by yourself

6,Come From The Heart,Guy Clark,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/guy-clark/come-from-the-heart-chords-3307670,"When I was a young man, my daddy told me
A lesson he learned, it was a long time ago
If you want to have someone to hold onto
You're going to have to learn to let go
You got to sing like you don't need the money
Love like you'll never get hurt
You got to dance like nobody's watching
It's got to come from the heart if you want it to work
Now here is the one thing that I keep forgetting
When everything is falling apart
In life as in love, you know I need to remember
There's such a thing as trying too hard
You got to sing like you don't need the money
Love like you'll never get hurt
You got to dance like nobody's watching
It's got to come from the heart if you want it to work
You got to sing sometimes like you don't need the money
You got to love sometimes like you'll never get hurt
You got to dance, dance, dance like nobody's watching

7,Immigrant Eyes,Guy Clark,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/guy-clark/immigrant-eyes-chords-1143142,"Old Ellis Island was swarming, 
Like a scene from a costume ball, 
Decked out in the colors of Europe, 
On fire with the hope of it all, 
There my father's own father stood huddled 
With the tired and the hungry and scared, 
The turn of the century pilgrims, 
Bound by the dream that they shared 2 3 1 2 
They were standing in line just like cattle, 
They were poked and sorted and shoved; 
Some were one desk away from sweet freedom; 
Some were torn from someone they loved. 
Through this sprawling tower of Babel 
Came a young man confused and a-lone 
De-termined and bound for America; 
Carrying every-thing that he owned 2 3 1 2 
Some-times when I look in my grandfather's immigrant eyes 
I see that day reflected and I can't hold my feelings in-side 
I see starting with nothing and working hard all of his life 
'Don't take it for granted' say Grandfather's immigrant eyes 2 3 1 2 3 
Now he rocks and he stares out the window 
But his eyes are still just as clear 
As the day he sailed into the harbor 
To land on the island of tears 
My grandfather's days they are numbered 
But I won't let his memory die 
For he gave me the gift of this country 
And the look in his immigrant eyes 2 3 1 2 
Some-times when I look in my grandfather's immigrant eyes 
I see that day reflected and I can't hold my feelings in-side

all you keep is the gettin' there

and the pickin' down the line

on the things you leave behind

and them holes are all that's real

sometimes you dig your own
The choice is yours to make
time is yours to take
Some sail upon the sea
some toil upon the stone

15,The Way Worn Traveler,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/the-way-worn-traveler-chords-2129393,"I saw a way worn traveler in tattered garments clad,
And struggling up the mountain, it seemed that he was sad.
His back was laden heavy, his strength was almost gone,
It shouted as he journeyed, ''Deliverance will come!""
Then palms of victory, crowns of glory,
Palms of victory I shall wear.
The summer sun was shining, the sweat was on his brow,
His garments worn and dusty, his step seemed very slow.
But he kept pressing onward, for he was wending home,
Still shouting as he journeyed, ""Deliverance will come!""
Then palms of victory, crowns of glory,
Palms of victory I shall wear.
The songstress in the arbor, that stood beside the way,
Attracted his attention, inviting his delay.
His watchword being ""Onward!"" he stopped his ears and ran,
Still shouting as he journeyed, ''Deliverance will come!""
Then palms of victory, crowns of glory,
Palms of victory I shall wear. 
While gazing on that city, just o'er that narrow flood
A band of holy angels came from the throne of God.
They bore him on their pinions, they bore the dashing foam,
And joined him in his triumph, ""Deliverance has come!""
Then palms of victory, crowns of glory,
Palms of victory I shall wear.

 He was ten and it was nineteen fifty-two
 His daddy worked hard from sun up to sun down
 and the going got tuff behind them old grey mules
 The farm grew to be a money maker
 and the house he lived in grew up room by room
 The boy worked hard but soon got tired of farming
 So he slipped away one night beneath the harvest moon.
 His neck was red as Alabama clay
 but the cities ca---ll pulled him away
 He's got a factory job and runs a big machine
 He don't miss the farm or the fields of green.
 Now the cities just a prison without fences.
 His job is just a routine he can't stand
 and at night he dreams of wide open spaces
 fresh dirt beneath his toes and on his hands.
 Then one day a picture came inside a letter
 of a young girl with a baby in her arms.
 And the words she wrote would change his life forever.
 So he went to raise his family on their farm.
 His neck is red as Alabama Clay
 Now he's going ho--me this time to stay

 and the tractor rolls through the fields of green.

Well if it was any other man, I'd put him straight away
But when it's your brother sometimes you look the other way
Yeah me and Frankie laughin' and drinkin'
Nothin' feels better than blood on blood
Takin' turns dancin' with Maria as the band
Played ""Night of the Johnstown Flood""

Man turns his back on his family well he just ain't no good

32,The Shifting Whispering Sands,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/the-shifting-whispering-sands-chords-1067653,"       I discovered the valley of the shifting, whispering sands
I saw the silent windmills, the crumbling water tanks,
I stumbled over a crumbling buckboard nearly covered by the sand.
And suddenly realized that even though the wind was quiet,
The sand did not lie still.
So heavy and oppresive      I could scarcely breathe.
For weeks I wandered aimlessly       in the valley,
Seeking answers to the many questions that raced through my mind.
     The baron valley where the people must have lived and died?
And resting,        I learned the secret of the shifting, whispering sands.
But now to pay my debt for being saved, I must tell you
      (When the day is hardly quiet and the breeze seems not to blow,
One would think the sand was resting but you'll find this is not so.
It is whisp'ring, softly whisp'ring, as it slowly moves a-long.
And those who stop and listen, it will sing this mournful song.
Of side-winders and the horn toad on the thorny chaparral,
In the sunny days and the moonlight nights, the lonely coyotes yell.)
How the stars seem they could touch you as you lay and gaze on high
At the heavens where you're hoping you'll be going when you die.

He worked on farms, 'n he worked on cars

That grown men get when they need to cry

He said ""Every single day it gets
just a little bit harder to handle and yet...""

In exchange for the rent on a one room cell
And he's years old before his time
No thanks to the world, and the white Port wine
And he said ""Son"", he always called me son
He said, ""Life for you has just begun""
And then he told me the story that I heard before
How he fell in love with a Dallas whore
He could cut through the years to the very night
That it all ended, in a whore house fight
And she turned his last proposal down
In favor of being a girl about town
Now it's been seventeen years right in line
And he ain't been straight none of the time

And too many nights of not being together

Without these letters from home to carry me on
My life would fall to pieces
Every word that I read brings comfort to me
I love my letters from home
I love my letters from home

47,W Lee Odaniel And The Light Crust Dough Boys,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/w-lee-odaniel-and-the-light-crust-dough-boys-chords-4065970,"In the town of Tulsa, about thirty years ago
At King's Old Calloway, down in Old Oklahoma
Where the dust was blowing but the music was right
And Doug Lee O'Daniels played all night
For The Light Crust Dough Boys and Doug Lee O'Dan
We drove eighty miles through the blowing sand
My thirty-seven Chevy was shooting steam
Coming up the hills, just East of Pawnee
But I wouldn't miss a dance on a Saturday night
For all of them Chevys in the Detroit Line
I can hear that music in my ears
I'm ready to go and I'm shifting my gears
So, just pass me the biscuits and give me your hand
You know, you're my Honey and you know, I'm your man
Listen to that fiddler, making it sing
And hear the pretty hot mix of a guitar ring
Well, I got no trouble and I'm feeling no pain
Got all that good music, blowing in my veins
Let the Light Crust Dough Boys, and Old Pappy Dan
Play us a song that we'll never forget
Now they say, times are rough and that money is time
But I don't care on a Saturday night
I got no money but I can sing blues
When I feel like dancing, way down in my shoes
In the town of Tulsa, about thirty years ago
At King's Old Calloway, down in Old Oklahoma
Where the dust was blowing but the music was right
And Doug Lee O'Daniels played all night

I moved by and love refused to go
It seems like only yesterday or maybe just last summer
Most of all a year or so ago
Don't seem like we've been together all our lives
Don't seem like we've been settled down since we got out of school
Who'da thought we'd still love each other when twilight years arrived 
Don't seem like we've been together all our lives
She looked like me but still she favor you
I can't believe the years have already come and gone
Seems like everything we own is nearly new
Don't seem like we've been together all our lives
Don't seem like we've been settled down since we got out of school
Who'da thought we'd still love each other when twilight years arrived
Don't seem like we've been together all our lives

I want to stay around you
and so I beg you,
""Let it be me.""
Don't take this Heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
now and forever
let it be me.
Each time we meet, love
I find complete love.
Without your sweet love
what would life be?
So never leave me lonely
tell me you'll love me only
and let it only
let it be me.
Each time we meet, love
I find complete love.

So never leave me lonely

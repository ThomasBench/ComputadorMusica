My go-to compass and my golden rule
When life rings my southern bell
I just gotta ask myself, hell

In them heels
In that dress
Wouldn’t put up with no BS
She'd kill ya with some kindness, take the high road
Turn a little rain into a rainbow

I just gotta ask myself, hell

Didn’t let dirt poor hold her back
And getting told no, it don't mean jack
Ain't scared of nothing ain't nobody's fool
Don't put up with heartbreak boys like you

Save a little air for me
I don't need much

With a million lights just trying to get through a darkness
And find a way through
Guess I’ll lay down
And find a star that I can put your name on

I remember you sometimes let come undone

And it felt to me like heaven had opened the skies
A man so harsh and heavy letting love pour from his eyes
I saw your love beneath the pain
I saw you fight through every day
Oh, why couldn't I make you OK?
In a melody you were finally free
You'd forget the guilt and for a moment see me
These days I'm singing, searching all the eyes
For that same freedom I am too deprived

And now she drives that box truck fifty hours a week
But who's got the time?
And that taste she got of money sure was sweet
Oh, lately she's been wonderin'
Did she get real or did she just give up?
But she's not the type to whine
So she just follows those white lines and keeps her mouth shut
But when no one is around
She sneaks a little puff and that's enough
She's vapin' on the job
To spice it up and cool it down
Forget her pain, forget her place
Forget this game, forget this race
Forget this town
Forget the nightmares in the news
Forget these old computer blues
Forget the dreams she used to dream that she forgot
Oh, forget the boss, she's vapin' on the job
While Michelle drives the truck
Danny rides a desk chair up in midtown
One of those odd jobs that ain't really odd at all
While the higher-ups play ping-pong in the background
He can't remember when he ever felt this small
'Cause the screenplay that he wrote
Ain't causin' the commotion that he hoped
Seems like every day's the same old joke
But Danny's found a special way to cope
When he sneaks out to the stairs
And puts that pen up to his lips and gives it a kiss
He's vapin' on the job
To spice it up and cool it down
Forget his pain, forget his place
Forget this game, forget this race
Forget this town
Forget the nightmares in the news
Forget these old computer blues
Forget the dreams he used to dream that he forgot
Oh, forget the boss, he's vapin' on the job
Oh, Danny meets Michelle
At a bar in Queens where Deena is the barkeep
She pours them both a water and a beer
Says Danny as Michelle draws on her napkin
Deena fakes a smile and pretends to care
'Cause her spirit's on the bottom shelf
And in her heart, she's carryin' a stone
Since the person that she thought she'd maybe
Could've loved turned out to be a ghost
So she steps out for some air
But Danny and Michelle know where she's goin'
She's vapin' on the job
To spice it up and cool it down
Forget her pain, forget her place
Forget this game, forget this race
Forget this town
Forget the nightmares in the news
Forget these old computer blues

That when September comes, I'll make my move
I'll change my email and lose my phone
And let those Santa Ana winds just blow away
These old, old computer blues
That I've accrued
So I picked a U-Haul up in Queens
Packed up my things and bid my last adieus
But as I drove through New Jersey
Maybe winter's not a season, it's a state of being
That just being in a warmer state won't help me lose
And so I won't be movin' out to Los Angeles
This fall, after all
I got a mother that I just can't please
I got a lover that I can’t just leave
And I’ve signed along the dotted line and I turned in my keys
But I'm nowhere close to Los Angeles
So I’m driving back to New York
To the tune of ""California, here we come""
My cat curls up in the shotgun seat
That seems to say, ""Well, that was quite the stunt you pulled
You old, old son of a gun
Now have a think about what you've done""
Oh, wouldn't my life be so much better?
Wouldn't all my problems sorta disappear?
If I could find the courage now
And drag it all behind me into the sunset
Lighting up my rearview mirror
Perhaps another year
Oh no, I won’t be movin' out to Los Angeles
This fall, after all
I got a mother that I just can't please
I got a lover that I just can't leave
And I've signed along the dotted line and I turned in my keys

When the work began to pile

As the afternoon would fade into the evening
I should be high by now but I don't feel a thing

There's nothing they show me that I haven't seen
Feels like we've been here before, and it's no fun anymore
And it's too late to start over new
And though it's dark in this room
I see your face glowing blue
By the static of the TV screen
These drugs aren't working the way that they used to
The nothings we whisper in bed have gone stale
And I've been racking my brain to write a better refrain
Something romantic I might whisper to you
But I got nothing because it's like I told you
""These drugs aren't working the way that they used to""
Now, Victoria's a sorcerer, but she don't believe in magic anymore
Night after night, from town to town, she packs the clubs then tears 'em down
And leaves her heart still beating on the floor
""Oh, Dougie, what's the use?"" she says
""My love's a flood that never ends
And I fear I may be slowly disappearing""
I say, ""We lead such different lives
And it ain't exactly great advice
But if you want this song, it's yours to sing""

People kiss and tell, but it's all alright
'Cause by the weekend, we won't care at all
We're gonna be
Where everybody knows on a Friday
We meet up nine to one at the same place
We sing throwbacks on the jukebox
Whole bar buzzing with small town talk
Everybody knows what your drink is
People walk in like they're famous
And we all know we ain't nobody
But we all feel like somebody
Where everybody knows, everybody knows everybody
Everybody knows everybody
Everybody knows, everybody knows everybody
Everybody knows everybody
So if you wanna keep a little mystery
Shades on, hat down, low key
Coast right under that radar
You should roll right past this bar
Where everybody knows on a Friday
We meet up nine to one at the same place
We sing throwbacks on the jukebox
Whole bar buzzing with small town talk
Everybody knows what your drink is
People walk in like they're famous
And we all know we ain't nobody
But we all feel like somebody
Where everybody knows, everybody knows everybody
Everybody knows everybody
Everybody knows, everybody knows everybody
Everybody knows everybody

  Drinkin' Mezcal and tears in our eyes7
  You sang me a song sweet as a monsoon
  Blowin' in    from the South
  Hear the bells ringin' out

  I sat on the hill near the mission
  Where lovers meet and when poppies bloom
  I followed the ranchers rambling down Broadway
  Sellin' crops on the side of the road
  Their heart's in Sonora whenever it rains
And wherever they roam
  Take this charm and dry your tears
  Won't you wear it to ease your mind?
  Hear the bells ringin' out
  Let 'em ring on New Year's Day
  Hear the radio blarin' a sad corrido
  ""La tierra del sol suspiro por verte
  Quisiera llorar, quisiera morrir""
Come this November's Procession
Mezcal on a Sunday with tears in our eyes
  'Cause it's foolish to laugh and pointless to cry
  About some old photos buried inside the cracked and crumblin' walls
  Take this charm and dry your tears

  Take a breath to soothe your sorrows
  Until they're gone, gone as the years fade away

""Trust in the lord, man, he''ll take you to the promised land,""
As he shakes the bible in his hand.
Mr. Johnny's got his tent and he's got his fans
Fancy cars in the driveway and the people say ""Look at this.""
They don't know his ignorance is bliss.
Screaming ""love thy neighbor"" as he laughs at midgets on TV,
Thumbing the cross around his neck and trying sobriety.
He looks so peculiar through his specs, 'cause he still can't see.
Is it clear to anyone but me? Is he kidding anyone but me?
Mr. Johnny knows not much and he knows it well.
Two types if people, those to heaven and those to hell.
He takes a drag but he doesn't inhale.
Somewhere down that long tough and winding path
Mr Johnny's golden rule turn the water green crimson black
His fundamentals are a thing of the past
Teaching the children all the virtues of equality
Boy tuck your shirt tail in, no room for minorities
He looks so peculiar through his specs cause he still can't see
Is he kidding anyone but me? Is it clear to anyone but me?

Through this strange cacophony he hears the trumpet sound
And then he smiles as his feet leave the ground

looks so peculiar through his specs because he still can't see

And our lives, they were divided by the railroad tracks
But we'd meet up every mornin' at that riverbend
That's where I learned about Jesus from my only black friend
And sometimes we'd sit and stare up at the sky
And I could see the hope of heaven in his eyes
  In the land where the cotton grows
  In a time when change came slow
  Just beyond    the point of no return
  A white boy and a black old man
  On the tracks walking hand in hand
  It's where I come to  understand and learn
  Where the cross don't burn
He'd Tell me  money doens't matter, nor the color of your skin
You can stumble, even fall and still   get up again
'Cause it ain't about the deeds, good or bad that we have done
All we have to do is love to be disciples of the Son
And we'd   join hands and bow our heads to   pray
And he told me that he loved me every   day

That you won't feel that way
You're still gonna be my baby
Even when you're my age
When you have kids someday
I hope you teach them the Lord's prayer
Before they go to bed at night
Like my daddy for me and his mother did for him
Well something about it just keeps you right
And I hope you don't work too much overtime
So you can be right there beside them
When they close their little eyes
'Cause they'll outgrow their shoes
They'll outgrow their beds
They'll outgrow that house
And you can't stop it
Life will line your face
Time will turn the page
But they're still gonna be your babies
Just like you're still gonna be my baby
Even when you're my age
Even when you're my age

I don't tell 'em 'bout the night you left
I don't show 'em these texts I saved
All the games you played
They don't know nothing 'bout it
Whenever somebody says your name
I don't break, I just say
It's for the best, it's over now
Wasn't anyone's fault, it didn't work out
She's a good girl, just wasn't the one
We wanted different things, we had a good run
She's better off, and so am I
It is what it is, yeah, it's alright
I don't tell 'em how you broke my heart
I just tell 'em that we grew apart
I could tell 'em how you came in late
I could tell 'em how you looked me in the eye
And told that lie with a straight face
I don't know why I don't, but maybe I hope
It ain't really over
But what's that say about me?
Am I that weak?
'Cause I just keep saying
It's for the best, it's over now
Wasn't anyone's fault, it didn't work out
She's a good girl, just wasn't the one
We wanted different things, we had a good run
She's better off, and so am I
It is what it is, yeah, it's alright
I don't tell 'em how you broke my heart
I just tell 'em that we grew apart
I don't drag your name through the mud
Baby, we both know I could
Maybe I should, yeah
It's for the best, it's over now
Wasn't anyone's fault, it didn't work out
She's a good girl, just wasn't the one
We wanted different things, we had a good run
She's better off, and so am I
It is what it is, But it's all a lie
I don't tell 'em how you broke my heart
I just tell 'em that we grew apart
I just tell 'em that we grew apart
Yeah we grew apart

1,The Balladeer,Lori McKenna,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lori-mckenna/the-balladeer-chords-3327665,"The balladeer waits in the wings,
Tugging on her dress, tuning her strings.
All her whiskey faded cigarette blown dreams,
She brings herself to her own knees,
with every line so delicate.
She sings every song that she knows.
The way that she hears 'em, sad and slow.
They're never gonna play her on the radio.
So she hangs in the darkest bars
with downtrodden bleeding hearts.
A guitar man there who knew all the chords.
Said he needed her to help him find the words.
The balladeer never loved anybody more.
It was magic but she worried,
what if she ran out of the pain...
She carried round with her, so proud.
She wore it like a queen wears a crown.
She didn't know who she'd be if she put it down.
So he brought her to the river
where she could wash the trouble...
From her heart and let it shine like gold.
Felt like angels pouring mercy on her soul.
And the weight of the world, she let it go.
And she sang for the first time
with her head held high and so much pride.
It opened up new notes in her throat.
There was joy in every new song she wrote.
They got a bus and traveled coast to coast.
Drinking with their friends and strangers
and business people called to say.
That she was finally headed for the stars,
Or at least the top of the charts.
They changed her clothes and bought fancy cars.
Till the guitar man caught the eye
of a pretty background singer with the bluuuuuuessss...
Oh, oh, oh...
The guitar man cried 'cause he done her wrong.
The background singer took the next flight home.
And the balladeer wrote herself a song,
About brokenhearted dreamers who are searching
for something they'll never fiiiiiiinnnnd........
mmm, mmm...

If you took a drink, you might reconsider
If I was a church, I'd be hanging with the sinners
Talking 'bout Hendrix and Heaven
If I was a bar, I'd be a dive
A free jukebox in a double-wide
Neon lights saying ""Come inside""
And I'd be ""Open 24/7""

The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
The way an evening breeze may tease a candle flame
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned
I always built to last on weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
And only now I see how the years have run away
Yesterday, when I was young
So many happy songs were waiting to be sung
So many wild pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think what life was all about
Every conversation that I can now recall
Concerned itself with me, and nothing else at all
Yesterday, the moon was blue
And every crazy day brought something new to do
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died
The friends I made all seemed, somehow, to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
The time has come for me to pay for yesterday

Cuttin' rug on a bar room floor

Sunrise to bed, they kept us fed and the lights on most the time
Some out of joint rips on the laces, scuffed up, scarred from heel to toe

And her voice was sad and soft in her throat
As she bid me last farewell

I stopped for just a minute, to see a friend outside of town
Put my collar up, I found his name, and felt the wind die down
Then a drunk man in a cowboy hat took me by surprise
Wearing shiny boots, a Nudie suit, and haunting haunted eyes
He said ""friend it's good to see you, it's nice to know you care""
Then the wind picked up and he was gone, or was he ever really there?
'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whip-poor-will
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill
'Cause when the wind is right you'll hear his songs
Smell whiskey in the air
Midnight in Montgomery
He's always singing there
So I climbed back on that Eagle, took one last look around
Through red tail lights, a shadow moved, slowly 'cross the ground
And off somewhere a midnight train is slowly passing by
I can hear that whistle moan, I'm so lonesome I could cry
'Cause it's midnight in Montgomery
Just hear that whip-poor-will
See the stars light up the purple sky
Feel that lonesome chill

Save it for me
When the world falls apart I can say with certainty
There's a reason
A light left on in an empty room
Is how a love can be
Is all a love can be
Is all a love can be
Is all a love can be

37,Fancy,Orville Peck,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/orville-peck/fancy-chords-3498842,"I remember it all very well looking back
Was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one room, worn-out shack on the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent, to say the least we was hard-pressed
And mama spent every last penny we had to buy me a dancin' dress
Mama washed and combed and curled my hair and she painted my eyes and lips
Stepped into a satin dancin' dress that had a slit in the side clean up to my hips
It was red velvet trimming and it fit me good
Staring back from the looking glass, there stood a woman where a half-grown boy had stood
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck and she kissed my cheek
I could see the tears welling up in her troubled eyes as she started to speak
She looked at our pitiful shack, and then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said your Pa's run off and I'm real sick and the baby's gonna starve to death
She handed me a heart-shaped locket that said, ""To thine own self be true""
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across the toe of my high-heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talking, asking, ""Mama what do I do?""
She said, ""Just be nice to the gentleman, Fancy, they'll be nice to you""
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do, but if you want out, well, it's up to you
Don't let me down now, your mama's gonna move you uptown
That was the last time I saw my Ma, the night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby, mama died and I ain't been back
But the wheels of fate had started to turn and for me there was no way out
It wasn't very long till I knew exactly what my mama'd been talking about
I knew what I had to do but I made myself this solemn vow
Said I was gonna be a lady someday, though it didn't matter when or how
I couldn't see spending the rest of my life with my head held down in shame
You know, I might've been born just plain white trash but Fancy was my name
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
It wasn't long after a benevolent man took me in off the street
One week later I was pouring his tea in a five-room hotel suite
I charmed a king, a congressman, and the occasional aristocrat
I got me a Georgia mansion and an elegant New York townhouse flat and I ain't done bad
Now in this life there's a lot of self-righteous hypocrites that call me bad
And criticize mama for turning me out, no matter how little we had
And though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin' for now on fifteen years
I can still hear the desperation in my poor mama's voice ringing in my ears
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Here's your one chance, Fancy, don't let me down
Lord, forgive me for what I do, but if you want out, well, it's up to you
Don't let me down now, your mama's gonna move you Uptown

Yeah, you should've known better, should've known bеtter
Than to break what you couldn't fix
Boy, what a shame what you'rе gonna miss
Why'd you go and do what you can't take back?
Yeah, you should've known better, should've known better than that
  Oh, oh, you should've known better than that

48,Gutted,Bella White,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bella-white/gutted-chords-3552506,"I was gutted, oh I felt soft
So I took to drinking with the hopes of getting lost
When you're always losing    it's hard to see your wins
When I start using and I'm numb again
I been high ballin' through a playground zone
Oh I know there's nothing, oh nothing left for me there no more
At night I take to walking down lonely dead end roads
With the hopes that one might catch me, oh God knows I won't
I often think I could hop on a plane and it all would go away
But I'd be a fool to think my burdens are something I don't carry
for I can't leave 'em at the gates with the rest of my worries
You might not see me for a while before I've gone in a hurry
You might not see me for a while before I've gone in a hurry
My name is something that my parents gave to me
Lately I dissassociate when it's hollared out at me
I've been tangled up in the dichotomy
And in the notion of the disbelief, that what will be will be
I often think I could hop on a plane and it all would go away
But I'd be a fool to think my burdens are something I don't carry
for I can't leave 'em at the gates with the rest of my worries
You might not see me for a while before I've gone in a hurry
You might not see me for a while before I've gone in a hurry

Can't get out of my own mind
But I know how to sing about it
Ring of bone, a little lonely
I better hit the road, child
We can cry into the phone a while
Jubilee, find me
Steady with your hope now
That little light's gotta last a while
Like an arrow, to the marrow
I know it feels like hell now
Til we make it to the other side
You want good news
You want sanctuary
But when you try to get real
They break you on the wheel
You wanna move
You want sanctuary
That's all that I can offer to ya
From the bottom to the bone
To the bone
Get used to thе bad news
It's all part of the show, child
Handsome Johnny had to go, child
What did you feel, brothеr? Bad dreams?
Oh, there's something you should know now
Little things that'll cut you down
Ragged people, hard times
And the lightning strikes the poorhouse
The rich man cries like a crocodile
Salvation, despair
But the game that they taught me
Sometimes it feels like it just ain't fair
You want good news
You want sanctuary
But when you try to get real
They break you on the wheel
You wanna move
You want sanctuary
That's all that I can offer to ya
From the bottom to the bone
To the bone
Yeah, to the bone
Oh, to the bone
Yeah, to the bone
Ah, to the bone
Yeah, to the bone
Oh, to the bone
Feeling bad, feeling blue
Can't get out of my own mind
But I know how to sing about it

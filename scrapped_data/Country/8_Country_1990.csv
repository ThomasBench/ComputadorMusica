Holding Jim, loving him.
Sue came along and loved me strong that's what I thought,
Me and Sue, that died too.
Don't know if I will but until I can find me,
A girl who will stay and won't play games behind me.
I'll be what I am.
A Solitary man, solitary man.
I had it to here being where love is a small word,
Paper ring, part time thing.
I know it's been done having one girl who loves you,
Right or wrong, weak or strong.
Don't know if I will but until I can find me,
A girl who will stay and won't play games behind me.
I'll be what I am.

I'm not as pretty as I was
I've kicked myself at times because I've lied
So I will have to learn to stand my ground
I'll tell them I won't be around
I'll move on over to your town and hide
And you be the captain
And I'll be no one
And you can carry me away if you want to
And you can lay low
Just like your father
And if I tread upon your feet you just say so
Cause you're the captain, I am no one
I tend to feel as though I owe one to you
To you
Well, I have handed all my efforts in
I've searched here for my second wind
Is there somewhere here to let me in I ask
So I slammed the doors they slammed at me
I found the place I'm meant to be
I figured out my destiny at last
And you be the captain
And I'll be no one
And you can carry me away if you want to
And you can lay low
Just like your father
And if I tread upon your feet you just say so
Cause you're the captain, I am no one
I tend to feel as though I owe one to you
To you
 Did I forget to thank you for the ride
I hadn't tried, I tend to run away and hide
And you be the captain
And I'll be no one
And you can carry me away if you want to
And you can lay low
Just like your father

I just sat there on the living room couch  staring off into space

They took the sheets off of the bed  and they went to call someone
Some of us gathered at a friend's house to help each other ease the
I just sat alone in a corner chair  I couldn't say much of anything
We drove on out to the country
His friends all stood around
Subiaco Cemetery is where we lay him down
I saw his mama, she was standing there  his sister she was there too
I saw them look at us standing around the grave and not a soul they
Born and raised in Pineola  his mama believed in the Pentecost
She got the preacher to say some words so his soul wouldn't get lost

I may never see again
She hit me with a left and right
Showin' me nothin' but the taillights

Now if I even make it back to town before the sun comes up
I'm gonna hit every parking spot around

Just a little more every day I'm tempted

Just one look and you'll know why I'm tempted

Have you ever rented a room?
Have you even ever rented a room?
       An anchor lets you see the river move
Now that your evil dreams came true
         There on your face
A row of teeth will come to replace
I know you laughed
When I left
But you really only hurt yourself
You see your curtains move in the wind
You can bet I'm betting against you again
Cause I'm a man who has a wife who has a mother
Who married one but she loved another
You're a tower without the bells
You're a negative wishing well
        Should have checked the stable      door
For the name of the sire and dame
     You were always at the dog track
With your brother and all his friends
    Chalk lines around my body
Like the shore line of a lake
Your laughter made me nervous
It made your body shake too hard
Now there's a lot of things that I'm gonna miss
Like thunder down country and the way water drips
When you're running for the door in the rain
Read the metro section
Read the metro section
Read the metro section
See my name

Tempers that are shattered and thin

I'm not ready yet
'Til I       am myself
'Til I       am myself
'Til I       am myself again
I had a dream that my house was on fire
People laughed while it burned, well
I tried to run but my legs were numb
I had to wait til the feeling returned
I don't need a doctor to figure it out
I know what's passing me by
When I look in the mirror
Sometimes I see traces of some other guy, well
I want to go
I know  I can't stay
But I don't want to run
Feeling this way
'Til I       am myself
'Til I       am myself
'Til I       am myself again

47,Whenever You Come Around (ver 2),Vince Gill,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/vince-gill/whenever-you-come-around-chords-1750854,"The face of an angel, pretty eyes that shine
I lie awake at night wishing you were mine
I'm standing here holding the biggest heartache in town
Whenever you come around
I get weak in the knees, and I lose my breath
Oh I try to speak but the words won't come
I'm so scared to death
And when you smile that smile the world turns upside down
Whenever you come around
I feel so helpless, I feel just like a kid
What is it about you that keep my feelings hid
I wish I could tell you, but the words can't be found
Whenever you come around
I get weak in the knees, and I lose my breath
Oh I try to speak but the words won't come
I'm so scared to death
And when you smile that smile the world turns upside down
Whenever you come around
I get weak in the knees, and I lose my breath
Oh I try to speak but the words won't come
I'm so scared to death
And when you smile that smile the world turns upside down
Whenever you come around
And when you smile that smile the world turns upside down
Whenever you come around
Whenever you come around

I want a comfortable bed that won't hurt my back
Food to fill me up  and warm clothes and all that stuff
Shouldn't I have this   Shouldn't I have this
Shouldn't I have all of this, and  Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses, whoa oh  Passionate kisses from you
Is it too much to demand
I want a full house and a rock and roll band
Pens that won't run out of ink  And cool quiet and time to think
Shouldn't I have this   Shouldn't I have this
Shouldn't I have all of this, and  Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses, whoa oh  Passionate kisses from you
Do I want too much Am I going overboard to want that touch
I shout it out to the night
Give me what I deserve, 'cause it's my right
Shouldn't I have this   Shouldn't I have this
Shouldn't I have all of this, and  Passionate kisses
Passionate kisses, whoa oh  Passionate kisses from you
Passionate kisses Passionate kisses, whoa oh
Passionate kisses from you

And I like to sleep late on Sunday
And nobody knows me like my baby
And I like eggs over easy
With flour tortillas
And nobody knows me like my baby
And nobody holds me
And nobody knows me
Nobody knows me like my baby
But it was a dream made to order
South of the border
And nobody knows me like my baby
And she cried man how could you do it
And I swore that there weren't nothing to it
But nobody knows me like my baby
And nobody holds me
And nobody knows me
Nobody knows me like my baby
And I like cream in my coffee
And I hate to be alone on Sunday
And nobody knows me like my baby

Addressed to the Master and these words he spoke
Straight up into heaven this letter did go

Lays the mighty wonder, nature made
A hundred miles of jade, the mighty Ever-glades
It's beautiful at sunset, but oh' there's something else
That makes the bravest heart, a-fraid
A world of things a-crawlin', a-thumpin' and a-bawlin'
And wadin' in the Ever-glades
Creepin', seepin'
I hear a million things a-weepin'
As I gaze, into the weirdness
Of the mighty, Ever-glades
Over and over
I call, oh please come back my lover
But my love is dead, or wandrin'
In the fearful,  Ever-glades
Voices (voices) callin' (callin'), shadows (shadows) fallin' (fallin')
Spirits (spirits) of those (those), who ventured in and stayed
Hear it, fear it,   never, never go too near it

Slidin', (slidin') hidin' (hidin'), my love, in the Ever-glades
Over (over) and over (over), I call but now she's gone for ever

42,The Letter Edged In Black,Jim Reeves,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jim-reeves/the-letter-edged-in-black-chords-3856961,"I was standin' by my window yesterday morning
Without a thought of sorrow or of care
When I saw the postman coming up the pathway
With such a smiling face and jolly air
He rang the bell and whistled as he waited
And then he said; ""Good morning to you Jack""
But he little knew the sorrow that he brought me
When he handed me a letter edged in black
With trembling hands I took the letter from him
I open it and this is what it said..
""Come home my boy, your dear old daddy wants you
Come home my boy, your dear ole,  mother's dead""
""The last words your mother ever uttered
For tell my boy I want him to come back
My eyes are blurred, my poor old heart is breaking
As, I'm writing you, this letter edged in black""
""Those angry words I wish I'd never spoken
You know I didn't mean them, don't you Jack
May the angels bear me witness, I am asking
Your forgiveness in this letter edged in black""

In a room so lonely and cheerless, sits a woman all alone
By her a cradle, stands empty and o'er it, she sobs and she moans
My husband, he no longer loves me, his love and our dear baby died
I'll leave him at home forever and 'thout him, this ole world abide
She packed baby's things in a bundle, while the tears rolled down her cheeks
I never, no never, would leave him, if ever a kind word, he'd speak
Just then, the door softly was opened, a man took the bundle away
He layed the things out on the table and softly to her, he did say
One little stockin' for you dear, one little blue shoe is for me
The baby's wrap and its smallest cap, we'll keep in memory
One lock of hair is for you dear, see how the golden curl shines
We'll keep a smile, while she sleeps for, she is the tie, that binds

Is another bend I can't see
And the bend   that keeps calling
Is the bend that keeps hiding from me
Past the first hill on the desert
Is another hill I can't see
And the hill   that keeps hiding
Is the hill that keeps calling to me
In the cottonwood by the river
A mourning dove calls his mate
He has true love to give her
But love for me must wait
Till I've traveled every river
And each desert hill I have climbed
If I find love to my liking
I'll leave the river's bend far behind...

I told my heart to forget her-
Her little game is well known.
I told my heart, its best that we part,
But my heart has a mind of its own.
How foolish to think I could rule it?
How silly to even begin?
If I win, if I lose, or if I sing the blues-
I must play the game to the end.
I told my heart to be careful-
Don't swim with the waters too deep.
It won't pay attention, to things that I mention,
To the danger I've had its asleep.
Too late to turn back, it's all over-
Gone is the love I had known.
I got lost in the rush, but I've still got a crush,
Cause my heart, has a mind, of its own!

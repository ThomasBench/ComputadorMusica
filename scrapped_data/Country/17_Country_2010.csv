0,A Woman Like You (ver 3),Lee Brice,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lee-brice/a-woman-like-you-chords-1162308,"Last night out of the blue
Driftin' off to the evenin' news
She said ""Honey, what would you do
""If you'd have never met me""
I just laughed, said ""I don't know,
""But I could take a couple guesses though""
And then tried to dig real deep,
Said, ""Darlin', honestly
I'd do a lot more offshore fishin'
Probably eat more drive-thru chicken
Take a few strokes off my golf game
If I'd a never known your name
I'd still be drivin' that old green 'Nova
I probably never would have heard of yoga
Be a better football fan
But if I was a single man
Alone and out there on the loose
I'd be lookin' for a woman like you""
Well, I could tell that got her attention
So I said, ""Oh yeah, I forgot to mention
I wouldn't trade a single day
For a hundred years the other way
She just smiled and rolled her eyes
'Cause she's heard all of my lines
I said, ""C'mon on girl, seriously
If I hadn't been so lucky
I'd be shootin' pool in my bachelor pad
Playin' bass in my cover band
Restockin' up cold Bud Light
For poker every Tuesday night, yeah
I'd have a dirtbike in the shed
And not one throw pillow on the bed
I'd keep cash in a coffee can
But if I was a single man
Alone and out there on the loose
I'd be looking for a woman like you""
She knows what a mess I'd be if I didn't have her here
But to be sure,         I whispered in her ear
You know I get sick deep-sea fishin'
And you make the best fried chicken
I got a hopeless golf game
I love the sound of your name
I might miss that old green 'Nova
But I love watchin' you do yoga
I'd take a gold band on my hand
Over bein' a single man
'Cause honestly, I don't know what I'd do
If I'd never met a woman like you

One's for queens, and one's for fools

One's forever, and one won't last

I guess some things just don't mix like you hope
Like me and you

Never meant to hurt no one
But some flames are hard to simmer
I wore my pride on my bad side 
and on the other kept my hand close by the trigger
Some folks are guided by the weight of their tongues 
But we all fall silent at the end of a gun, And now I’m 
Just a lonesome ol’ rounder
With a number for my name and a rope to haunt my dreams
They’re gonna hang me boys from a tall, tall tree
Those demons, they’ll be the death of me
Some folks are guided by some light of the Lord
But me I was blinded and I’ll never afford my salvation
I’m just a lonesome ol’ rounder
Darkness grows, and then it’s gone
And at the end of this lonely road
Those deeds you’ve done they say you’ll never go home
Some folks are guided by the love they share
But darkness called and left me unaware
Now I’m just a lonesome ol’ rounder 
With a few last words and one last meal
They’re gonna hang me, boys, come the morning light
When darkness smiles and all is still
All is still

Born on the banks of the Shenandoah.
In '61, I went to the war,
To win one for Virginia!
Ya my brother went first and they called me too.
I was green as clover in the morning dew.
So I marched to the drum and I sang to the tune.
Carry me back to Virginia!
Fire in the cannon, water in the well,
Raced through the valley with a rebel yell.
I learned right quick how to march like hell and affix that bayonet.
Wont ya carry me back?
Wont ya carry me back?
Carry me back to Virginia.
With a sword and a saddle, Powder in the gun.
We thought for a minute our fight was done.
So they lined us up to the metals arm,
And hammered us into the quicksand.
Then they burned that valley in a blaze of fire,
Cut through the lands like a red hot iron.
Til the men took cover where the horses piled,
Then we shivered and then hold against them.
But the war raged on like flames of hell,
We dug through the pockets of the ones who fell,
Dressed in rags and we ate that grass
When they cut off our legs we cried!
Wont ya carry me back?
Wont ya carry me back?
Carry me back to Virginia.  (repeat chorus)
And they died in the valley, Died in the swamp,
On the banks of the river where the whitetail jumped.
Died in the ditches, Died in the fields,
In the belly of a wagon for a womans to heal
Died in the war, Starved in the camps.
Locked in the prisons of a meaner man.
Spilled our blood in the fight to defend
And to bury the tome of a-dixieland!
Down in Alabama, down in Caroline,
Way down in Gerogie, on the Tennesee line.
We fought for the rebels, and Robert E. Lee,
Now we want to go home to Virginia.
Say we want to go home to Virginia!
Wont ya carry me back?
Wont ya carry me back?
Carry me back to Virginia.
Wont ya carry me back?
Wont ya carry me back?
I wanna be buried in Virginia!

And your path is free to walk,
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag,
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch.
And it's knowing I'm not shackled,
By forgotten words and bonds,
And the ink stains that are dried up on some line,
That keeps you in the back roads,
By the rivers of my memory,
And keeps you ever gentle on my mind.
It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy,
Planted on their columns now that bind me,
Or something that somebody said,
Because they thought we fit, together walking.
It's just knowing that the world,
Will not be cursing or forgiving,
When I walk along some railroad track and find,
That you're moving on the back roads,
By the rivers of my memory,
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind.
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines,
And the junkyards and the highways come between us,
And some other woman's crying to her mother,
Cause she turned and you were gone.
I still might run in silence,
Tears of joy might stain my face,
And the summer sun might burn me until I'm blind,
But not to where I cannot see.
You walking on the back roads.
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind.
You dip your cup of soup, back from a gurgling,
Crackling cauldron, in some train yard,
Your beard a roughening coal pile,
And a dirty hat pulled low across your face.
Through cupped hands 'round the tin can,
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find,
That you're waiting from the back roads,
By the rivers of my memories,
Ever smiling, ever gentle on my mind.

Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon

Drip of honey on the money make it gotta be,
The best buzz i'm ever gonna find

What gives 'em a right to wear a pair of beat-up boots?
Is it the size of your tires and your fires, or your wild ass buddies?
Well, give me a minute, let me hit you with some hometown truth
You could be a cowboy on the Texas plain
Or a plowboy waitin' on the rain
I got my dirt road cred when I was 12
On a no-cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb-lines
Running bird dogs through the Georgia pines
Step side covered down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight'n, that was us
It might not've been you, but I ain't judging
Just be proud of what makes you country
Does it run in your blood?
Did it come from your daddy and mama?
Were you converted by an Alabama song on the radio?
Did you lock eyes with a little green-eyed girl from Jackson?
Tell me what got ya, I just gotta know
Me, I got my Sunday learning in a live oak church
Silver Queen corn in the backyard dirt
Waiting for the fall to finally come along
So I can grab my gun and get my outside on
Step side covered down in peanut dust
Friday night spotlight'n, that was us
It might not've been you, but I ain't judging
Just be proud of what makes you country
Might be from a city or a little farm town
Whatever kind of square that you drove around
Do you wear it on your sleeve or keep it deep down?
I got my dirt road cred back when I was 12
On a no-cab tractor hauling them bales
Backing in boats, fishing limb-lines
Running bird dogs through the Georgia pines
Step side covered down in peanut dust

Man, that was country
And that's the way country still out to be
It was lived, not taught, it was earned not bought
Had to put in the work to get to the top
Let me tell you, what I thinks really gone wrong
These days its all wannabes singing someone else's songs
Everybody's doing the same damn thing
Where have the rebels gone?
Cause we don't need
Another pretty boy, singing pretty songs
Fake country boys, doing country all wrong
We need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewing tobacco, and whipping ass
I need preacher, I need a savior
How about y'all?
Can I get an outlaw?
It don't have to be honkytonks, boots, and wrangler jeans
It ain't the banjo or the fiddle, no
It's the words and what they mean
If you gonna talk the talk, you better walk the walk
And brother that's the truth
So honestly, what would Waylon do?
I can guarantee that if he was alive today
He'd ask us one more time:
""Are you sure Hank done it this way?""
Cause we don't need
Another pretty boy, singing pretty songs
Fake country boys, doing country all wrong
We need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewing tobacco, and whipping ass
I need preacher, I need a savior
How about y'all?
Can I get an outlaw?
Are the good times really gone for good?
Or can we get back to our roots?
It's about that time we raise the bar
So raise a glass if you feel like I do
Cause we don't need
Another pretty boy, singing pretty songs
Fake country boys, doing country all wrong
We need another Haggard, or a Johnny Cash
Somebody chewing tobacco, and whipping ass
I need preacher, I need a savior
How about y'all?
I pray country answers my call

She's either a bachelorette or coming off a breakup
Take a drunk girl home
She's bouncing like a pinball
Dancing with her eyes closed like she's the only one in the room
But her hair is a perfect mess, falling out of that dress
Take a drunk girl home
Take a drunk girl home
Let her sleep all alone
Leave her keys on the counter, your number by the phone
Pick up her life she threw on the floor
Leave the hall lights on, walk out and lock the door

Take a drunk girl home
You leave her drive for a dive and you get something bad to eat
They're singing ""Closing Time"" at that little bar across the street
In two by twos, strangers and lovers headed for the covers, hooking up
That TV in your two bedroom sounds turned off
And through the paper-thin walls, you can hear the neighbors cigarette cough
There's a million things you could be doing, but there's one thing you're damn sure glad you did
Take a drunk girl home

And I would've been so  happy
Christmas lights glisten 
I've got my eye on the door 
Just waiting for you to walk in

People ask me how I've been, as I 
Comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be  here 
You said you'd, be  here
And it was like slow motion 
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing 
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
And the hours pass by,
Now I just want to be alone,
But your close friends always seem to know 
When there's something really wrong 
So they follow me down the hall 
And there in the bathroom 
I try not to fall apart 
And the sinking feeling starts 
As I say hopelessly ""He said he'd   be here""

Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress 
And they're all laughing 
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing

Streaming down your face in front of
Everyone you know?
And what do you do 
When the one who means the most to you 
Is the one who didn't show?
You should've been here, 
And I would've been so  happy
And it was like slow motion 
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all sitting around me singing 
""Happy Birthday To You""
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh, ohh, ohh, ohh, I knew

and people always wave goodbye   and say hello
And the maples on this road  they must be 300 years old
just imagine all the story's they could tell
of the tractors and the cars all coming home from Listons bar
and the country folk just out to raise some hell  to raise some hell
This is my home  This is where i belong  Where my daughters go to school
Where opinions are strong   Where my neighbors are my friends         
And the story never ends
So i just hit the ground and keep on running 
All of yesterday has come & gone
So you try to pickup all the pieces Put it all back the way it belongs
Well the next thing that you know   Its time to play another show
I'm leaving out of here just after dawn
Ain't it good to know that no matter where you go
That this town has got your back  
When you are gone    When you are gone
This is my home   this is where i belong     where my daughters go to school
Where opinions are strong   where my amendment rights
Keep me safe at night      where my neighbors are my friends

You're my world, the shelter from the rain
You're the pills, that take away my pain
You're the light, that helps me find my way
You're the words, when I have nothing to say
In this world where nothing else is true
Here I am still tangled up in you
I'm still tangled up in you
Still tangled up in you
You're the fire, that warms me when I'm cold
You're the hand I have to hold as I grow old
You're the shore, when I am lost at the sea
You're the only thing that I like about me
And in this world where nothing else is true
Here I am still tangled up in you
I'm still tangled up in you
How long has it been, since this storyline began
And I hope it never ends, and goes like this forever
In this world where nothing else is true
Here I am, still tangled up in you

to beat a single time, in time or out
Some may make it out alright and some may have never known
but these old wheels spin far too loud, far too loud
For I love to hear a chorus from the morning bird choir
and the sounds of coffee boiling on the pot
How I love to hear I love you in a dry morning tone
And just assume that if I can’t these wheels would stop
Yes happy is the day I lay my poor head down
with neither trial nor trouble to compete
with the chirp of summer crickets nor a tree frog’s croak
And these old wheels slow down enough so that I may sleep

It’s not the muscles or the size of your car
It’s not the everlasting hope of finding purpose or knowing who we are
It starts with realizing that death is just one moment
And in the end, those two are all we really score
But I’ve heard that you and me and the devil makes three
So, hello
Is it me you’re looking for
And I never walked the line because I’ve always rather shoved it in my nose
And I drink therefore I am, at least I think that’s how the saying goes
It doesn’t matter what you’ve heard, if you’re good or bad or everything in between
If you have a lot of money, if you’re funny or if you’re fifty shades of mean
If you’re studied in the good book, or you couldn’t give a damn,
Or you’d rather watch the movie, that’s fine
Because there’s one kind of people in this world
People who die.
Some people follow rules
Some people go around
There’s always gonna be a better high
And lower down
There’s always gonna be the person at the show
Who paid to watch the whole thing on their phone
And the only thing I know about that life I’m not about
This life is a maze with only one way out
But like a Catholic girl who turns the other cheek to keep the virgin in her name
Or marrying for money, goes to show, where there’s a will, there’s a way
It doesn’t matter what you’ve learned or if you’ve ever been concerned about mistakes
All the bridges in the world won’t lead you back to fix what couldn’t be erased
If you’re haggard with merl when Katy Perry kissed a girl
Or you buy your shit at REI
There’s only one kind of people in this world
People who die
People who die, die, die
People who die
People who die, die, die
People who die
People who, die. People who die.
People who diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiie *coughing*

shows two roads, honey
Tell me which one leads to mine?
Sing, little sister
Be patient with me when I don't have a rhyme
Will you grieve me, honey?
Did I give you a reason to try?

Turn that boat dock into a bar
And then we   passed the guitar around the fire to each other
And watched all of our friends pair off with one another
  But we fell like the stars we were under
And everybody knew that that was our summer
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
  Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Whoa
We set July on fire
Whoa
Yeah, girl, you and I were
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Moonlight, all night, crashing into me
  Nothing will ever be easy as you and me
Tangled up with nowhere to be
Just sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat, yeah
Whoa
We set July on fire
Whoa
Yeah, girl, you and I were
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat
Sunrise, sunburn, sunset, repeat

Two hands in the air, I’m a champion
You’ll be looking up at me when it’s over
I live for the battle, I’m a soldier, yeah
I’m a fighter like Rocky
Put you flat on your back like Ali
Yeah, I’m the greatest, I’m stronger
Paid my dues, can’t lose, I'm own ya, ay
I’ve been working my whole life
And now it’s do or die
I am invincible, unbreakable
Unstoppable, unshakeable
They knock me down, I get up again
I am the champion, you’re gon’ know my name
You can’t hurt me now, I can’t feel the pain
I was made for this, yeah, I was born to win
I am the champion
When they write my story
They gonna say that I did it for the glory
But don’t think that I did it for the fame, yeah
I did it for the love of the game, yeah
And this is my chance I’m taking
All them old records, I’m breaking
All you people watching on the TV
You go ahead and put your bets on me, ay
I’ve been waiting my whole life
To see my name in lights
I am invincible, unbreakable
Unstoppable, unshakeable
They knock me down, I get up again
I am the champion, you’re gon’ know my name
You can’t hurt me now, I can’t feel the pain
I was made for this, yeah, I was born to win
I am the champion
The C is for the courage I possess through the trauma
H is for the hurt, but it’s all for the honor
A is for my attitude working through the patience
Money comes and goes, so the M is for motivation
Gotta stay consistent, the P is for persevere
The I is for integrity, innovative career
The O is optimistic, open and never shut
And the N is necessary 'cause I’m never givin’ up
See, they ask me how I did it, I just did it from the heart
Crushin' the competition, been doing it from the start
They say that every champion is all about his principles
Carrie

I'm just not that kind of girl
I think I'm square cause you've been around
And you're wise in the ways of the world
All easy come easy go
You pulled me close and whispered now darling
There's something I want you to know
I still believe in waltzes and girls with old fashioned ways
I still believe in love songs and the good in the good ole days
I've always liked happy endings somebody’s dream coming true
I still believe in waltzes and dancing the last one with you
I'm worried you're working so late
It's just your job that keeps you away
Lord I know the temptations are great
Not too exciting I know
He pulled me close and whispered those same words
He told me that night long ago
I still believe in waltzes and girls with old fashioned ways
I still believe in love songs and the good in the good ole days
I've always liked happy endings somebody’s dream coming true
I still believe in waltzes and dancing the last one with you

1,A Lady Like You,Glen Campbell,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/glen-campbell/a-lady-like-you-chords-1787529,"Here I am
Just an ordinary man
And my virtues are few
And I'm amazed
Every morning when I wake
With a lady like you
You're all the good things God put on this earth
And you're so much more than I deserve
And what did I ever do to win a lady like you
Look at me
I'm as common as can be
But do you make me shine
And look at you
You're a lady through and through.
So gracious and kind
And when your sleeping softly by my side
I look at you and I'm mystified
And what did I ever do to win a lady like you
Heaven knows I'm less than perfect
And I have found the very best
But it's a mystery how someone like me
Was chosen to be blessed with a lady like you
You're all the good things God put on this earth
And you're so much more than I deserve
And what did I ever do to win a lady like you

2,Love Always Letter To Home,Glen Campbell,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/glen-campbell/love-always-letter-to-home-chords-1792497,"You might think there's some big reason
Why I took this time to write
The cards and letters there been too few of those
 I just stopped to realize, how long did I been home
and There's a few small things I need to know
Dear Daddy, do the Whippoorwill still echo through the night?
Does the sound of silence squeeze the morning light?
And have you caught the big one in the pond just down the road
I miss you so
Well, the years keeps slipping by me
Like the miles out on the road
But I don't guess I'll change my way of life
There's no harm in holdin' memories
So please tell me if you can
I need to bring them old times inside
Dear Momma, can you still find the dipper in stars?
do the roads still go for hours without cars?
And does the frost still shine, cold morning
On the grass outside the door
Just like before, tell me more
And I'll be back to see you sometime soon
Can you still reach out and almost touch the moon?
And do the old songs still ring out
Through the hills for days and days
Love always

Daddy stood there strong and silent,
it's always been his way.

as I heard my Daddy say
Son don't forget to call home, call home,
just to let us know you're safe and sound.
When the cold wind starts blowing,
If you need anything at all, just call home.
You know, Heaven helps the young and foolish,
Through the years they wonder.
Heaven holds the ones you love,
when the roll is called up yonder.
The old farms standing empty now,
but I'm filled with memories.
And I know the circle is unbroken,
when I fall down on my knees.
And I call home, I call home.

We all chase something and maybe this is a dream
The timeless face of a country man while his heart breaks
But the dream keeps coming even when you forget to feel

Every time I sit and look at pictures of used cars
She'll turn on her radio and sit down in her chair
And look at me across the room as if I wasn't there
Oh My stars, My Linda's gone to Mars
Well I wish she wouldn't leave me here alone
Oh My stars! My Linda's gone to Mars
Well, I wonder if she'd bring me something home.
Something, somewhere, somehow took my Linda by the hand
And secretly decoded our sacred wedding band
For when the moon shines down up on our happy, humble home
Her inner space gets tortured by some outer space unknown.
Now I ain't seen no saucers 'cept the ones upon the shelf
And if I ever seen one I'd keep it to myself
For if there's life out there somewhere beyond this life on earth
Then Linda must have gone out there and got her money's worth.

48,Hold On Tightly,John Denver,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-denver/hold-on-tightly-chords-1449902,"           Lost in a boat on the      ocean, 
    lost in a ship out of     sea, 
    Lost in the dark of mis -     fortune, 
    where is the light I can see. 
    Where is the highway to      heaven, 
    where is the love we all     need, 
    Where is the peace that we long     for, 
    where is the man who is     free.
    Here in the heart there is     freedom, 
    here in the heart there is     peace
    Here in the heart is the     answer, 
to    questions much deeper than    these. 
You´ve got to    hold on     tight -    ly, 
    let go       light -      ly
It´s     only sur -    render, 
it´s     all in the     game.
If you just     hold on      tight -     ly,
    let go       light -      ly
There´s     always for -     giveness 
and     no one to     blame
           Some will take fame over     fortune, 
    Some will take love over     gold, 
    Some will pray only for     power, 
    some never want to grow old 
    Some see the day that is      coming, 
    some only see what has      passed. 
    Someone will always be     first in line, 
    someone will always be     last.
    Here in the heart there is     freedom, 
    here in the heart there is     peace
    Here in the heart is the     answer,

49,Flight The Higher We Fly,John Denver,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-denver/flight-the-higher-we-fly-chords-2371625,"Oh, I have slipped the surly bonds of earth
And danced the sky on laughter silvered wings
Sunward I've climbed and joined the tumbling mirth
Of sun-split clouds and done a hundred things
I've wheeled and soared and swung high in the sunlit silence
Hovering there I've chased the shouting winds aloft
And flung my eager craft through footless halls of air
The higher we fly, the farther we go
The closer we are to each other
The darker the night, the brighter the star
In peace go my sisters and brother
Up, up, the long delirious burning blue
I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace
Where never lark nor even eagle flew
And while with silent lifting mind I trod
The high untrespassed sanctity of space
Put out my hand and touched the face of God
The higher we fly, the farther we go
The closer we are to each other
The darker the night, the brighter the star
In peace go my sisters and brother

0,To Live Is To Fly (ver 2),Townes Van Zandt,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/townes-van-zandt/to-live-is-to-fly-chords-1671903,"Won't say I love you babe
Won't say I need you babe
But I'm going to get you babe
and I will not do you wrong
Living's mostly wasting time
and I waste my share of mine
but it never feels too good
so let's not take too long
You're soft as glass, and I'm a gentle man
we got the sky to talk about
and the world to lie upon
Days up and down they come
like rain on a conga drum
forget most, remember some
but don't turn none away.
Everything is not enough
nothing is too much to bear
where you been is good and gone
all you keep's the getting there.
To live is to fly, low and high
so shake the dust off of your wings
and the sleep out of your eyes.
It's goodbye to all my friends
It's time to go again
Think of all the poetry
and the pickin' down the line.
I'll miss the system here
the bottom's low and the treble's clear
but it don't pay to think too much
on the things you leave behind.
I may be gone but I won't be long
I'll be bringing back the melody
and the rhythm that I find.
We all got holes to fill
and them holes are all that's real
some fall on you like a storm
sometimes you dig your own
But the choice is yours to make
And the time is yours to take
some dive into the sea
some toil upon the stone.
To live is to fly, low and high
so shake the dust off of your wings
and the sleep out of your eyes
so shake the dust off of your wings
and the tears out of your eyes

1,Rhinestone Cowboy (ver 4),Glen Campbell,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/glen-campbell/rhinestone-cowboy-chords-1051647,"I've been walkin' these streets so long
Singin' the same old song
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the   game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone
Well, I really don't mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll  do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There's be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me

4,She Believes In Me (ver 2),Kenny Rogers,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/kenny-rogers/she-believes-in-me-chords-1099511,"While she lays sleeping 
I stay out late at night and sing my songs 
And sometimes all the nights can be so long 
And it's good when I finally make it home -
All alone 
While she lays dreaming 
I try to get undressed without the light 
 And quietly she says how was your night 
And I come to her and say it was all right -
And I hold her tight 
And she believes in me 
I'll never know just what she sees in me 
I told her someday if she was my girl 
I could change the world with my little songs -
I was wrong 
But she has faith in me 
And so I go on trying faithfully 
And who knows, maybe on some special night 
If my  song is right 
I will find a way 
Find a way . . . 
While she lays waiting 
I stumble to the kitchen for a bite 
Then I see my old guitar in the night 
Just waiting for me like a secret friend -
And there's no end 
While she lies crying 
I fumble with a melody or two 
Then I'm torn between the things that I should do 
Then she says to wake her up when I am through 
God her love is true 
And she believes in me 
I'll never know just what she sees in me 
I told her someday if she was my girl 
I could change the world with my little songs -
I was wrong 
But she has faith in me 
And so I go on trying faithfully 
And who knows, maybe on some special night 
If my  song is right

He screamed like a panther in the middle of the night
And he saddled his pony
and went for a ride

I went out on the sea for adventure
Expanding the view of the captain and crew
like a man just released from indenture
As a dreamer of dreams and a travelin' man
I have chalked up many a mile.
Read dozens of books about heroes and crooks
and I learned much from both of their styles.
Son of a son, Son of a son
Son of a son of a sailor
Son of a gun, Load the last ton
One step ahead of the jailor
Now way in the near future,
Southeast of disorder
You can shake the hand of the mango man
As he greets you at the border
And the lady she hails from trinidad,
Island of the spices
Salt for your meat, and cinnamon sweet
And the rum is for all your good vices.
Haul the sheet in as we ride on the wind
That our fore-fathers harnessed before us
Hear the bells ring as the tight rigging sings
It's a son of a gun of a chorus
Now where it all ends, I can't fathom my friends
If I knew I might toss out my anchor
So I'll cruise along always searching for songs
Not a lawyer, a thief or a banker
But a son of a son, son of a son
Son of a son of a sailor
Son of a gun, load the last ton
One step ahead of the jailor
I'm just a son of a son, son of a son
Son of a son of a sailor

Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day
Well I smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and songs I'd been pickin'
Then I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playin' with a can that he was kickin'
Then I walked across the street

And Sunday mornin' comin' down

With a laughin' little girl that he was swingin'
Then I stopped beside a Sunday School
And listen to the songs they were singin'
Then I headed down the street
And somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringin'
And it echoed through the canyon
Like the disappearin' dreams of yesterday

I met up with the gambler; we were both too tired to sleep.
So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness
'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.
He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.
And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice.""
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow.
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light.
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.
Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
know when to walk away and know when to run.
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.
Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep.
'Cause ev'ry hand's a winner and ev'ry hand's a loser,
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.""
And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
know when to walk away and know when to run.
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.

Your breath's as hard as kerosene
You weren't your mama's only boy
But her favorite one it seems
She began to cry when you said goodbye
And sank into your dreams
Pancho was a bandit boys
His horse was fast as polished steel
Wore his gun outside his pants
For all the honest world to feel
Pancho met his match you know
On the deserts down in Mexico
Nobody heard his dying words
That's the way it goes
All the federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him hang around
Out of kindness I suppose
Lefty he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to
The dust that Pancho bit down south
Ended up in Lefty's mouth
The day they laid poor Pancho low
Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to go
There ain't nobody knows
All the federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him slip away

The poets tell how Pancho fell
Lefty's livin' in a cheap hotel
The desert's quiet and Cleveland's cold
So the story ends we're told
Pancho needs your prayers it's true,
But save a few for Lefty too
He just did what he had to do

  throughout the south
He spoke through tears of 15 years how his dog and him
  traveled about
  The dog up and died,   he up and died
     And after 20 years he still grieves 
He said I dance now at every chance in honky tonks
  for drinks and tips
But most the time I spend behind these county bars
  'cause I drinks a bit
   He shook his head, and as he shook his head
    I heard someone ask him please plee-ease
    Mr. Bojangles,      Mr. Bojangles
   Mr. Bojangles,   dance

On a warm summer night
And Cathy was cleaning the spoons
The radio played the hit parade
And I hummed a long with the tune
She asked me to change the station
Said the song just drove her insane
But it weren't just the music playing
It was me that she was trying to blame.
And the sky is black and still now
On the hill where the angels sing
Ain't it funny how an old broken bottle
Looks just like a diamond ring
But its far, far from me
Well I leaned on my left leg
In the parking lot dirt
And Cathy was closing the lights
A june bug flew from the warmth he once knew
And I wished for once I weren't right
Why we used to laugh together
And we'd dance to any old song.
Well ya know she still laughs with me
But she waits just a second too long.
And the sky is black and still now
On the hill where the angels sing
Ain't it funny how an old broken bottle
Looks just like a diamond ring
But its far, far from me
Well I started the engine
And I gave it some gas
And Cathy was closing her purse
Well we hadn't gone far in my beat up old car
And I was prepared for the worst.
Will you still see me tomorrow? 
No I got too much to do.
Well a question ain't really a question
If you know the answer too.

Hoping she'd come back again
Kept some letters by his bed
Dated 1962
He had underlined in red

I went to see him just today
Oh but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away

To the abandoned old prison down by Adrie Hill

But empty pop bottles was all we would kill.

And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
Well, they dug for their coal 'til the land was forsaken
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man.

But GM wouldn't miss just one little piece
Especially if I strung it out over several years
And the next day I got me an engine and a trunk
Then I got me a transmission and all the chrome
Like nuts and bolts and all four shocks
But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile home
Till we tried to put it all together one night
And that's when we noticed that something was definitely wrong
And the motor turned out to be a '73
And when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were gone
And with a little bit of help from an adapter kit
We had that engine running just like a song
We had two on the left and one on the right
But when we pulled out the switch all three of 'em come on
But we put it together and when we got through
Well that's when we noticed that we only had one tail fin
And I could see in her eyes that she had her doubts
But she opened the door and said honey take me for a spin
And I headed her right on down main drag
I could hear everybody laughing for blocks around
Cause to type it up it took the whole staff

So we took turns a starin' out the window at the darkness
'til boredom overtook us, and he began to speak.
He said, ""Son, I've made a life out of readin' people's faces,
and knowin' what their cards were by the way they held their eyes.
And if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces.
For a taste of your whiskey I'll give you some advice.""
So I handed him my bottle and he drank down my last swallow.
Then he bummed a cigarette, and asked me for a light.
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression.
Said, ""If you're gonna play the game, boy, ya gotta learn to play it right.
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,
know when to walk away and know when to run.
You never count your money when you're sittin' at the table.
There'll be time enough for countin' when the dealin's done.
Ev'ry gambler knows that the secret to survivin'
is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep.
'Cause ev'ry hand's a winner and ev'ry hand's a loser,
and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.""
And when he'd finished speakin', he turned back towards the window,
crushed out his cigarette and faded off to sleep.
And somewhere in the darkness the gambler, he broke even.
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep.
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,

To look in the mirror in total surprise
At the hair on my shoulders and the age in my eyes.

Fate should have made you a gentleman's wife

  Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
  Bobby thumbed a diesel down   just before it rained
  Took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
And was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time and Bobby clappin' hands we finally
Sang up every song that driver knew
   Freedom's just another word for  nothin' left to lose
   Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
   Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when   Bobby sang the blues
   Feeling good was good enough for me
    Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee
From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
   Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
   Standin' right beside me, Lord, through    everything I done
    Every night she kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
    lookin' for the home I hope she'll find
And I'd trade all my tomorrows for a    single yesterday
   Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
   Freedom's just another word for  nothin' left to lose
   Nothin' left is all she left for me
   Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when    Bobby sang the blues

   Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

I bid fare-well to old Ken-tucky
The place where I was born and raised
For six long years I've been in trouble
No pleasures here on earth I found
For in this world I'm bound to ramble
I have no friends to help me now
Maybe your friends think I’m just a stranger
A face you’ll never will see no more
But there is one promise that is given
I'll meet you (A capella) on God's golden shore

It'd been years since the kids had grown,
A life of their own and left us alone.
John and Linda live in Omaha,
And Joe is somewhere on the road.
We lost Davy in the Korean war,
And still don't know what for, don't matter anymore.
Ya know old trees just grow stronger,
And old rivers grow wilder ev'ry day.
Old people just grow lonesome
Waiting for someone to say, ""Hello in there, hello.""
Me and Loretta, we don't talk much more,
She sits and stares through the back door screen.
And all the news just repeats itself
Like some forgotten dream that we've both seen.
Someday I'll go and call up Rudy,
We worked together at the factory.
But what could I say if asks, ""What's new?""
Nothing, what's with you?  Nothing much to do.
Ya know old trees just grow stronger,
And old rivers grow wilder ev'ry day.
Old people just grow lonesome
Waiting for someone to say, ""Hello in there, hello.""
So if you're walking down the street sometime
And spot some hollow ancient eyes,
Oh, please don't just pass 'em by and stare
As if you didn't care, say, ""Hello in there, hello.""

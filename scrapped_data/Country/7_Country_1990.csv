She knows every trick in the book
She knows how to give; She knows how to take
’Cause so many times she's been taken and fooled
By   those
Alibis and lying eyes and all the best lines
Lord knows she's heard ‘em all
She's been cheated on and pushed around and left alone
Lord knows what I've put her through
And boy you can bet, if a move can be made
She knows how to make one on you
She once thought that love wasn't just a game
Her feelings once came from the heart
One day I gave her a wedding ring
And one night I tore all those feelings apart
With   my

2,Highway 29,Bruce Springsteen,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bruce-springsteen/highway-29-chords-84431,"I slipped on her shoe; she was a perfect size seven.
I said, ""There's no smoking in the store, ma'am.""
She crossed her legs and then
We made some small talk; that's where it should have stopped.
She slipped me her number; I put it in my pocket.
My hand slipped up her skirt; everything slipped my mind
In that little roadhouse
On Highway 29.
It was a small town bank; it was a mess.
Well, I had a gun.  You know the rest.
And she was cryin'; her and me we headed south
On Highway 29.
In a little desert motel, the air was hot and clean.
I slept the sleep of the dead; I didn't dream.
I woke in the morning, washed my face in the sink.
We headed into the Sierra Madres, 'cross the border line.
The winter sun shot through the black trees
I told myself it was all something in her
But as we drove I knew it was something in me,
Something that'd been comin' for a long, long time
And something that was here with me now
On Highway 29.
The road was filled with broken glass and gasoline.
She wasn't saying nothin'; it was just a dream.
All I could see was snow, sky and pines.
I closed my eyes and I was runnin'.
I was runnin' and then I was flyin'

Like the times that we spent
Hiding out from the rain under the carnival tent
I laughed and she'd smile
It would last for awhile
You don't know what you've got till you lose it all again
Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Oh, listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Oh, listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go
A cool evening dance
Listenin' to the bluegrass band takes the chill
From the air until they play the last song
I'll do my time
Oh, keeping you off my mind but there's moments
That I find, I'm not feeling so strong
Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Oh, listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Oh, listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go
Runnin' down by the lakeshore
She did love the sound of a summer storm
Playing on the lake like a mandolin
Now it's washing her away once again...whoa, again
The boat's steaming in
Oh, I watch the sidewheel spin
And I think about her when I hear that whistle blow
I can't change my mind
Oh, I knew all the time that she'd go
But that's a choice I made long ago
Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Oh, listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Oh, listen to the banjo wind
A sad song drifting low
Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go

Listen to the tears roll
Down my face as she turns to go
Listen to the tears roll

The classroom rang with children's voices under teacher's watchful eye.
We learned about the world around us at our desks and at dinner time.
Reminded of the starving children, we cleaned our plates with guilty minds.
And the stones in the road, shone like diamonds in the dust.
And then a voice called to us to make our way back home.
When I was ten my father held me on his shoulders above the crowd
to see a train all draped in mourning pass slowly through our town.
His widow kneeled with all their children at the sacred burial ground.
And the TV glowed that long hot summer with all the cities burning down.
And the stones in the road flew out beneath our bicycle tires.
Worlds removed from all those fires, as we raced each other home
And now we drink our coffee on the run; we climb that ladder rung by rung.
We are the daughters and the sons, and here's the line that's missing.
The starving children have been replaced by souls out on the street.
We give a dollar when we pass, and hope our eyes don't meet.
We pencil in, we cancel out; we crave the corner suite.
We kiss your ass, we make you hold; we doctor the receipt.
And the stones in the road fly out from beneath our wheels.
Another day, another deal, before we get back home.
Stones in the road leave a mark from whence they came.
A thousand points of light or shame; baby I don't know.

For all the wrongs I repeated, though I was to blame
I still cursed that rain
  I didn't have a prayer, didn't have a clue

God gave me you to show me what's real
There's more to life than just how I feel
And all that I'm worth is right before my eyes
And all that I live for though I didn't know why
Now I do, 'cause God gave me you
For all the times I wore my self pity like a favorite shirt
All wrapped up in that hurt
For every glass I saw, I saw half empty
Now it overflows like a river through my soul
  From every doubt I had, I’m finally free
  I truly believe

There's more to life than just how I feel
And all that I'm worth is right before my eyes

we're headed down into fall

hustled up a little dough
but I got drunk and I woke up rolled
a couple of months ago
they got my harp and they got my dollar
them low life so and so's
harps cost money and I ain't got it
it's my own fault I suppose
The Pocono's down but the Chesapeak's runnin'
two freights everyday
if it was just me I'd be headed south

She's got some pain and she thinks it's a baby,
says we gotta wait and see

hope he don't end up like me

I gotta stand in line again
I want to kill him but I just say no

I head back to the bridge, its getting kinda cold
I'm feelin' too low down to lie
I guess I'll just tell Marie the truth
hope she don't break down and cry
Marie she didn't wake up this morning
she didn't even try
she just rolled over and went to heaven

I laid them in the sun where somebody'd find them
caught a Chesapeak on the fly

Take a walk, just a little ways,
And as we walked, along  we talked
Of when would be,   our wedding day.
And only say, that you'll be mine,
In no o  thers arms entwined,
Down beside where the waters flow,
Down by the banks of the Ohio.
I asked her if she'd marry me,
And my wife forever be,
She only turned her head away
And had no other words to say.
And only say, that you'll be mine,
In no o  thers arms entwined,
Down beside where the waters flow,
Down by the banks of the Ohio.
I plunged a knife into her breast,
And told her she was going to rest,
She cried 'Oh Willie, don't murder me,
I'm not prepared for eternity.'
I took her by her golden curls,
And drug her down to the riverside,
And there I pushed her into drown,
And I watched her as she floated down.
And only say, that you'll be mine,
In no o  thers arms entwined,
Down beside where the waters flow,
Down by the banks of the Ohio.
And going home between twelve and one,
And cried 'Oh Lord, What have I done,
I've killed the only girl I love,
Because she would not marry me.
And only say, that you'll be mine,
In no o  thers arms entwined,
Down beside where the waters flow,

43,She Never Lets It Go To Her Heart,Tim McGraw,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tim-mcgraw/she-never-lets-it-go-to-her-heart-chords-76290,"Everywhere I go, they're staring at her
Every man I know, he wants to have her
   I guess I ought to be a jealous man
I look the other way, they're hitting on her
Every night and day, they telephone her
  They try and get to her but I know they can't
Cause she never lets it go, to her heart
She never lets it go, that far
When they start talking, she starts walking
Right back to my arms
She can turn every head
but she never lets it go to her heart
She walks into the room and everybody
Watches every move, hoping she don't love me
  I know it by the way, they hang around
But they don't realize there's more to her than
What meets the eye, that's why I'm certain
  No matter what they do to reach her now
She never lets it go, to her heart
She never lets it go, that far
When they start talking, she starts walking
Right back to my arms
She can turn every head
but she never lets it go to her heart
When they start talking, she starts walking
Right back to my arms
She can turn every head
but she never lets it go to her heart
(never lets it go to her heart)

44,Tear Stained Eye,Son Volt,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/son-volt/tear-stained-eye-chords-85067,"Walkin down Main Street, gettin' to know the concrete
Lookin for a purpose from a neon sign.
I would meet you anywhere western sun meets the air
I'll hit the road, never lookin' behind.
Can you deny, there's nothin' greater
nothin' more than travelin' hands of time
St. Genevieve can hold back the water,
but saints don't bother with a tear stained eye.
Seein' traces of the scars that came before
written in the pavement, still askin' for more
when the hours don't move along, worn-out wood and familiar songs
To hear your voice is not enough, is more than a shame.
Can you deny, there's nothin' greater
nothin' more than travelin' hands of time
St. Genevieve can hold back the water,
but saints don't bother with a tear stained eye.
Like a man said, rode hard and put away wet
throw away the bad news and put it to rest
If learnin' is livin', and the truth is a state of mind
you'll find it's better at the end of the line.
Can you deny, there's nothin' greater
nothin' more than travelin' hands of time
St. Genevieve can hold back the water,
but saints don't bother with a tear stained eye.

Chardonnay and cocaine in the spa
Cigarettes and coffee breath, little boys on crystal meth
Tonight we'll tango in the street

Tonight you're gonna let it all hang out
Pantyhose and aquanet, smokin' menthol cigarettes

Cognac and black coffee with the boys
Dancin' your buster browns, whirlin' to that techno sound
Your hands are wet, your hair is slick
You smoke big dick

Bruce and Jeff will pick you up at ten
Going out, dancin' in the city, Friday night, gotta look pretty

Oh, say can you smell her for the smoke
Who says He can't take a dirty joke
Power isn't, power does and power slips away
It's so easy to abuse
Who'd've thought them Arabs would've bought
The USA just to give it to the Jews
Singin' crime still don't pay just like it used to
And you know that time slips away till you die
And you know that I don't give a damn when I choose to
And you know that it don't hurt so bad when you're high
Oh, say does the future of the homesick
And the brave even matter anymore
To run away than there was to fight before
Would you tell me why the hell we'd try to win back in a war
What we wasted in the last?
Might just ain't as righteous as it used to be before
When your army's out of gas
Singin' crime still don't pay just like it used to
And you know that time slips away till you die
And you know that I don't give a damn when I choose to
And you know that it don't hurt so bad when you're high
Singin' crime still don't pay just like it used to
And you know that time slips away till you die
And you know that I don't give a damn when I choose to
And you know that it don't hurt so bad when you're high

When this fella came on the TV
That heartaches are healed by the sea
That got me goin' without even knowin'
I packed right up and drove down
Now I'm on a roll and I swear to my soul
Tonight I'm gonna paint this town
So bring me two Pina Coladas I gotta have one for each hand
Oh, and never leave dry land
Troubles I forgot 'em I buried 'em in the sand
So bring me two Pina Coladas
She said good-bye to her good timin' man
Oh now I've gotta say that the wind and the waves
And the moon winkin' down at me
The heartaches that love often brings
Now I've got a smile that goes on for miles
With no inclination to roam
I've gotta say that I think I've gotta stay
'Cause this is feelin' more and more like home
So bring me two Pina Coladas I gotta have one for each hand
Oh, and never leave dry land
Troubles I forgot 'em I buried 'em in the sand
So bring me two Pina Coladas
She said good-bye to her good timin' man

You just dont seem to hold me like you used to
Something's going  on
I've got that old feelin
You're leavin
I'm so tired of goodbye
I cant wait on your love forever
While you change your mind
Mornin finds us face to face
I feel you staring through me
While I'm talkin
Whats come over  you
Familiar looks I recognize
The same old looks that said
Goodbye the last time
Somethin I'm use to
I've got that old feelin

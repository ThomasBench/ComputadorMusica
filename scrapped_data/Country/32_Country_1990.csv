0,Last To Know (ver 2),Blue Rodeo,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/blue-rodeo/last-to-know-chords-1398604,"What took so long to build, took a moment to slip away,
You could barely hide the satisfaction from your face.
Time takes another day,
changes you in subtle ways,
lifts you up then slowly lets you go.
Sitting there across the room your smile looks like a threat,
living underneath the heel of what you might do next,
memory works in strange ways, 
cuts you down and makes you pay,
one day youll be walking fine,
the next day lightning will hit you from behind.
One heart, one love, two people who cant rise above.
Each time we fall dont know what I was thinking of.
And dont say its so, dont say its so,
Oh, let me be the last to know.
Seems we move backwards now the further on we walk, 
Its hard to find a single line through all our double talk, 
Home late and drunk again, Close the door, shut out the rain, 
One more day no damage done, My spirits falling, sinking like the sun
One heart, one love, two people who cant rise above.
Each time we fall dont know what I was thinking of.
And dont say its so, dont say its so,
Oh, let me be the last to know.
Standing at your doorway I can hear your voice inside, 
telling all your friends what youre gonna say to me tonight, 
oh, write me a better part, find the words to break your heart, 
keep you on your knees forever, funny how my tongue gets tied together,
One heart, one love, two people who cant rise above.
Each time we fall dont know what I was thinking of.
And dont say its so, dont say its so,
Oh, let me be the last to know.

3,The Song Remembers When,Trisha Yearwood,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/trisha-yearwood/the-song-remembers-when-chords-1540271,"I was standing at the counter, I was waiting for the change
When I heard that old familiar music start
It was like a lighted match had been tossed into my soul
It was like a dam had broken in my heart
After taking every detour, getting lost and losing track
So that even if I wanted, I could not find my way back
After driving out the memory of the way things might have been
After I'd forgotten all about us
The song remembers when
We were rolling through the Rockies, we were up above the clouds
When a station out of Jackson played that song
And it seemed to fit the moment, and the moment seemed to freeze
When we turned the music up and sang along
And there was a god in heaven, and the world made perfect sense
We were young and were in love, and we were easy to convince
We were headed straight for Eden, it was just around the bend
And though I have forgotten all about it
The song remembers when
I guess something must have happened
And we must have said good-bye
And my heart must have been broken
Though I can't recall just why
The song remembers when      
Well, for all the miles between us, and for all the time that's past
You would think I haven't gotten very far
And I hope my hasty heart, will forgive me just this once
If I stop to wonder how on earth you are
But that's just a lot of water, underneath a bridge I burned
And there's no use in backtracking, around corners I have turned
Still I guess some things we bury, are just bound to rise again
For even if the whole world has forgotten
The song remembers when
Yeah, and even if the whole world has forgotten
The song remembers when

And I wish I weren't so thick
I'm making myself sick
And if that phone don't ring one more time
I'm gonna lose what's left of my mind
You made a big impression for a girl of your size
Now I can't get by without you and your big brown eyes

Since it's gone I'm so withdrawn
Right beside the ocean my darlin' Clementine
Well the water got high and she never got dry and
She was a water sign
Time is on my bad side
Halfway there just wouldn't be fair
So I'm goin' all the way tonight
Halfway there just wouldn't be fair
So I'm goin' all the way tonight
Just like California to make a fool of me
Slide into the sea
I'm a thinking person, and I think that it's wrong
To keep on saying true love's waitin'
Time is on my bad side
Halfway there just wouldn't be fair
So I'm goin' all the way tonight
Halfway there just wouldn't be fair
So I'm goin' all the way tonight

where the pine trees pine for the fall of night,
you believe in cards, you believe in signs
and I'll be leavin' soon, but I'm here tonight.
On a mountainside, well below the stars,
keep your lovers eyes in mason jars
and I should be scared but I feel no fear,
'cause I'll be leavin' soon, tonight I'm here.
And even if you are the one, and even if the cards are all true,
when the curtain calls, oh baby, what's a boy to do?

It ain't done one single lick of good.
I'm still a drunk and I'm still a loser.
living in a lousy neighborhood. 
I got a real live horseshoe,
And I hung it upside-down above my door.
But it don't do nothing to attract you,
So I don't know what the hell it's for. 
Why don't you come over? I'll show you my four leaf clover.
Aww, who am I trying to kid? I'm not the kind of guy you go for.
I got a four leaf clover, but I ain't got no hope of getting you. 
I got a lucky silver dollar.
My granddad gave it to me now he's dead.
At times like this I wish that I could join him,
It might just stop this pounding in my head.

Too many Trail of Tears
Too many times you were left cold
For oh so many years
Too many times you walked away
And was made to feel ashamed
And though you only tried to give
You were often blamed

you are.
If it's wrong or right, I gotta go where you

I'll roam through the dismal swampland searching 
for you.
Cause if you are lost there, let me be there, too.
Through the smoke and flame I gotta go where you 
are.
For no place could be too far, where you are.
Ain't no chains can bind you, if you live, I'll 
find you.
Love is calling me, I gotta go where you are.
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.........I gotta go where you are.

The Ford got hot, wouldn't do no more
It done got cloudy and started to rain
Tooted my horn for the passin' lane
The rain water poured up under my hood
Knew that were doin' my motor good
Maybelline why can't you be true?

Cadillac looked like a ton of lead
A hundred and ten a half a mile ahead
Cadillac looked like it's standin' still
And I caught Maybelline at the top of the hill

I don't heve no money, not even a dime 
but I brought Mama flowers like I have all the time
Every day I'd pick flowers from this pretty hill
a small box of daisy's and a few daffodils
I'd bring them to Mama at the end of the day
and say flowers for Mama, here's Mama's bouquet
They'd brighten her face and she'd hold me close
she'd say they were more precious than a beautiful rose
and she wore a smile sweeter than millions of flowers
a smile that I'll carry through life's darkest hour
Now Mama was lying there, yes they tell me she'd passed away
and she was surrounded by flowers that outshined my bouquet
I know mine aren't fancy, but still all the while
they were placed in her hand and I know I saw Mama smile
Flowers for Mama, I picked them today
not very much, just a simple bouquet 
Mom Wasn't so fancy, but up there above 
she's the prettiest flower in God's garden of love

A sweet September in your eyes
November notions in the clothes you wear
You're every season's work of art
But there's a cold December in your heart
It seemed to me the day we met
that all the flowers had begun to bloom
I thought you'd help me to forget
The dusty shadows of my lonely room
I should've known right from the start
About the cold December in your heart
I loved you more and more each day
Through every season of the year
Your lovin' laughter seemed to say
Your life was empty when I wasn't near
Old love would lead you to the grave
I was a fool to think you loved my too
You always took but you never gave
Until you've taken all my love for you
I feel a chill I must depart
and leave the cold   December in your heart
In your heart,
in your heart

when your magazine memory has spun you around
and you realise your lovers were just painted clowns
and outside your window you start hearing sounds
where they're building a cross for to burn you
when all your bright scarlet turns slowly to blue
will you stop and decide that it's over?
when your tear drops go sour and no longer fall
to splash cross the virgin that lives down the hall
and spends all her nights with an ear to your wall
well then, what will you have you can offer?
when the fire dancers finish and leave you alone
with nothing but embers and sacks full of stone
that hang 'round your neck slicing through to the bone
will there be a place for your laughter?
when all your bright scarlet turns slowly to blue
will you stop and decide that it's over?
when your shattered illusions come a-tumbling home
and all of your butchers you've nourished have grown
and they're suddenly able to leave you alone
and they run like slaves that are set free
when your questions are answered and your pleading is done
and your mind starts a-screaming that you ain't the one
that once dwelled within you, will you turn? will you run?
But, Princess, will you come home and get me?
when all your bright scarlet turns slowly to blue
will you stop and decide that it's over?

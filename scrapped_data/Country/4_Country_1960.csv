And I know I should go home
But every time I start to leave
They play another song
And someone buys another round
And where ever drinks are free
What's made Milwaukee famous has made a fool out of me
Baby's begged me not to go
So many times before
She says love and happiness 
Can't live behind those swingin doors
Now she's gone and I'm to blame 
Too late I finally see
What's made Milwaukee famous has made a loser out of me

All the harps they sound empty when she lifts her lips to the sky
All the brown of her skin makes her hair seem a soft golden rainfall
That spills from the mountains to the bottomless depths of her eyes
Well, she stands all around me, her hands slowly sifting the sunshine
All the laughter that linger down deep 'neath her smilin' is free
Well, it spins and it twirls like a hummingbird lost in the morning
And caresses the south wind and silently sails to the sea
Ah, the sculptor stands stricken and the artist he throws 'way his brushes
When her image comes dancin', the sun she turns sullen with shame
And the birds they go silent, and the wind stops his sad mournful singing
When the trees of the forest start gently to whisperin' her name
So as softly she wanders I'll desperately follow her footsteps
And I'll chase after shadows that offer a trace of her sight
Ah, they promise eternally that she lies hidden within them
But I find they've deceived me and sadly I bid them goodbye
So the serpent slides slowly away with his moments of laughter
And the old washerwoman has finished her cleanin' and gone
But the bamboo hangs heavy in the bondage of quicksilver daydreams
And a lonely child longingly looks for a place to belong

to seek the wisdom of the children
and the graceful way of flowers in the wind.

their laughter and their loveliness would clear a cloudy day.
Like the music of the mountains and the colors of the rainbow
they're a promise of the future
and the blessing for today.
Though the city starts to crumble and the towers fall around us
the sun is slowly fading and it's colder than the sea
it is written: From the desert to the mountains they shall lead us
by the  hand and by the  heart and they will comfort you and me.
In their innocence and trusting, they will teach us to be free.
For the children and the flowers are my sisters and my brothers,
their laughter and their loveliness would clear a cloudy day.

Reviewing the scenes new and old
I found an old fashioned log cabin
So beautiful there to be hold
A stranger was standing in silence
His eyes firmly fixed on the door
My heart ached in pity to see him
For these were the words that it bore
And the sign read an old cabin for sale
An old Oaken bucket and well
Easy terms just keep a log on the fire
And a light burning bright in the dell
Many years an old couple did patiently look
For their boy whose last promise did fail
Now the old rocking chair will be rocking no more
There's an old log cabin for sale
A welcome I read on the floor mat
An old braided rug by the door
The hands of an angel had made it
With many a prayer prayed before
In an old rocking chair long she waited
For one glimpse of him how she yearned
And now he was standing in silence
Too late yes too late he'd returned
And the sign read an old cabin for sale
An old Oaken bucket and well
Easy terms just keep a log on the fire
And a light burning bright in the dell 
Many years an old couple did patiently look
For their boy whose last promise did fail
Now the old rocking chair will be rocking no more
There's an old log cabin for sale

And seek not your fortune in the dark dreary mine
It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul
Till the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal
Where it's dark as a dungeon, damp as the dew
Danger is double and pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls, the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine
Well, it's many a man that I've known in my day
That would live just to labor his whole life away
Like a fiend with his dope, like a drunkard with his wine
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine
And I pray when I'm dead and the ages shall roll
That my body would blacken and turn into coal
Then I'd look from the door of my heavenly home
And pity the miner digging my bones
Where it's dark as a dungeon, damp as the dew
Danger is double and the pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls, the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine

1,The Ride (ver 5),David Allan Coe,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/david-allan-coe/the-ride-chords-1463355,"I was thumbin from Montgomery
I had my guitar on my back
When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac
He was dressed like 1950
Half-drunk and hollow-eyed
He said ""It's a long walk to Nashville, would you like a ride, son?""
Well I sat down in the front seat
And he turned on the radio
And them sad old songs comin outta them speakers was solid country gold
Then I noticed the stranger was ghost-white pale when he asked me for a light
And I knew there was somethin strange about this ride
He said ""Drifter, can you make folks cry when you play and sing?""
""Have you paid your dues?  Can you moan the blues?""
""Can you bend them guitar strings?""
He said ""Boy, can you make folks feel what you feel inside?""
""Cause if you're big star bound, let me warn ya it's a long hard ride""
Well he cried just south of Nashville
And he turned that car around
He said ""This is where you get off, boy, cause I'm goin' back to Alabam'
As I stepped out of that Cadillac
I said ""Mister, many thanks.""
He said ""You don't have to call me mister, mister""
""The whole world called me Hank""
He said ""Drifter, can you make folks cry when you play and sing?""
""Have you paid your dues?  Can you moan the blues?""
""Can you bend them guitar strings?""

Wearin older faces
And talk about the places they have been
Two Old sweethearts who fell apart
Somewhere long ago - how were they to know
that someday they'd meet again
and have a need for more than reminiscing...
Maybe this time it'll be loving they'll find -
maybe now they can be more than just friends.
She's back in his life and it feels so right
maybe this time love won't end.
It’s the same old Feeling back again
It`s The one that they had back when
They were too young to know when love is real
But Somehow Something, never change
And Even time hasn`t cooled the flame
It`s even Burning brighter than they did before
It Got Another Chance and If They Take it
Maybe this time it'll be loving they'll find -
maybe now they can be more than just friends.
She's back in his life and it feels so right
maybe this time love won't end.
She`s smiling like she use to smile way back then
He`s Feelin like He used to feel way back when they
Tried, But something Kept them, Waiting for this
Magic Moment.
Maybe this time it'll be loving they'll find -
maybe now they can be more than just friends.

Good always wins

I'd never be blue.

It's not that easy at all,

It's real tears that fall.

Is how the boy don't always get the girl,
Here in the real world.

But that wasn't enough,
To hold your heart
When times got rough.
And tonight on that silver screen,
It'll end like it should,
Two lovers will make it through
Like I hoped we would.

Cause when hearts get broken,
It's real tears that fall.

For the stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side, slowly looking all around
He's an outlaw loose and running, came the whisper from each lip
And he's here to do some business with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
In this town, there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead 
He was vicious and a killer though a youth of twenty-four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more
One and nineteen more
Now the stranger started talking, made it plain to folks around
He was an Arizona Ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter, he was after Texas Red
After Texas Red
The morning passed so quickly, it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from their windows, everybody held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
Was about to meet his death
There was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
The big iron on his hip
Big iron,   big iron
When he tried to match the ranger
With the big iron on his hip

Was gonna keep you free and clean
But now you wear your skin like iron
And your breath's as hard as kerosene
You weren't your mama's only boy
But her favorite one, it seems
She began to cry when you said good bye
And sank into your dreams
Pancho was a bandit, boys
Rode a horse fast as polished steel
Wore his guns outside his pants
For all the honest world to fear
Pancho met his match, you know
On the deserts down in Mexico
No one heard his dyin' words
But that's the way it goes
And all the federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him slip away
Out of kindness, I suppose
Now Lefty he can't sing the blues
All night long like he used to
The dust that Pancho bit down South
It ended up in Lefty's mouth
The day they laid old Pancho low
Lefty split for Ohio
Where he got the bread to go
Well there ain't nobody 'knows
And all the federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him slip away
Out of kindness, I suppose
Now poets sing how Pancho fell
Lefty's livin' in a cheap hotel
The desert's quiet and Cleveland's cold
And so the story ends, we're told
Pancho needs your prayers, it's true
But save a few for Lefty, too
He only did what he had to do
And now he's growin' old
And all the federales say
They could have had him any day
They only let him go so long
Out of kindness, I suppose
Yes a few old gray federales still say
They could have had him any day
They only let him go so long
Out of kindness, I suppose

A shelter from the storm
It exists to give you comfort
It's there to keep you warm
And in those times of trouble
When you are most alone
The memory of love will bring you home
Perhaps love is like a window
Perhaps an open door
It invites you to come closer
It wants to show you more
And even if you lose yourself
And don't know what to do
The memory of love will see you through
   Oh ! Love to some is like a cloud
   To some as strong as steel
   For some a way of living
   For some a way to feel
   And some say love is holding on
   And some say letting go
   And some say love is everything
   Some say they don't know
Perhaps love is like the ocean
Full of conflicts, full of pain
Like a fire when it's cold outside
Thunder when it rains
If I should live forever
And all my dreams come true
My memory of love will be of you

just having a cup to pass the time
swapping rodeo stories with this old cowboy friend of mine.
When some motorcycle riders started snickering in the back
started poking fun at my friend's hat.
One old boy said ""hey Tex, where'd you park your horse""
My friend just pulled his hat down low, but they couldn't be ignored.
One husky fella said ""I think I'll rip that hat right off your head"".
That's when my friend turned around, and this is what he said...
You'll ride a black tornado across a western sky.
Rope an old blue northern and milk it 'till it's dry.
Bulldog the Mississippi, pin its ears down flat
Long before you take this cowboy's hat.
Now partner, this old hat's better left alone.
You see, it used to be my daddy's, but last year he passed on.
My nephew skinned the rattler that makes up this old hat band.
But back in '69, he died in Vietnam.
Now the eagle feather was given to me by an Indian friend of mine.
Someone ran him down somewhere around that Arizona line.
And a real special lady give me this hat pin,
And I don't know if I'll ever see her again.
You'll ride a black tornado across a western sky.
Rope an old blue norther and milk it 'till it's dry.
Bulldog the Mississippi, pin its ears down flat
Long before you take this cowboy's hat.
Now if your leather jacket means to you what this hat means to me,
then I guess we understand each other, and we'll just let it be.
But if you still think it's funny, Man, you got my back up against the wall,
And if you touch my hat, you're gonna have to fight us all.
Well right then I caught a little sadness in that gang leader's eyes.
He turned back to the others and they all just kind of shuffled on outside.
But when my friend turned back towards me I noticed his old hat brim
Well it was turned up in a big old Texas grin!
You'll ride a black tornado across a western sky.
Rope an old blue norther and milk it 'till it's dry.

Grandpa,   take me back to yesterday
When the line      between right and wrong        //    //
     Didn't seem    so hazy
  Did lovers really fall in love to stay
And stand beside each other come what may?
Was a promise really something people kept
Not just something they would say? 
Did families really bow their heads to pray?
Did daddies really never go away?  
Whoa Oh, Grandpa, tell me 'bout the good old days
Grandpa,         everything is changin' fast
We call it progress, but I just don't know
And Grandpa,     let's wander back into the past
Then paint me the picture     Of long ago
  Did lovers really fall in love to stay
And stand beside each other come what may?

Not just something they would say? (And then forget)

When I walked through the front door my whole life was changed
Cause nobody answered when I called your name
A note on the table that told me goodbye
It said you'd grown weary of living a lie
Your love has ended but mine still remains
But nobody answers when I call your name
Oh the lonely sound of my voice calling
Is driving me insane
And just like rain the tears keep falling

Maybe the sun's light will be dim
and it won't matter anyhow.
If morning's echo says we’ve sinned,
well, it was what I wanted now.
And if we're the victims of the night,
I won't be blinded by light.

In every dictionary, but no where defined
Love is a man and he's mine

Love is alive and it grows everyday at night even in our sleep
Love is alive and its made a happy woman out of me
Oh, love is alive, and here by me
Love ain't just a room	
A distant far away dream that leads the night to rise, Love is alive
And love ain't just a song, sweet words of music to go dancin' by
Love is a man and he's mine (Oh) *repeat chorus* 2x's
Love is alive...

Hey, I'm not trying to be nobody
I just want a chance to be myself
I've spent a thousand miles of thumbin'
Yes I've worn blisters on my heels
Trying to find me something better
Here on the streets of Bakersfield
Hey you don't know me, but you don't like me

But how many of you that sit and judge me
Have ever walked the streets of Bakersfield?
Spent sometime in San Francisco
I spent a night there in the can
They threw this drunk man in my jail cell
I took fifteen dollars from that man
Left him my watch and my old house key
Don't want folks thinkin' that I'd steal
Then I thanked him as I was leaving
And I headed out for Bakersfield

I was out fighting with my grandpa's gun
They can follow me as best they can
But I can run quicker when there is no sun
Shine on
Shine on
Shine on
Shine on
Yeah the government of this state
Ain't the only way that the sherrif gets paid
You can try to hide who you are
But they'll see straight through your charade
Shine on
Shine on
Shine on
Shine on
Where do the hound dogs eat
When the people are frail?
Where does the smoke from your lungs go
Once you exhale?
What do the cockroaches do
With no one 'round?
They live like the moonshiners
Half underground
Yes it was me that burned it down
To confound everyone and make it well known
That after 33 years of this
I've got a government of my own
Shine on
Shine on
Shine on
Shine on
Where do the hound dogs eat
When the people are frail?
Where does the smoke from your lungs go
Once you exhale?
What do the cockroaches do
With no one 'round?
They live like the moonshiners
Half underground

In a 'shoulda done this, shoulda done that'?
Try to do the best you can
'Cause you wanna be good but you love to be bad
Your stress relief comes with the need
To kick the work week's ass
If you're feelin' this then catch a buzz
There's always one more beer you gotta drink
One more song on the jukebox
Could blame it all on my roots
I'm feelin' this temptation in my current situation
But morning's gonna come, gonna be early
Gotta go to work, gonna get dirty
Shoulda stayed in, instead I went out
But I oughta know that by now
Had me a girl but it went south
Whatever was workin' didn't work out
It could've been my ramblin' ways
My rowdy friends, hell, I can't say
Ain't got time for slowing down
I'm shiftin' gears and headin' out
A good time's callin' my name
One more beer you gotta drink

2,Nobody Leaves A Girl Like That,Jon Pardi,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jon-pardi/nobody-leaves-a-girl-like-that-chords-2850866,"She's got the kind of eyes you wanna get lost in
You're gonna look twice when she gets to walkin'
In a honky tonk with them blue jeans on
She's a cold beer, a whiskey shot, a neon light
A Strait song on the jukebox, a dance all night
What a cowboy wants, a never-do-you-wrong
Nobody leaves a girl like that
Nobody walks away and never looks back
You'd have to be outta your mind
To tell somethin' that good goodbye
Nobody goes and breaks a heart of gold
Once you get a girl like that, you never let her go
Take it from me, nobody leaves a girl like that
I was reckless and wild, didn't think I was ready
Couldn't settle me down, so I fired up my Chevy
I was stubborn and she was cryin'
Well, she knew she couldn't stop me, but she kept right on tryin'
Nobody leaves a girl like that
Nobody walks away and never looks back
You'd have to be outta your mind
To tell somethin' that good goodbye
Nobody goes and breaks a heart of gold
Once you get a girl like that, you never let her go
Take it from me, nobody leaves a girl like that
She's the kind of girl that only comes around once
Well, she found somebody new and I'm goin' crazy because
Nobody leaves a girl like that
Nobody walks away and never looks back
You'd have to be outta your mind
To tell somethin' that good goodbye
Nobody goes and breaks a heart of gold
Once you get a girl like that, you never let her go

no chocolate covered candy hearts to give away.
No first of spring, no song to sing,
in fact here`s just another ordinary day.
No April rain, no flowers bloom,
no wedding Saturday within the month of June.
But what it is, is something new,
made up of these three words that I must say to you.
I just called to say I love you,
I just called to say how much I care.
I just called to say I love you,
and I mean it from the bottom of my heart.
No summer`s high, no warm July,
no harvest moon to light one tender August night.
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves,
not even time for birds to fly to southern skies.
No Libra Sun, no Halloween,
no giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring.
But what it is, though old, so new.
to fill your heart like no three words could ever do.
I just called to say I love you,
I just called to say how much I care.
I just called to say I love you,
and I mean it from the bottom of my heart.

Cause there's boys in the hills and they're getting lost tonight
And the girls in their cars are all getting high
I use to hang around a rowdy crowd out in the Rogers
Siren sounds ain't nothing boys as long as you can dodger
And I had no idea this damn road got so curvy
You said brother this roads straight you're just drunk and it's getting early
So won't you count em' up now count em' up all the people that I've let down
Won't you round em' up now round em' up all the liars in this town
Cause I'm coming home and I'm toeing the line
I just hope those boys I used to know are all doing fine
Doing fine
And I remember those old trains they made noises like a steam boat
And we would throw our rocks at them like some assholes with some high hopes
Can't get back those aimless nights that we all claim is ours
I guess we'll never die up there with all those ever shining stars
So won't you count em' up now count em' up all the people that I've let down
Won't you round em' up now round em' up all the liars in this town

You broke down, we broke up, and we were sayin' it was over
But here I am now, with your head on my shoulder...
If tellin' each other goodbye is gonna lead to a long slow kiss
And if you tearin' out my drive is gonna get us makin' love like this
'Cause it's crazy to think that yesterday we weren't even talkin'
If this is how it's gonna be
Then baby maybe we should break up more often
You left the charger by the bed
And that jacket that you always wore
So I shot you that text, said they're sittin' outside on the porch
But last night you showed up, I saw you standin' there at my door
Now that dress you had on is layin' on my floor

All my life I've loved in vain

A little poison in your drink to ease my nerves

Who gave up on his dreams when he was young
Naming every hour that he wasted
After things he could have done
But I won't put up with it
No I'll put it down
I've learned to bury things I hate deep in the ground
And I carry all the little trophies of your touch
But today, I'm gonna beat you to the punch

By the fire in your eyes, by the skin of my teeth

Far as I can tell
There gotta be something behind me
Lord, cause I feel I'm doing well
I ain't been staying up late
Making folks wait like I've done before
For me to get on track
Make up for what I lack
Black crow, I ain't a joke no more
Cold, cold empty home
What's a man to do when he ain't got no dough?
And his door's been kicked in
By the damn tax man two days ago
Well, he gets a case of the fools
So he pulls out his gun
Corner store's a good aim
To make a little change
But it's a shame to blame some innocent one
Lord, I can feel them spirits pulling me down
And a hundred and ten in the pen
Is a long time when you did no crime
       They got the wrong man on that chain
A hundred and ten in the shade (Where I stand)
I'm a different man
I guess I'll say old crow
I do confess
What good is freedom outside these walls
If you're living dead
I'm gonna pay my dues
Make up no excuse like I did before
Make it right with the Lord
I told the sheriff so
Black crow I ain't a joke no more

I'm too pretty for that
Let's just say I'm the last thing you wanna see coming
I'm the reason they say watch your back
But for so long, I was like a wounded hound
Backed into a chain-link fence
 The world at large was just a big, mean kid
Poking me through the fence with a stick
Ain't nobody goin' back
 It takes a whole lotta hurt
 To realize one of life's biggest lessons
Ain't got nothing to do with deserving
Just pray to the Saint of Lost Causes
Now it's a cruel world
But it ain't hard to understand
 You got your sheep, got your shepherds
Got your wolves amongst men
  It can be hard to tell
You might find a wolf in shepherd's clothes
  And now and then you're gonna find sheep
In amongst all those troubled souls
  You know the folks that's most afraid of the wolf
 If you really stop and think
  Throughout time, between a wolf and a shepherd
Who do you think has killed more sheep?
 Nah, there's nothing can be done
  It's just the way it goes
 First you get bad, then you get mean
Then there's nothing left but to grow cold
And pray to the Saint of Lost Causes
Some will say I've got no feeling
 No heart, and surely no shame
 Truth is that this has been with me so long
That I, I must admit I kinda like the pain
How many encounters do you ever have
 But again, how many wolves you ever seen?
You got about as much chance of seeing one of them
As you do running into me
  Still take nothing for granted
Might live on the best block in Beverly Hills
Be sure you lock up tight at night
You know poor folks ain't got nothing to steal
Just pray to the Saint of Lost Causes

And pile 'em up by the horse trough in the lot
Cuz they sell by the pound and weigh like lead when you wet 'em down

But there's nothing under this ground worth a damn
Now the sheriff's on his way, and it's for damn sure not our day
It's just our time.

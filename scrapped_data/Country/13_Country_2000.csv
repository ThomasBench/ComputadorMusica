0,You Belong With Me (ver 4),Taylor Swift,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/taylor-swift/you-belong-with-me-chords-823570,"You’re on the phone with your girlfriend, she’s upset
She’s going off about something that you said
‘Cause she doesn’t get your humour like I do
I’m in the room it’s a typical Tuesday night
I’m listening to the kind of music she doesn’t like
And she’ll never know your story like I do
But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She’s cheer captain and I’m on the bleachers
Dreaming ‘bout the day when you’ll wake up and find
That what you’re looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I’m the one that understands you
Been here all along, so why can’t you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me
Walkin’ the streets with you and your worn out jeans
I can’t help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on park bench, thinking to myself
And you’ve got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven’t seen it in a while since she brought you down
Hey whatcha doing with a girl like that?
But she wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She’s cheer captain and I’m on the bleachers
Dreaming ‘bout the day when you’ll wake up and find
That what you’re looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I’m the one that understands you
Been here all along, so why can’t you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby
You belong with me, you belong with me
Oh I remember you drivin’ to my house
In the middle of the night
I’m the one that makes you laugh
When you know you’re ‘bout to cry
And I know your favourite songs
And you tell me ‘bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it’s with me
If you could see that I’m the one that understands you
Been here all along, so why can’t you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby
You belong with me, you belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever just thought maybe
You belong with me, you belong with me

I don't know how you stayed or why
Lookin' always over my shoulder

Josephine,
Josephine.

And I had to know where it all ends.
I lived so long with the shadows,
Lord I became one of them.

Now I take the hand I took for granted
And set it free

And never need to know how it all ends
Leave the shadows behind
Don't go chasin' after them
You lock the door and put them old records on
I hear you cryin' along
O what a fool I've been
O what a fool I've been
No more will the final words
Be the tears in your eyes
O how I tried
O, how I tried!
O, Josephine,
You are free.

You’re always on my mind

and a moment came that stopped me on a dime
I spent most of the next days looking at the x-rays
talking ‘bout the options and talkin’ ‘bout sweet time
I asked him when it sank in if this might really be the real end
How’s it hit ‘cha when you get that kind of news, man what’cha do?
I went sky diving
I went rocky mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu
And I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter and I gave forgiveness id been
denying
and he said some day I hope you get the chance to live like you were dying
He said I was finally the husband that most the time I wasn’t
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all of a sudden going fishin’ wasn’t such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my dad
Well I finally read the Good Book and I took a good long hard look
at what I'd do if I could do it all again and then…
I went sky diving
I went rocky mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu
And I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter and I gave forgiveness id been denying
and he said some day I hope you get the chance to live like you were dying
Like tomorrow was a gift and you got eternity to think about what you’d do with it?
What could you do with it
What could I do with it
What would I do with it
I went sky diving
I went rocky mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu
And I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter and I watched an eagle as it was flying
and he said some day I hope you get the chance to live like you were dying

To live like you were dying
To live like you were dying

It's harder than it looks

When she's gone the world goes dark

She's cute when she's mad
And she does all the wrong things right
Yeah boy it's a fact when they're made like that

Wound up in a few wrong towns

Spend my time with the whiskey

Johnson City, Tennessee.
I was gassing up my Firebird,
When I heard her callin' me.
Said ""Which way are you headed boy?
Do you need some company?""
She had me stopping at a Kwik-Mart,
Before we made it outta town.
Next thing she was runnin' at me,
Tellin' me to lay that hammer down.

Doin' his best to slow me down.

Smoking stolen Marlboro Lights.
Lord, we never saw 'em comin'
'Til they read us both our rights.

With a sheriff right beside me,
Pistol pointed at my side.

For this modern day Bonnie and Clyde.

Batteries to keep her electrical appliances a-going steady

Down along the railroad tracks, waitin in the weeds
The first freight train to the leave the yard, will be the one for me
I’ll find a place on the box car roof, where the wind cuts cold and deep
I don’t need no railroad man, to catch me in my sleep
One kiss before I leave you, and one more for the wind
Everyday I hope and pray, to be with you again
To be with you again

Through the iron hills
Under infidel skies
It's two hundred miles to drive
You won't be home
I saw an elsebound train
On the overpass
In the driving rain
Every ticket costs the same
For where you can't go
Mustang horses, champagne glasses
Anything frail anything wild
It's the price of living motion
What's beautiful is broken
And grace is just the measure of a fall
So I rolled into your town
I passed the smokestacks
And the ore docks down off of Main street
And the sky spun around
With her diamonds on fire
We fought all night and then we danced
In your kitchen
You were as much in my hands
As water or darkness or nothing
Can ever be held
Mustang horses, champagne glasses
Anything frail anything wild
It's the price of living motion
What's beautiful is broken
And grace is just the measure of a fall
It's just flashes that we own
Little snapshots
Made of breath and of bone
And out on the darkling plain alone
They light up the sky
It's 51 and driving south
Ain't it funny
How things'll turn out
I never even kissed you on the mouth
When we said goodbye
Mustang horses, champagne glasses
Anything frail anything wild
It's the price of living motion
What's beautiful is broken
And grace is just the measure of a fall

Marching in a slow parade
There are ashes where you lay

Find another horse to break
Your just a rider on a wheel
In a dream where love was real

'Cause looking around there's no sign of you.
I don't remember one jump or one leap,  
Just quiet steps away from your lead.
I'm holding my heart out but clutching it too,  
Feeling this sort of a love that we once knew.  
I'm calling this home when it's not even close,
Playing the role with nerves left exposed.
Standing on a darkened stage, stumbling through the lines.
Others have excuses, but I have my reasons why.
We get distracted by dreams of our own,  
But nobody's happy while feeling alone,
And knowing how hard it hurts when we fall,
We lean another ladder against the wrong wall.  
And climb high to the highest rung, to shake fists at the sky.
While others have excuses, I have my reasons why.
With so much deception it's hard not to wander away,  
It's hard not to wander away,

Who dropped his tools and his keys and left

Past the city and gated neighbourhoods
And he slept 'neath the stars
Wrote down what he dreamt
And he built a machine for no-one to see

And since the operation I heard you're breathing just for one
Now everything is imaginary, especially what you love
You left another message said it's done, It's done
When I hear beautiful music it's always from another time
Old friends I never visit, I remember what they're like
Standing on a doorstep full of nervous butterflies
Waiting to be asked to come inside  Just come inside
But I keep go-o-o-o-oing out
I can't sleep next to a stranger when I'm coming down
It's 8 a.m. my heart is beating too loud,  Too loud
Don't be-e-e-e so ama-a-a-azing or I'll miss you too much
I felt something that I had never touched
Everything gets smaller now the further that I go
Towards the mouth and the reunion of the Known and the Unknown
Consider yourself lucky if you think of it as home
You can move mountains with your misery if you don't, If you don't
It comes to me in fragments, even those still split in two
Under the leaves of that old Lime Tree I stood examining the fruit
Some were ripe and some were rotten, I felt nauseous with the truth
There will never be a time more opportune
So I just won't be late
The window closes, shock rolls over in a tidal wave
And all the color drains out of the frame
So pleased with a daydream that now living is no good
I took off my shoes and walked into the woods
I felt lost and found with every step I took

I'll return to you dreaming with each lullaby

As the cool evening shadows grow long
Angels and nightingales gather at night
Just to hear mother Anna Lee's song
I'll return to you, dear, in the dimming of day
As the sparrow returns to her nest
I'll return to you dreaming with each lullaby
Hold your sweet weary head to my breast
I heard it one morning she rode into town
To tend to her dear sister there
She kissed her two babies on cheek and on brow
And left them with nary a care
The wind it did rise and the rain it did fall
The river, a shadowy wave
Anna Lee never heard danger's dark call
And was swept to her watery grave

As the sparrow returns to her nest
I'll return to you dreaming with each lullaby
Hold your sweet weary head to my breast

He was nineteen in green with a new M-16 
Just doing what he had to do
He was dropped in the jungle where the choppers would rumble
With the smell of napalm in the air
And the seargent said
Look up ahead
Like a dark evil cloud twelve hundred came down
On him and twenty-nine more
They fought for their lives but most of them died
In the 173rd airborne
On the 8th of November the angels were crying 
As they carried his brothers away
With the fire raining down and the hell all around
There were few men left standing that day
Saw an eagle fly through a clear blue sky
Nineteen-sixty-five
the 8th of November
Now he's fifty-eight and his pony tail's gray
But the battle still plays in his head
He limps when he walks but he's strong when he talks
About the shrapnell they left in his leg
He puts on a suit over his airborne tatoo
He ties it on one time a year
He remembers the fallen as he orders a tall one
And swallows it down with his tears

--------------
There ain't a thing in the world to take me back
Like a dark-haired girl in a Cadillac
On main street of an old forgotten town
The sun light shines in fine white lines
On weathered stores with open signs
They may as well just close 'em down.
And you look like 1968 or was it '69
When I heard you caught a bullet
Well I guess you're doing fine
And you speak of revolution
Like it's some place that you've been
Well you've been a long time gone
Good too see you my old friend.
Oh now that sign is gone away
Replaced instead by silver age 
and moonlight falling on the avenue
Oh and I could sleep if you would drive
I just can't keep my mind alive
And you've got nothing better else to do
And we've all been looking for you
Like a hobo you walk in
Well how the mighty all have fallen
How the holy all have sinned
Is that the clattering of sabers
Or the cool September winds
Well you've been a long time gone
Good to see you my old friend.
And there's just two times a day like this
You find this kind of blissfulness
The sun it sets and rises in the morn
And we're shakin hands, I rub my eyes
Free up all my alibis
Just a blinking like the day I was born
And you look like 1968 or was it '69
When I heard you caught a bullet
Well I guess you're doing fine
And you speak of revolution
Like it's some place that you've been
Well you've been a long time gone
Good too see you my old friend.
And when the rounds were fired that April you were on the balcony
When ten thousand tear drops hit the ground in Memphis, Tennessee
You were a prideful rebel yell among a million marching men.
And you've been a long time gone
Good to see you my old friend
Well you've been a long time gone
Good to see you my old friend.

Catching raindrops on your tongue

And the winos wait into the bar rooms to drink away the dreams

Like my arms and my legs and my body and my soul and my will to speak
Now there just sliding fast towards that ocean floor beneath 
Trying to not be pulled under by the waves and the weeds
     Rain on the roof fit together so click like a tailor made suit
It’s like pull aim click bang soar and shoot

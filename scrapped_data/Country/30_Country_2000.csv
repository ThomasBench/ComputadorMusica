0,Days Go By (ver 3),Keith Urban,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/keith-urban/days-go-by-chords-2957861,"I'm changing lanes and talking on the phone
I'm driving way too fast
And the interstate's jammed with gunners like me
Afraid of coming in last
But somewhere in the race we run
Days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window in the wind
As the cars go by
Yeah, it's all we've been given
So you better start living right now
'Cause days go by, oh, ooh, ooh
Out on the roof just the other night
I watched the world flash by
Headlights, taillights running through a river of neon signs
But somewhere in the rush I felt
Days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window in the wind
As the cars go by
Yeah, it's all we've been given
So you better start living right now
And days go by, oh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, the days go by, oh, ooh, ooh
We think about tomorrow, then it slips away
We talk about forever but we've only got today
And the days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window
As the cars go by
It's all we've been given
So you better start living
You better start living
Cause' days go by
I can feel them flying
Like a hand out the window in the wind
As the cars go by
Yeah, it's all we've been given
So you better start living right now
And days go by, oh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, the days go by, oh, ooh, ooh
Oh, so take them by the hand
They're yours and mine
Take them by the hand
And live your life
Take them by the hand
Don't let them all fly by
Come on, come on now
Yeah, come on, oh, ooh, ooh
Don't you know the days go by?

Seven of us crammed into that truck of mine
Payin' no attention to them highway signs
Ninety mile an hour toward the county line
Quick sack, twelve pack, back again
Its a B - double E - double R - U - N
My buddies and their babies lettin' down their hair
As long as we're together it don't matter where
Ain't got a lot of money but we just don't care
Knowing that the fun is in the gettin' there
Aztec, long necks, paycheck spent
Oh its a B - double E - double R - U - N
I can't stop thinkin' what the Hell they were drinkin'
When they made this county dry
I got a week long thirst and to make it worse
Lord its my turn to drive
Oh laughin' and a braggin' and a carryin' on
We loaded up the wagons and we're headin' home
I guess half a dozen cases doesn't last that long
Come tomorrow morning it'll be all gone
And its turn around, leave town, sounds again

They call me at the all-night station, make their special dedications
And I do my best to play their request, when it's a desperate situation
This was a desperate situation
I'm Mr. Midnight alone and blue
The brokenhearted call me up when they don't know what else to do
Every song is a reminder, of the love that they once knew
I'm Mr. Midnight,      can I play a song for you?
""Caller on the line, could you please hold on?""
I recognized her voice the minute I picked up the phone
Should I tell her that it's me or leave it at a memory
Haven't been myself since the day she left and I'm never gonna be,
I'm forever gonna be
Mr. Midnight alone and blue
The brokenhearted call me up when they don't know what else to do
Every song is a reminder, of the love that they once knew
I'm Mr. Midnight,      can I play a song for you?
Imagine my surprise when she spoke my name
She said could you tell him that I love him and I wish things could be the same?
Then a voice I never knew, said ""Honey, who you talking to?""

with out no bridges she trapped so i sigh

soon forget the reason that your leaving
Loose yourself and then sometimes
Maybe you can save your self from grieving

Followed your love till love was in doubt
Followed your love till it never really was at all
Feeling stupid and hollow
Now the moon's gonna follow me home
Waited for you till the snow fell down
Over my skin like a thin nightgown
Waited for you but you never came around at all
Waited for you till they pulled the plug
Bartender emptied out his big tip jug
They swept all the floors
Vacuumed the rugs and went home
Drank all I can swallow
Now the moon's gonna follow me home
 Time go easy on me tonight
  I'm one of the lost sheep alright
Take what you must, take what you must
Of what I've lost as I have roamed
And let the moooooon follow me hoooome
Followed your tears with a washing pail
Followed your story followed your tale
Followed you straight through the doors 
of your jail cell too
Followed your voice in the darkness soft
A wind came through and carried it off
Followed your love till it never really was at all
Drank all I can swallow
Now the moon's gonna follow me home
Drank all I can swallow
Now the moon's gonna follow me home
Drank all I could swallow
Now the moon's gonna follow me home

I wished I could've stood, Where you would've been proud 
That won't happen now, That won't happen now

Don't have no guide to teach me no lessons

One night they called me for supper 
But I never got up, I stayed right there 
In my chair 
There's a whole lot of singing that's never gonna be heard 
Disappearing every day, Without so much as a word, Somehow  
And I think I broke the wings off that little songbird

All of the things I was on the inside  
But I'd pretend to be sleeping  
When you'd come in in the morning 
To whisper goodbye and go work at the rain 
I don't know why, Don't know why 
Cause everyone's singing we just wanna be heard 
Disappearing every day, without so much as a word, Somehow  
And I wanna grab a hold of that little songbird

but his dark eyes dared me with danger
and sparks fly like flame to a paper
fire in his touch burning me up
but Still I held on
cuz I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone
life is a runaway train you cant wait jump on
The last time I say him, we packed up my things
And he smiled like the first time he told me his name
And we cried with each other We split the blame
for the parts that we couldn't change
Pictures, dished and socks
It's our whole life down to one box
There he was waving goodbye on the front porch alone
But I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone
I was already gone
Hangout, make lots of noise
And layout late with a boy
Make the mistakes that she made, life is a runaway train
My mama mapped out the road that she knows
Which hands to shake, which hands you hold
In my hand-me-down Mercury
Life is a runaway train you can't wait to jump on

But we couldn't make us disappear.
Not a day goes by I don't wish I had you.
So in a way, I'm glad you're still here.
It's a bitter sweet victory.
Lovin' the ghost in front of me.
Now I-------- can't laugh, can't cry.
And I-------- can't run, can't hide.
What do I gotta do?
What do I gotta do to keep you?
What do I gotta do to keep you from doing this to me?
I wrote a couple of notes.
One in love, one in anger.
They're lying there dying in the dresser drawer.
Lived louder than my voice. 
Struggled through a stranger.
He loved me until I loved you even more.
It's a bitter sweet victory.
knowing someone else wanted me.
Now I-------- can't laugh, can't cry.
And I-------- can't run, can't hide.
You get used to the pain, and numb to the sting
Till you can't feel anything.
You tried to explain 
but I couldn't hear it.
As if your words were my tears.
Flowing freely, warm and quiet.
From the edges of my eyes and my ears.
Then all that disappears.
Now I-------- can't laugh, can't cry.
And I-------- can't run, can't hide.
Now I-------- can't laugh, can't cry.

And all that I want
Is to dig through this big box of pictures in my kitchen
This one here's my mama
With the long, brown hair
I'm forty years older today than she was in that picture there
But if life stayed they way it was
And lovers never fell out of love
If memories didn't last so long
If nobody did nobody wrong
If we knew what we had before it was gone
If every road led back home
This would be
The very last country song
These are all my babies
Lord knows how we survived
The first one was hard and the last was unplanned
That's him with his daddy's eyes
I love the man in this one
It's faded, but I don't care
There are nights when I wake up and know he's beside me, I swear
Sometimes I still feel him there
But if life stayed the way it was
And lovers never fell out of love

18,The Ride,Chris LeDoux,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/chris-ledoux/the-ride-chords-2368991,"I was six years old, my brother was ten
One July day came running in,
seen a ferris wheel at the edge of town
So, of course, we headed on down
Well it took us an hour to walk that far
Carrying our fortune in a Mason jar
It was all pretty sad, a cheap county fair
With a few old rides but there was ponies there
Well, the ponies stunk and the air was still
In that dusty circle behind the ferris wheel
This old guy smelling of smoke and rum
Swung me up and sat me down on one
Well I'd never rode a horse but I'd seen it done
    Cowboy movies made it look like fun
This old man whispered a few soft words
It was the best advice I've ever heard
He said ""Sit tall in the saddle, hold your head up high
Keep your eyes fixed where the trail meets the sky
And live like you ain't afraid to die
And don't be scared, just enjoy your ride""
I went up a kid with shaking hands
And I came down a full grown man
It was like he'd cast some Voodoo spell
Things were different for me now, I could tell
'Cos whenever troubles come wandering in
His rhyme would pop in my head again
And somehow I rode through the needles and nails
Brambles and thorns that life entails
He said ""Sit tall in the saddle, hold your head up high
Keep your eyes fixed where the trail meets the sky
And live like you ain't afraid to die
And don't be scared, just enjoy your ride""
Well I know some day farther down the road
I'll come to the edge of the great unknown
There'll stand a black horse riderless
And I wonder if I'm ready for this
So I'll saddle him up and he'll switch his tail
And I'll tip my hat and bid fairwell
And lift my song into the air
That I learned at that dusty fair
""Sit tall in the saddle, hold your head up high
Keep your eyes fixed where the trail meets the sky
And live like you ain't afraid to die
And don't be scared, just enjoy your ride""
Now don't be scared, just enjoy your ride

Take some rest as if not wicked. And walk around enjoying silence.
A world away, elders gather. Speaking their tongue and hardly falter.
With words of bound, joy and grievance, Simple songs, work and penance.
To drawn hate like a stone,
walk the path overgrown.
Never lie awake,
And so for goodness sake.
Well down the road the deer are crossing, And the grass is greener where they're walking.
Rattling beasts and heavy movements, Mark them now son before we lose them.
Bear your arms ever so wisely, Or burn them all if you have no need.
And dress to kill but kill so kindly. A hollow heart's too weak and weary.
To drawn hate like a stone,
walk the path overgrown.
Never lie awake,
And so for goodness sake.
Now call me crazy but all the old ways,
Of living simple are simply fading.
And all we buy is time before we die,
lay on down desensitized.
Love yourself to love your family, And find the difference between wants and needs.
Be sure to stop and count your blessings, Smell the roses and fight for something.
To drawn hate like a stone,
walk the path overgrown.
Never lie awake,
And so for goodness sake.
Now call me crazy but all the old ways,
Of living simple are simply fading.
And all we buy is time before we die,
lay on down 
And all we buy is time before we die,
lay on down desensitized.

""too young, for him!"" they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelling soldier,
Our love will never end,
Waiting for the soldier to come back again,
Never more to be alone,
When the letter says "" A soldier is coming

So the letters came from an army camp,
In california, then Viet-Nam,
And he told her of his heart: He might be in love,
And all the things he was so scared of
He said ""When it's getting kinda rough over here,
I think of that day sitting down at the peir,
And I close my eyes, and see your pretty 
Smile,
Now don't worry, but I won't be able to write for a while.
I cried
I'm never gonna hold the hand of another guy,
""too young, for him!"" they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelling soldier,
Our love will never end,
Waiting for the soldier to come back again,
Never more to be alone,
When the letter says "" A soldier is coming
Home""
One friday night at a football game,
The lord's prayer said, and the anthem sang,
And a man said ""Folk's, would you bow your head,
For I list a local, Viet-Nam Dead
Crying all alone, under the stand,
Was a piccolo player in the marching band
And one name read, and nobody really
cared,
But a prettly little girl, with a bow in her hair
I cried
I'm never gonna hold the hand of another guy,
""too young, for him!"" they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelling soldier,
Our love will never end,
Waiting for the soldier to come back again,
Never more to be alone,
When the letter says "" A soldier is coming...""
I cried,
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy,
""too young, for him!"" they told her
Waiting for the love of a travelling soldier,
Our love will never end,
Waiting for the soldier to come back again,

Stay, stay and watch the coals
till they cease to glow
like empty promises
Why, Why did you go, why did you go away?
Why, Why did you go, why did you go away?
Baby?
There's nothing I can say
Nothing I can do
To bring you back again
This of life I know is true
It's all a falling through
and so I reach for you
Why, Why did you go, why did you go away?
Why, Why did you go, why did you go away?
Don't you care
That it may seem unfair?
You steal things you ought to borrow
Don't you find
That it may seem unkind?
I'd rather breathe than drown in sorrow
Why, Why did you go, why did you go away?
Why, Why did you go, why did you go away?
Baby?

Cryin' into your sleeve
Cause you miss those lovin arms
Lullaby keeps on playin’
You thinking it’s a dream
Cause you miss those lovin’ arms
And you've gotta good mind to pray
They say it's all part of his plan
But what if he’s got slippery hands?
Cause it’s a sad face you're wearing
Like a burned out sun
Cause you miss those lovin’ arms
You think a grow man will care
'Bout his boot lace undone?
You just miss this lovin’ arms
Yeah you miss those lovin’ arms
And you've gotta good mind to pray
They say it's all part of his plan
But what if he’s got slippery hands?
God damn
You’re a boy not a man
When you miss those lovin arms
Someday 
when you’re up their flying
Cause you miss those lovin’ arms
It isn’t so far away
The sweet lullaby
When you miss those lovin’ arms

The truth is a bully and it'll slap you around
I know it can be
A pretty rough ride
When my true heart's kickin' my side
I was loaded, loaded
Proud to say I was loaded
Sometimes the tip of my tongue
Is the barrel of a gun
And it's loaded
All alone on my knee with my dreams of the past
But my aim is till true and my draw is still fast
My heart pulls the trigger
It doesn't wait
Who wants a heart that hesitates
I was loaded, loaded
Have to say I was loaded
Sometimes the tip of my tongue is the barrel of a gun
And it's loaded
Yeah the tip of my tongue
Is the barrel of a gun

bruised by every branch 
never landing on my feet on my feet
like a fool im willing

I have drawn too much
from that fountain of tears
and i drowned many times

I have spoke too much 
from a pipe made of bones
I will hide for awhile
then will tumble like a stone

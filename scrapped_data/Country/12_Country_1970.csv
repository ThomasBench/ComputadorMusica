Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this,can I baby?
He slipped the handcuffs on behind my back
They got'em all in the jailhouse baby
Ain't living long like this
Grew up in Houston off the wayside drives
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this,can I baby?
You know the story how the wheel goes 'round
Can't sleep at all in a jailhouse baby
Ain't living long like this
I live with Angel she's a roadhouse queen
Ain't living long like this
Can't live at all like this,can I baby?
You know the story about the jailhouse rock
They got'em all in the jailhouse baby
Ain't living long like this

4,Singing In Vietnam Talking Blues,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/singing-in-vietnam-talking-blues-chords-1067640,"One mornin' at breakfast I said to my wife,
""We've been ev'rywhere once and some places twice.""
As I had another helping of country ham, she said,
     ""We ain't never been to Vietnam,
And there's a bunch of our boys over there.""
So       we went to the Orient,     Saigon.
Well, we got a big welcome when we drove in
To the gates of a place that they call Long Ben.
We checked in and ev'rything got kind of quiet.
But a soldier boy said, ""Just wait till tonight.
Things get noisy, things start happenin'.
Big, bad firecrackers.""
Well, that night we did about four shows for the boys
And they were livin' it up with a whole lot of noise.
We did our last song for the night
And we crawled into bed for some peace and quiet.
But things weren't peaceful and things weren't      quiet.
Things were      scary.
Well, for a few minutes, June never said one word,
And I     thought at first that she hadn't heard.
Then a shell exploded not two miles away.
She sat up in bed and I heard her say,
""What was that?"" I said, ""That was a shell    or a bomb.""
She said, ""I'm scared."" I said, ""Me too"".
Well, all night long that noise kept on,
And the sound would chill you right to the bone.
The bullets and the bombs and the mortar shells
      Shook our bed ev'ry time one fell and it never let up.
It was gonna get worse     before it got any better.
Well, when the sun came up, the noise died down.
We got a few minutes sleep and we were sleepin' sound.
Then a soldier knocked on our door and said,
Last night they brought in 7 dead and 14 wounded.
And would we come down to the base hospital and see the boys.        Yeah.
So, we went to the hospital ward by day
     And ev'ry night we were singin' away.
Then the shells and the bombs till dawn again,
And the helicopters brought in the wounded men.
Night after night, day after day, comin' and goin'.
So, we sadly sang for them our last song
     And reluctantly we said, ""So long.""
We did our best to let 'em know that we care
For ev'ry last one of  'em that's over there.
Wether we belong over there or not,
Somebody over here loves 'em and needs 'em.
Well, now, that's about all that there is to tell
About that little trip into livin' hell.
And if  I ever go back over there anymore,
I hope there's none of our boys there for me to sing for.
I hope that war is over with
And they all come back home to stay           in peace.

I heard someone began to weep.
Then I got up, just to see
I heard my mother praying for me.
She was kneeling by her bed,
And tears of pain were being shed.
She said, 'Dear God, please hear my plea'.
I heard my mother praying for me.
I got my Bible and set out,
And in the Holy Book I found
The way to end this misery.
Thank God my mother prayed for me.
I read it on into the night,
And soon began to see the light
And now at last my soul is free.
Thank God my mother prayed for me

Said he was an officer   Saw some pictures in my room

As soon as he could, he drove off for good   His whole life was short, quick, and straight

Around this world 100 times   By bus, truck, train, bike , or car (???)

And the morning sun is always shining down on my back door.
And your laughter washes all my cares away.
And there's not a day goes by that I don't look up to the sky.
And humbly thank the good Lord up above.
For bringing you to me in time to make me realize,
that all a poor man really needs is love.

By the sparkle of your diamond face
On a gray spot with a little lace

In a meadow of columbine

What you've got on your mind
Seems like most of the time you're lying there dreaming 
Maybe in your vision you'll see how
Our mission is slightly less than divine
Cut the telephone line  The storys the same 
Now, rippling waters that flow through the ceiling
And the walls that are keepin me warm
And the closest Ive been to family for days Is my music 
But the silently stare in the morning sky
Is like hearing her calling my name

Goodbye you jaded lover, you undercover queen for a day.
And, I can see you are an angel, whose wings just won't unfold
Tune up your harp; and polish your old halo.
Yea, the only kind of man that you ever wanted
Was the one that you knew you'd never hold very long
Sittin' there cryin' like I'm the first one to go.
Tag: You're just sittin' there cryin' like I'm the first one to go.
(Spoken:) Think about it darlin.

Put your feet up, there's wine in a cup Its good to see you again
Haven't seen your smile for quite a while so just unwind, relax your mind
Let the time go by.
Let me see now I aint seen since while down in coconut grove
Except for the time we pick played one night but that was really no joke
Cause I got to drunk but hell I always played that way so aint nothin changed its still the same
So let the time go by
Say, how is your lady, She still just as crazy? What the hell was her name?
Remember the night we both got so tight We never did catch a plane?
We played guitar all night in that terminal, we had a ball, we played them all
And let the time go by.
You still live upstairs? Your cats are all there and your dozen guitars?
They say we all changed But I feel the same and I know that you are.
They always said we played 'em much too long. But what's a song, it carries on
and makes the time go by?
I live in the west, Texas, I guess old Austin's the best.
Iâm building a house Its a mile to the south the old bird's gonna nest.
The radio gonna play our songs sometimes and make me smile, erase some miles,
And make the time go by.
Yes it's a long old road that we ride down my friends.
Yes, it's a long old road that we ride.
But I know weâll make it through weâll make it to the end,
Yes, friends, we'll make it, you and I.

I used to let, these feelings pass me by

I've got no one, to leave them to me
 You see; I've traded love for what I thought, must be free
So I confess, (I confess) my loneliness (my loneliness)
And I guess, (and I guess) I've lost the best (lost the best) 
Of the years that I let love slippin' my fingers, like a golden breath of air
 If I cared; I wouldn't be singin' this love song of the year
I know that time cannot erase the days
Love is past and I've gone away
From now on, I'll make it very clear
 Coz' I don't wanna write, (I don't wanna write)

It's a lonely song (wishful? song) and not too clear (not too clear)
But to me, (but to me) it's very dear (very dear)
I guess this song could only be,
my feelings went out in the sea of love
 To me; This has got to be, the love song of the year

You don't have to call me Waylon Jennings
And you don't have to call me Charlie Pride
And you don't have to call me Merle Haggard...anymore

And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
'Cause I never minded standin' in the rain
You don't have to call me Darlin',  Darlin'
But you never even call me by my name
Well I've seen my name a few times in your phone book
And I've seen it on the signs where I've played
But the only time I know I'll hear ""David Allen Coe""
Is when Jesus has his final judgement day
And I'll hang around as long as you will let me
'Cause I never minded standin' in the rain
You don't have to call me Darlin',  Darlin'
But you never even call me by my name
Well I was drunk the day my Momma got out of prison
And I went to pick her up in the rain
But before I could get to the station in my pickup truck
My Momma, she got run over by a damned old train
So I'll hang around just as long as you will let me
'Cause I never minded standing in the rain
You don't have to call me darlin',  darlin'

The rest he got workin' on old junk cars in the daytime
They looked like tombstones in our yard
And I never seen him when he wasn't tired and mean
He sold used parts to make ends meet, covered with grease from his head to his feet
Cussin' the sweat and the Texas heat, and the skeeters
And the neighbors said we lived like hicks,
But they brung their cars for Pa to fix anyhow.
He was vet'ran proud, tried and true, he'd fight till his heart was black and blue,
Didn't know how he'd made it through, the hard times
He'd bought our house on the G.I. Bill,
But it wasn't worth all he had to kill to get it
He drank pearl in a can and Jack Daniels black, chewed tobacco from a mail-pouch sack,
Had an old dog that was trained to attack, sometimes
He'd get drunk and mean as a rattlesnake,
And there wasn't too much that he would take, from a stranger
There was 13 kids and a bunch of dogs, house full of chickens and a yard full of hogs,
Spent the summertime cuttin' up logs for the winter
Tryin' like the devil to find the lord, and workin' like a dog for my room and board,
Coal burnin' stove, no natural gas, and if that ain't country, I'll kiss your ass.
If that ain't country, it'll hairlip the pope,
If that ain't country, it's a damn good joke
I've seen the Grand Ole Opry and I met Johnny Cash,
And if that ain't country, I'll kiss your ass.
Momma sells eggs at a grocery store, my oldest sister is a first-rate whore,
Dad says she can't come home anymore, and he means it
Ma just sits and keeps her silence
Sister she left 'cause Dad got violent, and he knows it
Momma she's old, far beyond her time, from choppin' tobacco and I seen her cryin'
When blood started flowin' from her calloused hand, and it hurt me
But she'd just keep workin', tryin' to help the old man,
From the end of one row and back again, like always
She's been through hell since Junior went to jail, and when the lights go out she ain't never failed,
To get down on her knees and pray, 'cause she loves him
Told all the neighbors he was off in the war,
Fightin' for freedom, he's good to the core, and she's proud
Our place was a graveyard for automobiles, at the end of the porch there was 4 stacks of wheels,
And tires for sale for a dollar or two, cash
There was 50 holes in an old tin roof
Me and my family was livin' proof,
Of people who forgot about poor white trash
And if that ain't country I'll kiss your ass
If that ain't country, it'll hairlip the pope,
If that ain't country, it's a damn good joke
I've seen the Grand Ole Opry and I met Johnny Cash,
And if that ain't country, I'll kiss your ass.
I'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes
Concerning the great speckled bird
I didn't know god made honky-tonk angels
And went back to the wild side of life

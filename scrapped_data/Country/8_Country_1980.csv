All this talk is really useless
You run for cover
Everytime Im close to you
Ooo, youve seen it all before  (Oo-oos)
And heard the same lines,
But if youre willing just to take a chance  (Oo-oos)
It could be all right, so fine
Well find ourselves dancing by firelight.
Ooh, to the blue skies
Where no one can reach us
It may sound crazy but just hold on tight,
Never has a love run deeper
Baby my heart is true
Baby my heart is true  (diff singer)

1,1959,John Anderson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-anderson/1959-chords-2109757,"  Cigarettes were a quarter then, 
  bobby socks and jeans were in, 
Elvis sang the songs that we loved so, 
and the most important thing to us
 was keeping gas in my old truck, 
   so I could take us to the drive-in show.
  Then graduation finally came, 
  Uncle Sam called me away, 
you married someone else while I was gone, 
but I've kept your letter all these years
  and I can't help but shed a tear, 
when I read the words you wrote me years ago.
Baby I'm yours,    I'll love you always, 
I'm gonna stand by you until the end of time,
remember all of the good things   that we shared together

  I never will forget the day, 
when you and I went all the way,
I was the first for you,
and you for me,
I've still got the truck that we loved in

back to fifty nine in my memory.

She wants to grab her telephone, but she knows it ain't right.
So if he won't call, she'll survive, and if he don't care, she'll get by
Climb into bed, bury her head, and cry.
From the beginning he was all anyone could have been.
They were delirious with love; they were certain to win.
Now he's breaking plans more and more, and he's leaving notes on her door.
Took a trip out of town, couldn't turn this one down;
He said, ""I guess I should have told you before.""
She says she feels like she's addicted to a real bad thing,
Always sitting, waiting, wondering if the phone will ring,
She knows she bounces like a yo-yo when he pulls her string,
It hurts to feel like such a fool.
She wants to tell him not to call or come around again,
He doesn't need her now at all the way that she needs him.
She's on the edge about to fall from leaning out and in,
And she don't know which way to move.
     She wants to be fair; she couldn't say he was ever unkind,
But if she could bear to walk away, she thinks he wouldn't mind
'Cause he just keeps himself so apart and there's no one else in her heart,
So she's taking a dive from an emotional high and coming down hard.
She says she feels like she's addicted to a real bad thing,
Always sitting, waiting, wondering if the phone will ring,

And remember how holding them made me not feel so alone,
Then I feel you beside me and even their memories are gone,
And like stars in the night lost in the sweet light of dawn.

There's a least a million love songs that people love to sing
And everyone is different and everyone's the same

She visits my grave when the night winds wail

Nobody knows but me        
The scaffold is high and eternity's near

But sometimes at night, when the cold wind moans 
In a long black veil, she cries o'er my bones 
She walks these hills in a long black veil 
She visits my grave when the night winds wail 
Nobody knows, nobody sees 
Nobody knows but me
The judge said son, what is your alibi 
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die 
I spoke not a word, al-tho' it meant my life 
For I'd been in the arms of my best friend's wife 
She walks these hills in a long black veil 
She visits my grave when the night winds wail 
Nobody knows, nobody sees 
Nobody knows but me
Nobody knows, nobody sees 
Nobody knows but me

He was ten and it was nineteen fifty-two
His daddy worked hard from sun up to sun down 
and the going got tuff 'hind them old grey mules
The farm grew to be a money maker
and the house he lived in grew up room by room
The boy worked hard but soon got tired of farming
So he slipped away one night beneath the harvest moon.
His neck was red as Alabama clay
but the cities call pulled him away
He's got a factory job and runs a big machine
He don't miss the farm or the fields of green.
Now the cities just a prison without fences.
His job is just a routine he can't stand
and at night he dreams of wide open spaces 
fresh dirt beneath his toes and on his hands.
Then one day a picture came inside a letter
of a young girl with a baby in her arms.
And the words she wrote would change his life forever.
So he went to raise his family on their farm.
His neck is red as Alabama Clay
Now he's going home this time to stay
Where the roots run deep on the family tree
and the tractor rolls through the fields of green.
His neck is red as Alabama Clay
Now he's going home this time to stay
Where the roots run deep on the family tree

And Flied across the sky

Of the days gone gone by
And trailin behind
Is a horse with no rider

Did I try in every way to show her every day
That she's my only one
And if my time on earth were through
And she must face this world without me
Is the love I gave her in the past
Gonna be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes
'Cause I've lost love ones in the life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret
That my true feelings for them never were revealed
So I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where there's no second chance to tell her how I feel
So tell that someone that you love
Just what you`re thinking of
If tomorrow never comes

Where I go when my troubles pull me down.
And all the lies I know they'll tell, and the time that they will sell me,
For a while I'll be the biggest man in town
Back at home in bed she's crying, for her love for me is dying.
But she'll pray I make it safely through the night.
When the morning sun starts showing, to her bedside I'll be going,
And she'll hold me while I face the morning light.
And I'll make promises, Promises to change.
I'll make her promises, swear I'll rearrange,
And I'll start giving all the love she needs If only she will stay…
And once again she'll reassure me, and I believe her love will cure me.
And I'll fall asleep with tears on my face.
And I know she's just a woman, and her love can't last forever.
And someday soon, I know she'll leave without a trace.
For broken promises will tear her dreams apart.
Just token promises will someday break her heart,
And for the last time, she'll hold me when I cry,
And while I'm sleeping she'll quietly say goodbye…

45,Johnny Come Lately,Steve Earle,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/steve-earle/johnny-come-lately-chords-67651,"I'm an American, boys, and I've come a long way
I was born and bred in the USA
So listen up close, I've got something to say
Boys, I'm buying this round
Well it took a little while, but we're in this fight
And we ain't going home 'til we've done what's right
We're gonna drink Camden Town dry tonight
If I have to spend my last pound
When I first got to London it was pourin' down rain
Met a little girl in the field canteen
Painted her name on the nose of my plane
Six more missions I'm gone
Well I asked if I could stay and she said that I might
Then the warden came around yelling ""turn out the lights""
Death rainin' down in the London night
We made love 'til dawn
But when Johnny Come Lately comes marching home
With a chest full of medals and a G.I. loan
They'll be waitin' at the station in San Antone
When Johnny comes marching home
My P-47 is a pretty good ship
And she took a round comin' 'cross the channel last trip
I was thinkin' 'bout my baby and letting her rip
Always got me through so far
Well they can ship me all over this great big world
But I'll never find nothing like my North End girl
I'm taking her home with me one day, sir,
Soon as we win this war
But when Johnny Come Lately comes marching home
With a chest full of medals and a G.I. loan
They'll be waitin' at the station in San Antone
When Johnny comes marching home
Now my granddaddy sang me this song
Told me about London when the blitz was on
How he married Grandma and brought her back home,
A hero throughout his land
Now I'm standin' on a runway in San Diego
A couple purple hearts and I move a little slow
There's nobody here, maybe nobody knows
About a place called Viet - nam
But when Johnny Come Lately comes marching home
With a chest full of medals and a G.I. loan
They'll be waitin' at the station in San Antone
When Johnny comes marching home

   I read some old love letters right up 'til the break of dawn
   Yeah I've been sittin' alone diggin' up bones
   Then I went through the jewelry and I found our wedding rings
   Across crossed this lonely bedroom of our recent broken home
   Yeah tonight I'm sittin' alone diggin' up bones
   I'm diggin' up bones, I'm diggin' up bones
   Exhuming things that's better left alone
   I'm resurrecting memories of love that's dead and gone
   Yeah tonight I'm sittin' alone diggin' up bones
   And I went to the closet and I found some things in there
   And I recall how good you looked each time you had it on

While traveling through this world of woe
Yet there's no sickness toil nor danger
In that bright world to which I go
I'm going there to see my Father
I'm going there no more to roam
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm only going over home
I know dark clouds will gather round me
I know my way is rough and steep
Yet beauteous fields rise before me
Where Gods redeem their vigil's keep
I'm going there to see my mother
She said she'd meet me when I come
I'm only going over Jordan
I'm only going over home

And don't close your eyes

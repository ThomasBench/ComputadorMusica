1,Rock And Roll Found Me,Eric Church,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/eric-church/rock-and-roll-found-me-chords-3674147,"I was a skinny little white kid
Wrong side of the track kid
Don’t do that kid
What the hell is wrong with him kid
No my rebel never run,and my damn gave one
I was just a boulder on a shoulder in a
cul-de-sac dead-end street
And rock and roll found me
Like my faith, like my church
My low like my high
The better in my worse
Come on baby “Light My Fire”
Like a needle in my vein
The crazy in my sane
I turned on my amps and all at once my blind could see
Yeah when rock and roll found me                              D
I was a nowhere new town
Do what your daddy do town
Don’t dream big town
Born to get outta this town, town
So I went looking for a reason
Hunting outta season
Crashed into some freedom
On a levee at a break neck speed
When rock and roll found me
Like my faith, like my church
My low like my high
The better in my worse
Come on baby “Light My Fire”
Like a needle in my vein
The crazy in my sane
I turned on my amps and all at once my blind could see
Yeah when rock and roll found me
I was a laid-back caddy, rolling cool through the alley, heading for disaster
When a black man’s guitar stopped me at the edge
And sang Billy Jo McAlister
jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge
Like my faith, like my church
My low like my high
The better in my worse
Come on baby “Light My Fire”
Like a needle in my vein
The crazy in my sane
I turned on my amps and all at once my blind could see
Yeah when rock and roll found me
I was a skinny little white kid
Wrong side of the track kid
No don’t do that kid
When rock and roll found me

There's never a seat left in the life boat

And if you could bury me deep
Believe that from the darkness something will emerge

We swallow swords and we fight wild fires

So I cover my eyes
And I wait for the light to change
And I think about you
And it's kinda strange
But I think about you
Sitting in the backseat
Of a downton taxi
Speeding across New York City
Somewhere between First Avenue and Second Street
I think about you
It's like a heartbeat
I think about you
In stolen moments
You're riding with me
You're riding with me again
You're riding with me
In stolen moments
You're riding with me again
You're riding with me again

I look out in wonder
At a rainbow through the clouds
Thirty thousand feet in the air
I swear you're with me there
Like a prayer you're with me there

Somewhere, dawn, the stores are closed out by the beach
I could spray paint your name, no one would see
I reduce you to the poison in the bottom of my cup
'Til it washes all my worries out to sea
And my demons, that got so bored of dreamin'
My demons, alcohol and freedom
A King without a Queen
A King without a kingdom
I was so bad on my own
Drawing maps inside my soul to places where nobody goes
Woke up confused, just staring at my telephone
Waiting like I'd ever hear your voice again
I feel that empty low
Sometimes it is so jagged, I don't know what love is for
Alone like I don't know how to survive and insane
'Til I cannot tell the poison from the pain
I used to think that you were me
Pretending every sentence from your mouth was melody
A tune so turbulent that it cracked open every key
'Til everything was broken that I played
Your father stood and cried
On the day your brother married someone that he could rely on
No one could heal his heart, whoever made you cry
So I became the poison and the pain
And my demons, they got so bored of dreamin'

And the rest of my family

As we laid in the sun I could see your eyes
Blue as the blue in that Southern sky
Kisses warm as a wild red rose
At the bend in the river where the cottonwood grows
And we'd dance
And we'd sing
And we'd love each other as the pale moon glows
At the bend in the rivеr where the cottonwood grows
At thе bend in the river where the cottonwood grows
I can still recall the words you said
And the plans we dreamed as we looked ahead
But the fork in the river took us separate ways
As the years went by, I can't forget those days
And I often wonder but I'll never know
If we ended up followin' a different road
Would we still be layin' by the wild red rose?
At the bend in the river where the cottonwood grows
And we'd dance
And we'd sing
And we'd love each other as the pale moon glows

Watchin' TV and drinkin' beer
And I said, ""What the hell happened to you, boy
That you wound up in here?""

And how it all got tough with the money and love

Set the bottle down on the bar

I'd put my foot in the boot
Put the boot in the truck
Put the truck in the road
And go home to her
Well, he told me it was complicated
And I just shook my head
I said, ""You wanna see hard, try livin' in bars
Your whole life tryin' to forget""

And buddy, you better believe
I wouldn't be sittin' here talkin' to you

Put the boot in the truck
Put the truck in the road

47,Out Of The Blue,The Steel Woods,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-steel-woods/out-of-the-blue-chords-3711545,"I'm not sure what has changed
Since yesterday
But the birds are singing a new tune
I've finally come out of the blue
I've finally come out of the blue
These eyes in the mirror
Look so much clearer
It's hard to believe that it's true
I've finally come out of the blue, Lord
I've finally come out of the blue
I've seen red, I've seen white
I've seen death, I've seen life
I never saw myself coming through
I've finally come out of the blue, Lord
I've finally come out of the blue
It's dark as a well
Down there in hell
Where everything reminds me of you
But I've finally come out of the blue, Lord
I've finally come out of the blue
I've seen red, I've seen white
I've seen death, I've seen life
But I never saw myself coming through
I've finally come out of the blue, Lord
I've finally come out of the blue, yeah
The writing of a song
Thin air becomes something new
I've finally come out of the blue
I've finally come out of the blue, Lord
I've finally come out of the blue, Lord
I've finally come out of the blue

49,Old At Heart,Jesse Daniel,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jesse-daniel/old-at-heart-chords-3718079,"  I work this room on Tuesday nights
It isn't much, but it pays all right
From nine p.m. until last call
Sometimes I'm playin' to the walls
But then there's nights I come alive
The stage, it completes my thin disguise
I just keep runnin' from myself
Playin' the song and be somebody else
Because I'm old at heart
And the people listenin' to me in the bars
They see the youth that's in my eyes
But if they saw the man inside
They'd know my soul was gray and worn
Cut from a cloth that's stained and torn
Unraveled from the single thread
With too many words I left unsaid
And I know I don't look the part
This young man, he's old at heart
   Words that come out of my mouth
They have a tired tone, but they're my own
  And I've lived a thousand lives
That no one will ever see
So let 'em be or set 'em free
Because I'm old at heart
And the people listenin' to me in the bars
They see the youth that's in my eyes
But if they saw the man inside
They'd know my soul was gray and worn
Cut from a cloth that's stained and torn
Unraveled from the single thread
With too many words I left unsaid
And I know I don't look the part
This young man, he's old at heart
And I know I don't look the part
This young man, he's old at heart

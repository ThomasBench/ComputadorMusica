Then I trimble, at the though of giving in
Because I know, how much it cost, to love you
And I'm so afraid of losing you again
Being close to you, revive the sorrow
That wakes me up, and tells me, I can't win
I'd love to wake, up in your arms tomorrow
But I'm so afraid of losing you again
If heaven were, to hear my hearts confession
Wanting you, would be my, greatest sin
But I'm glad your no longer, my pos- ses-sion
Cause I'm so afraid, of losing you again
But I'm so afraid of losing you again

Oh my, my, my-
In a dusty caravan was a girl with a golden tan
And she asked me if I was headed to the east
I politely stepped aside and said I did not need a ride
That I'd rather take my chances with the heat
Well, when she turned and walked away I saw my big mistake
There were jewels on her body oh-so-rare
Had it been another day I just might have rode away
With that woman riding off to God-knows-where
So the years they came and went, and found me living in a tent
Far above a little marble stream
And it may have been the light that shone out through the night
That attracted the hand scratching on my screen
When I cautiously looked out through the night there was no doubt
That the owner of that hand was that girl
So I bid her do come in and I'll open up a tin
If you'll tell me 'bout your trip around the world
Well, she said, ""If you think back to the first time that we passed
I'm sure you'll picture me in all my jewels
It was shortly after then that I ran into another man
And I asked him the same question I asked you
But now he, he didn't refuse and he took off of both his shoes
And climbed aboard my east-bound caravan
In the twinkling of the night he knocked me off the side
And left me there for dead upon the sand
And I thought I was done, lying naked in the sun
When much to my surprise, who should pass?
But this old friend of yours, he said he knew you from the wars
And I told him that I thought you'd headed west
Well, he said he should have known, 'cause you like to be alone
And that's the time I knew you were my one
So I asked him for a ride, just to get here by your side
And stay here above this stream out of the sun""
Well, we sat quiet for a while
And I began to smile
And I said well it's strange but I don't care
And some nights when I'm at rest, I wonder if I'd said, ""yes""
If she'd have come to me from God knows where
Or would I have been the one to leave her lying in the sun
And then ended up with only precious stones
Or would the woman in my arms be giving me her charms
If the answer that I gave her wasn't ""no""

But I can see the clouds are gathering and the storm will wreck our home

This is true for I was watching from the window up above
You must have thought that I was sleeping  - and I wish that I had been
But it's best to get to know you and the way your heart can sin
I thought we belonged to-gether and our hearts fit like a glove
But I was wrong for I was watching  from the window up above
From my eyes the teardrops started as I listened on and on
Heard you whisper to him softly that our marriage was all wrong
But I hope he makes you happy  and you'll never lose his love
I lost mine while I was watching from the window up above
How I wished I could be dreaming and wake up to a love that's true
But I can't for I was watching from the window up above

that my body would blacken

And I'd look from the door
of my heavenly home
and pity the miner
diggin my bones

33,Yesterday When I Was Young (ver 2),Roy Clark,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/roy-clark/yesterday-when-i-was-young-chords-3590348,"[Spoken]It seems the love I've known
Has always been the most destructive kind
I guess that's why now
I feel so old
Before my time
Yesterday when I was young
the taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
the way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned
I always built alas on weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of the day
and only now I see how the years ran away
Yesterday when I was young
so many happy songs were waiting to be sung,
so many wild pleasures lay in store for me
and so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think what life was all about
and every conversation I can now recall
concerned itself with me and nothing else at all
Yesterday the moon was blue
and every crazy day brought something new to do
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
and never saw the waste and emptiness beyond
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
and every flame I lit   too quickly quickly died
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
and only I am left on stage to end the play
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
The time has come for   me to pay for yesterday when I was young

Out on the new   horizon, you may see
the floating motions of a 
distant pair of wings.
And if the sleep has left your ears
you might hear footsteps running 
through an open meadow.
Don't be concerned, 
it will not harm you.
It's only me pursuing something 
I'm not sure of.
Across my dreams,   with nets of wonder.
I chase the bright elusive 
butterfly of love.

Echo softly in the distance through 
the canyons of your mind.
I might have even called your name
as I ran searching after something 
to believe in.
You might have seen me running. 
Through the long abandoned ruins of 
the dreams you left behind.
If you remember something there
that glided past you followed 
close by heavy breathing.

There?s a sayin? goin? round
I began to think it?s true
It?s awful hard to love someone
when they don?t care about you.
Once I had a lovin? gal
sweetest little thing in town
Now she?s done and left me
laud she?d done turned me down
Now, I ...ain't got no-bod -y, and nobody cares for me.
That's why I'm sad and lone-ly,
Won't somebody come and take a chance with me?
I?ll  Sing you love songs, honey, all the time,
If you'll be that lovin? momma of mine,
Cause  I ...ain't got no-bod- y, and nobody cares for me!
I?ll  Sing you love songs, honey, all the time,

1,Queen Of My Double Wide Trailer,Sammy Kershaw,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/sammy-kershaw/queen-of-my-double-wide-trailer-chords-2260203,"Well, I met her out at Murphy's Restaurant
She said she was fresh from the farm
And I remember thinkin' for a country girl
That she went pretty well armed
We sat there talkin' by the lobster tank
I ordered her a sloe gin fizz
And when the chicken fried steaks arrived
She said I like living like this.
So I made her the queen of my double wide trailer
With the polyester curtains and the redwood deck
Sometimes she runs and I got to trail her
dang her black heart and her pretty red neck.
A few nights later I run into her
with some stranger on a park bench
she said he rebuilds engines and his name is Earl
he's the Charlie Daniels of the torque wrench
I whispered honey let's just go on home
and have some onion rings and watch TV
and as I walked her to the truck
Earl was cryin' don't you leave me  I told him
this here's the queen of my double wide trailer
With the polyester curtains and the redwood deck
Sometimes she runs and I got to trail her
dang her black heart and her pretty red neck.

The jocks and their girls, it was their world, I didn't fit in.
Mama said, ""Baby, it's the best school that money can buy,
Be strong, hold your head up,  c'mon Mary, try.""
I stole mama's car on a Sunday and left home for good,
Moved in with my friends in the city, in a bad neighborhood.
Charles was a dancer, he loved the ballet,
And Kimmy sold pot and read Keroac and Hemmingway.
Drag Queens in Limousines
Nuns in blue jeans
Dreamers with big dreams
All took me in
Charly and I flipped burgers to cover the rent
And Bourbons at Happy hour for .35 cents
One day before work we got drunk and danced in the rain
They fired us both, They said, ""Don't ya'll come back here again.""
Drag Queens in Limousines
Nuns in blue jeans
Dreamers with big dreams
All took me in
My daddy went to college, and he worked for the state
He never quit nothing and he wanted me to graduate.
My brother and sister both play in the marching band
They tell me they miss me, but I know they don't understand.
Sometimes you got do, what you gotta do
And pray that the people you love, will catch up with you.

Nuns in blue jeans
Dreamers with big dreams
Poets and AWOL marines
Actors and Bar Flys
Writers with Dark Eyes
Drunks that Philosophize

The Devil walked up and said, ""You don't need no lightning rod
It hardly ever rains down here; I can't recall the last storm
You ain't gonna need that leather jacket, it gets kinda warm
There's one way, there's no way out; looks like you're here to stay
Oh, the place is a mess, it's overcrowded, more are coming everyday.""
I said, ""Aw, man, wait a minute, there's got to be somethin' wrong
I ain't a bad guy, I just write these little songs
I always pay my union dues, I don't stay in the passing lane.""
And he said, ""What about all that whisky and cocaine?""
I said, ""Well, yeah... but that's no reason to throw me in hell
'Cause I didn't use the cocaine to get high, I just like the way it smells.""
He said, ""Come on over here, son, let me show you around
Over there's where we put the preachers -- I never liked those clowns
They're always blaming me for everything wrong under the sun
It ain't that hard to do what's right, it's just maybe not as much fun
Then they walk around thinkin' they're better than me and you
And then they get caught in a motel room, doin' what they said not to do
""Now all the murderers and the rapists, they go in this fiery lake
As well as most of the politicians and the cops on the take
And all the mothers who wait 'til they get to K-Mart to spank their kids;
Instead of showin' 'em what to do what's right, they just hit 'em for what they did
And all the daddy's who run off and abandon their daughters and sons
Oh, anybody who hurts a child's gonna burn until it's done.""
""Everyone is down here,"" I said, ""who's up in heaven with God and the Son?""
""Oh, some saints and mystics and students of Metaphysics 101
People who care and share and love and try to do what's right
Beautiful old souls who read little stories to their babies every night
What you won't find up in heaven are Christian Coalition right-wing conservatives, country program
""Now,"" I said, ""I've made some mistakes, but I'm not as bad as those guys
How can God do this to me?, or can't she sympathize?""
He said, ""You're wrong about God being cruel and mean
Oh, God is the most loving thing that's never been seen.""
I said, ""Hot Shot, tell me this: which religion is the truest?""
Well, I thought about my future, I didn't seem to have much of one
I looked around to leave but there was... no place to run
I said, ""I don't suppose I could go back and try livin' again...
Like reincarnation, I hear that's the way it's always been.""
""I can't answer that,"" he said, ""you're gonna have to wait for that response
But it ain't any more unusual to be born twice than it is to be born once.""
Well it looked like I was gonna be stuck here, as far as I could tell
I thought I might as well suck up, you know, what the hell?
I said, ""You know that song that Charlie Daniels did?
About how you went down to Georgia and played fiddle against that kid?""
He said, ""Yeah, broke my heart but, you know, what're you gonna do?""
I said, ""To be honest, I thought your solo was the better of the two.""
Well, then I woke up, and I was lyin' in my bed
I went upstairs and kissed my little boy on his sleepin' head
I took this dream as a sign from God, so I thought I'd better pray:
""Don't ever speak to me directly, and thanks anyway.""
Now so much has changed about me besides me just givin' up red meat
Some get spiritual 'cause they see the light

And you've been in some trouble since we went our separate ways
We'll have to say hello maybe some other time instead
Cause you're wanted by the police
And my wife thinks you're dead
Somebody spread the rumor, that you had lost your life
Now here you're showing up again and talk is getting round
And I can see that one of us will have to leave this town
If you think that I want trouble than you're crazy in your head
'Cause you're wanted by the police
And my wife thinks you're dead
You never called or wrote me, just up and disappeared
Now troubles what you're lookin' like cause troubles where you been
And I can see the kind of trouble you could get me in
You better pay attention to every word I said
Cause you're wanted by the police
And my wife thinks you're dead
So goodbye to you baby, I'm glad we got to talk
I don't know where you're headed for but I know where you been

Go find another ex sweetheart to hang around instead

Step in and out of the light

She bought supper and she paid for the room
And as best as I can remember
She paid dearly for loving me too
She said hey don't I know you
Now ain't you the one
The one with the guitar boys
And all them sad songs
About men in the rain
Did you ever miss a plain
In Memphis
We laughed at the strangers we were in the bed
Two cigarettes lit up the room
Like two backseat lovers can't wait to get started
Knowing everything's over too soon
Now Memphis ain't bad in the morning
Good coffee well it's just hard to find

With anything on your mind

And throw the dirt over me.

A light has been seen on top of old Brown Mountain
A mystery noone can explain
High on a mountain.
And down in the valley below
And fades as the winds come and go.
Way over yonder
And night afer night until dawn
That fathful Slave can back from his grave
Searching, Searching, Searching
for his master Who’s Long Gone On.
In The Days Of The Old Covered Wagons
Where They Stopped On The Flats For The Nights
With The Noon Shining Dim, On The Old Canyon Rim
They’d Watch For That Brown Mountain Light
High on a mountain.
And down in the valley below
And fades as the winds come and go.

And night afer night until dawn

Many Years Ago A Southern Planter
Came Hunting In This Wild World Alone
And Then So They Say, The Hunter Lost His Way
And Never Returned To His Home
His Trusty Old Slave Brought A Lantern
And Searched, But In Vain, Day And Night
Now The Old Slave Is Gone, But His Spirit Lingers On
And The Old Lantern Still Casts It’s Light
High on a mountain.
And down in the valley below
And fades as the winds come and go.
Way over yonder
And night afer night until dawn
That fathful Slave can back from his grave
Searching, Searching, Searching
for his master Who’s Long Gone On.

Sat a bunch of fellows telling yarns to pass the time away
They told of places where they'd been and different things they'd seen
Some preferred Chicago town while others New Orleans
In the corner in an old armchair sat a man whose hair was gray
He sat and listened eagerly to what they had to say
They asked him where he'd like to be, his clear old voice did ring
""I'd like to be in Texas when they round-up in the Spring"".
I see the cattle grazing o'er the hills at early morn
I see the campfires smokin at the breaking of the dawn
I hear the bronco's neighing I can hear the cowboy sing
I'd like to be in Texas when they round-up in the spring.
Now, they sat and listened carefully to each word he had to say
They knew the old man sitting there had been a top hand in his day
So they asked him for a story of his life out on the plains
Slowly he removed his hat, quietly began.
I've seen 'em stampede o'er the hills till you'd think they'd never stop
I've seen em run for miles and miles until their leaders dropped
I was a foreman of a cow ranch, oh the callin' of a king
I'd like to be in Texas when they round-up in the Spring.
I can see the cattle grazing o'er the hills at early morn
I can see the campfires smokin at the breaking of the dawn
I can hear the bronco's neighing I can hear the cowboy sing
I'd like to be in Texas when they round-up in the Spring.
Now there's a place in sunny Texas where Molly Demming sleeps
Beneath a grove of mossy live oaks, a constant vigil keeps
And in my heart a recollection of a long, long bygone day
When we rode the range together like truent kids astray
Now her gentle spirit calls me in the watches of the night
And I hear her laughter freshening the dew of early light
As I was foreman of a cow ranch oh, the callin' of a king,
I'd like to be in Texas when they roundup in the Spring
I'd like to sleep my last long sleep with mother earth for bed
And my saddle for a pillow, and the bright stars overhead
Then I could hear the last stampedes, the songs the rivers sing
Way back down in Texas when they round-up in the spring.

Cruising the strip on a Saturday night
I smile and I wave and I hide all my pain
but the sign on my bumper gives me away:
Honk if you're lonely tonight
If you need a friend to get through the night
A toot on your horn, a flash of your brights
Honk if you're lonely tonight
I know honky-tonk where we can go
A booth in the back with the lights way down low
The jukebox is playing a sad melody
for heart-broken lovers like you and me
We'll laugh and we'll flirt and we'll dance every dance
and before the night's over we'll make romance
The morning will find us with a smile on our face
and we'll be together in a lover's embrace.
Honk if you're lonely tonight
If you need a friend to get through the night
A toot on your horn, a flash of your brights
Honk if you're lonely tonight
I know it seems sad to be so damn blue
but there's always the chance that you'll meet someone new
I know that somewhere waiting for me
is a sad lonely lover with a bumper that reads
Honk if you're lonely tonight
If you need a friend to get through the night
A toot on your horn, a flash of your brights

Most wars end in the fall

When your pet will go

It hits you slow

There was one created before him

The body grows weak and the spirit grows numb
When these things beset us, He doesn't forget us
He sends down His love on the wings of a dove
On the wings of a snow-white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above
On the wings of a dove
When Noah had drifted on the flood many days
He searched for land in various ways
Troubles, he had some, but was not forgotten
He sent down His love on the wings of a dove
On the wings of a snow-white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above
On the wings of a dove
When Jesus went down to the river that day
He was baptized in the usual way
And when it was done, God blessed his son
He sent him his love on the wings of dove
On the wings of a snow-white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above
On the wings of a dove
Yes, a sign from above
On the wings of a dove

So bright and so fair
When I entered the gates I cried holy
The angels all met me there
They showed me from mansion to mansion
And oh the sights I saw
But I said I want to see Jesus
The one who died for all
Then I bowed on my knees and cried
Holy (holy) holy (holy) holy (holy)
I clapped my hands and sang Glory (Glory)
Glory to the Son of God
I thought as I entered that city
My friends knew me well
They showed me the streets of heaven
The sights are too numerous to tell
I saw Abraham Isaac Jacob
Mark Luke and Timothy

Father took me by the hand
down through the rocks and driftwood
and pirate gold from Five+ Dime
He caused me to discover
all in a morning's wonder
Tonight I will fly to the top of the world
Ancient winds will guide me
down the old dim trails to the buffalo range
the little wolves beside me

There I see the pony herds
and the rires of the whiskey traders
and the golden dust hangs in the air
with the screams of the Blackwood raiders
with thr screams of the Blackfood raiders

I've been standing in the dark
I want someone to show me the way
I'm lost on a lonely road
There must be a light
At the end of the tunnel
Before I go out of control
I wanna fall in love
I wanna feel that rush
Running into my heart
Shaking up my soul
Feeling like I've never felt before
I wanna fall in love
I wanna feel that touch
I've only dreamed about it
I've been living without it
And that ain't good enough
I wanna fall in love
Somewhere out there
Someone else is searching like me
And I know he must be hurting
Maybe tonight he's walking down
The same road I've been taking
And we'll meet up without even talking
And he'll know what I'm saying

I wanna feel that rush

Shaking up my soul

Too much to think about
Too much to figure out
Stuck between hope and doubt
It's too much to think about

64 percent of all the world's statistics are made up right there on the spot
82.4 percent of people believe 'em whether they're accurate statistics or not

I need another double shot of something 90 proof

They say 92 percent of everything you learned in college was just bullshit you'll never 
need
84 percent of everything you got you bought to satisfy your greed
Because 90 percent of the world's population links possessions to success
Even though 80 percent of the wealthiest 1 percent of the population
Drinks to an alarming excess
Too much to think about
Too much to figure out
Stuck between hope and doubt
It's too much to think about
74 percent of all statisticians truly hate their fucking jobs
They say the average bank robber lives within about 20 miles of the bank that 
he robs 
There's this little bank not far from here that I've been watching now for a

Lately all I can think about is how bad I wanna go out in style

Never stops to turn and wonder why it goes
And you don't have to tell me when you're leaving

Leave now while you can
I'm not your man

To have your things and wait there for a plane ride
No one there to sit and hold your hand in flight

Even those that have someone to lie beside at night
Leave me with the dawn

Sing a song with a friend
Change the shape that I'm in
And get back in the game
And start playing again
I'd like to stay but I might have to go to start over again
I might go back down to Texas
I might go somewhere that I never been
And get up in the morning and go out at night
And I won't have to go home
Get used to being alone
Change the words to this song
And start singing again
Looking for answers to questions that I already know
I could build me a castle of memories
Just to have somewhere to go
Count the days and the nights that it takes
To get back in the saddle again
Feed the pigeons some clay
Turn the night into day

Lying there in bed listening To his new born baby cry
He makes a pot of coffee  He splashes water on his face
His wife gives him a kiss and says It gonna be OK
It wont be like this for long
One day we'll look back laugh'n
At the week we brought her home
This phase is gonna fly by
So baby just hold on
It wont be like this for long
Four years later 'bout four thirty
She's crawling in their bed
And when he drops her off at preschool
She's clinging to his leg
The teacher peels her off of him
He says what can I do
She says now dont you worry
This will only last a week or two
It wont be like this for long
One day soon you'll drop her off
And she wont even know your gone
This phase is gonna fly by
If you can just hold on
It wont be like this for long
Some day soon she'll be a teenager
And at times he'll think she hates him 
Then he'll walk her down the isle
And raise her veil
But right now she up and cry'n
And the truth is that he don’t mind
As he kisses her good night
And she says her prayers
He lays down there beside her
'Til her eyes are finally closed
And just watching her it breaks his heart
Cause he already knows
It wont be like this for long
One day soon that little girl is gonna be 
All grown up and gone
Yeah this phase is gonna fly by 
So he's trying to hold on

But money lights your world up, you're trapped what can you do?
You got Tennessee tendencies and chemical dependencies
You make the same old jokes and malaprops on cue

Your filled up with what other people need
Hardship, damnation and guilt
Make you wonder why you were even built

We lived and learned, life threw curves; there was joy and there was hurt:

And life was changed,    disassembled, rearranged.
We came together, fell apart, and broke each other's hearts:

Was the music,     we danced to, week to week.
Brought back the love, we found trust; vowed we'd never give it up:

Now, lookin' back,     it's just a steppin' stone.
To where we are, where we've been; said we'd do it all again:

When the children,     grow up and move away.

Would      fill the earth

How ever many lies i tell without my tongue
Get twisted into memories 'til i believe them some

And you toy with me
Can you stop this please

 Pick up my gun and get back to work
 And it keeps me drivin’ on
 Waitin’ on,      letters from home

 I’ve been lying here all night long, wonderin’ where you might be
 I saw your Momma and I showed her the ring
 Man on the television said some thing, so I couldn’t sleep

 And sittin’ here tonight alone in the kitchen

 So I’ll say it now, son you make me proud

And yeah, I know you really liked her, and it just don't seem fair
All I can say is pain like that is fast, and it's rare.

But I know at 17, it's hard to see past Friday night

And you're wondering if you'll survive
You'll make it through this and you'll see
You're still around to write this letter to me.

Always stop completely
Don't just tap your brakes
And when you get a date with Bridgett
Make sure the tank is full

That one turns out kinda cool

Just assume you're wrong and dad is right
And you should really thank Mrs. Brinkman

It's like she's the diamond underneath
And she's polishing you 'til you shine.
And oh, you got so much going for you, going right
But I know at 17 it's hard to see past Friday night

Because if you fail algebra, mom and dad will kill you dead
Trust me you'll squeak by and get a C
And you're still around to write this letter to me.

You'll make new friends, you should see your kids and wife
And I'd end by saying have no fear
These are nowhere near the best years of your life.

I was silently celebrating my first class upgrade
Laughing at my jeans and my boots
Beside those high dollar shoes and Armani suits
When the gentlemen next to me said the drinks up here are free
So if you like, the first one can be on me
He said I'm heading back from business in New York and Rome
Tell me son, where do you call home?
I said I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church
A courthouse clock that still don't work
Where a man's word means everything
Where moms and dads were high school flames
And gave their children grandmothers maiden names
Yes it may not sound like much
But it's where I'm from
So we drank that round, and then another
There wasn't a topic in this world we did not cover
He said I headed out west when I was barely nineteen
Just a kid chasing my dreams
And I said I'm flying out here to pick up my big brother
He's been fighting the cancer they discovered
But he called last night and said I think this is the end
So come take me home to my family and my friends
Where the quarterback dates the homecoming queen
The truck's a Ford and the tractor's green
And amazing grace is what we sing
Theres a county fair every fall
And your friends are there no matter when you call
It may not sound like much
But it's where I'm from
And as we stood to claim the bags we checked
He said I'll pray for your brother and did I mention that
Italian suits haven't always been my style
See I was the quarterback of my high school team
We took state back in sixty three
And my wife, she's still my homecoming queen
Cuz I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church
A courthouse clock that still don't work
Where a man's word means everything
Where moms and dads were high school flames
And gave their children grandmothers maiden names
Yes it may not sound like much
I said it may not sound like much
But it's where I'm from

We had to leave on the ferry-boat
Economic  refugees
On the run to Germany
We had the back of Maggie’s hand
Times were tough in Geordieland
We got wor tools and working gear
And humped it all from Newcastle to here

Why aye man, why aye, why aye man
Why aye man, why aye, why aye man
Why aye man, why aye, why aye man

We’re nomad tribes, travelling boys
In the dust and the dirt and the wrecking noise
Drills and hammers, diggers and picks
Mixing concrete, laying bricks
There’s English, Irish, Scots, the lot
United Nation’s what we’ve got
Brickies, Chippies, every trade
German building, British-made

Hidaway down the auto-bahn
Mine’s a porta cabin bed
Or a bunk in a Nissan hut instead

And German tarts are wunderschön
German beer is chemical- free

You broke a heart that cried for you
I've wasted all my tears on you
For all I've ever loved was you
Go out and find somebody new
But you'll be sorry if you do
You'll never find a love so true
For all I ever loved was you
Buy her rings and diamonds too
But you'll be sorry if you do
You'll never find a love so true
For all I ever loved was you

And he chases it down with Wild Turkey bourbon liquor

Bus headed north one headed south
I call a farm in Colorado
And I lift a dusty pay phone to my mouth
She says hello I say it's me hon
Sorry I stayed away so long
Tell the kids thier old man's through with playin' rodeo
Cause if it's alright with you I'm comin' home
Well there's silence on the line
She says you sure did take your time
But I still need a man for the things a man is good for
You know how it is raisin' crops and raisin' kids
Demands a man at least as fit as you are
So come on git on home there's hay that needs a mowin'
A boy that needs a whippin' and a hundred things to do
I hope you've finally found your mind
To leave that rodeo behind
I've spent half my life just waitin' here for you
I guess that nows the time I'd better tell her
Hon I've got this old friend that's here with me
He used to be a cowboy and a good one so they say
But now his legs are crippled he can't walk you see
But hon you ought to hear him tell his stories
Sing the old songs play the guitar too
I'd really like to show him Colorado
But I thought I'd better leave it up to you
Well there's silence on the line
And now I hear her sayin'
Babe I only need a man for the things a man is good for
And you know how it is a place just half this big
Demands a man at least as fit as you are
Put yourself in his place it'd awful hard to face
All the chores and work and nothing he could do
If you want to know my mind leave that rodeo bum behind
Don't waste our time I'm waitin' here for you
Well cryin's just for kids I put down the phone
Fumble with my crutches movin' slow
I wish that I was on the bus that's Colorado bound
And I hope the weather's nice in Mexico

and no one even thought of asking me.
The day I turned fifteen I caght the mailtrain
To find what else might be in life for me.
I rode on trucks and trains and lived on nothing;
Served me right for wanting to be free-
Ah well that's the way society looked at it 
But it didn't seem to be that way to me.
And the biggest disappointment in the family was me;
the only twisted branch upon our good old fam'y tree
I just couldn't be the person they ecpected me to be
And the biggest disappiontment in the world was me
A lot more dinner times than there dinners
I learned a lot that hurt me at the time
Then this quiet country boy came home a different man
with a memory of distance on my mind
But i always spoke to loud and drank to often 
Maybe drank to many glasses down
And perhaps my clothes were older that I realized
A relief to all concerned when I left town
And the biggest disappointment in the family was me;
the only twisted branch upon our good old fam'y tree
I just couldn't be the person they ecpected me to be

When this old gray black gentleman was cleanin' up the lounge
Well, there wasn't anyone around 'cept this old man and me

Uninvited, he sat down and opened up his mind
On old dogs and children and watermelon wine
You ever had a drink of watermelon wine? he asked
N' he told me all about it, though I didn't answer back
He said ain't but three things in this world that's worth a solitary dime
But old dogs and children and watermelon wine
He said, women think about theyselves, when menfolk ain't around
And friends are hard to find when they discover that you're down
He said I tried it all when I was young and in my natural prime
Now it's old dogs and children and watermelon wine
They said old dogs care about you, even when you make mistakes
God bless little children while they're still too young to hate

He had his big named lawyer and he had that smirkey smile
Oh yeah he got you off on a technicality
But you'll have to grow wings and fly to ever get away from me
Cause I got rights I got rights too
And this time there won't be no damn lawyer and system to protect you
But I'm gonna read you I'm gonna read you your rights
You gotta right to know that you're gonna go to hell one of these black 
nights
When the trial was over he had the nerve to say that's the way it goes
I said well hoss you better get you some corks

But o the ache thats in them for the place where I was born,
My weary hands are blistered,from working cold and heath,
But o to swing the scythe again,in a field of Irish wheat,
Had I the chance to wander back or own a King's abode,
I'd sooner see the hawthorn tree,by the  old bog road.
My mother died last springtime,when Ireland's field's were green,
The neighbours said her waking was the finest ever seen,
There were snowdrops and primroses,piled high beside her bed,
And Ferns Church was crouded,when the funeral mass was said,
But here was I on Broadway,just building bricks by load,
When they carried out her coffin down the Old Bog Road.
Now life is a weary puzzle,as finding out by man,
I take the day for what it's worth,and do the best I can,
Since no one cares a rush for me what need for me to moan,
I go my way and draw my pay and smoke my pipe alone,
Each human heart must know it's grief,though bitter be the load,
So God be with you Ireland,and the Old Bog Road.

Rode into town one day
And under his knees was a raging black stallion
And walking behind was a bay
The red-headed stranger had eyes like thunder
And lips that were sad and tight
His little lost love lay asleep on the hillside
And his heart was heavy as night
So don't cross him don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and he's hiding his pain
Don't fight him don't spite him
Just wait 'til tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again
And watched as he passed her way
And she drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion
But cast greedy eyes on the bay
But how could she know that the dancing bay pony
Meant more to him than life
For this was the horse that his little lost darling
Had ridden when she was his wife
So don't cross him don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and he's hiding his pain
Don't fight him don't spite him
Just wait 'til tomorrow
Maybe he'll ride on again
And looked up the stranger there
He bought her a drink and he gave her some money
But he just didn't seem to care
She followed him out as he saddled his stallion
And laughed as she grabbed at the bay
He shot her so quick they had no time to warn her
She never heard anyone say
So don't cross him don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and he's hiding his pain
Don't fight him don't spite him
Just wait 'til tomorrow

For you can't hang a man for killing a woman
Who's trying to steal your horse
Now this is the tale of the red-headed stranger
And if he should pass your way
Stay out of the path of the raging black stallion
And don't lay a hand on the bay
So don't cross him don't boss him
He's wild in his sorrow
He's riding and he's hiding his pain
Don't fight him don't spite him

Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometimes
When you take you gotta give, so live and let live or let go-woah-woah-woah
I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
I could promise you things like big diamond rings
But you don't find roses growing on stalks of clover
So you better think it over
Well, if sweet talking you could make it come true
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter
But what would it matter
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can
I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometimes
I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon
But if that's what it takes to hold you, I'd just as soon let you go
But there's one thing I want you to know
You better look before you leap, still waters run deep
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out
And you know what I'm talking about
So smile for a while and let's be jolly
Love shouldn't be so melancholy
Come along and share the good times while we can
I beg your pardon, I never promised you a rose garden
Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometimes
I beg your pardon...

44,The Lord Knows Im Drinking,Cal Smith,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/cal-smith/the-lord-knows-im-drinking-chords-1460310,"Hello Mrs. Johnson you self-righteous woman
Sunday School teacher what brings you out slumming
Do you reckon the preacher would approve where you are
Standing here visiting with a back-sliding Christian
In a neighborhood bar
And I see you're eye balling this pretty young lass
It ain't none of your business but yes she's with me
And we don't need no sermon you self-righteous woman
Just let us be
The Lord knows I'm drinking and running around 
And He don't need your loud mouth informing the town
The Lord knows I'm sinning  and sinning ain't right 
But me and the Good Lord's gonna have us a good talk
Later tonight
I don't need your preaching and I don't need your pity
So go back to whatever you hypocrites do
And when I talk to Heaven be nice and I'll put in 
A good word for you
The Lord knows I'm drinking and running around 
And He don't need your loud mouth informing the town
The Lord knows I'm sinning  and sinning ain't right

46,Griselda,The Holy Modal Rounders,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-holy-modal-rounders/griselda-chords-1978861,"Come won't you walk with me Griselda,
wearing the dress that moonlight shines through.
I am a sad and lonely boy,
since your mother said I couldn't see you.
Slipping through the woods in the dark of the night,
calling to the moon out yonder
O Lady Moon won't you shine a silver light, and lead me to my Griselda.
Do you recall last night Griselda?
Learning the lessons nature taught us.
Watching the fish jump in the lake,
it was lovely till your mother caught us.
Slipping through the woods in the dark of the night,
calling to the moon out yonder
O Lady Moon won't you shine a silver light, and lead me to my Griselda.
Moonflower vine upon your window,
gives me a foothold for my finding.
I've got a row boat on the lake.
Moon is out and all the stars are shining.
Slipping through the woods in the dark of the night,
calling to the moon out yonder
O Lady Moon won't you shine a silver light, and lead me to my Griselda.
I've got a jug of wine Griselda.
Why must you waste your time in sorrow?
Hold out your hand; have no fear.
If we're caught, I'll marry you tomorrow.
Slipping through the woods in the dark of the night,
calling to the moon out yonder
O Lady Moon won't you shine a silver light, and lead me to my Griselda.

Haven't got a thing to call my own
Though I'm out of money I'm a millionaire
I still have my home in San Antone
When I greet my neighbors with a hi ya’ll
I'm wealthy as a king upon a throne
You can have your mansion or your cottage small
I'll just take my home in San Antone
Traveled over the country on my merry way
Been in crowds and felt I was alone
When I feel like bragging I just up and say
I'm a native son of San Antone
There's a sweet somebody by the Alamo
Someday she's gonna be my very own
And we'll buy a highchair in a year or so
For our little Home In San Antone

And I know that he can give you   all the things I never could

Yes, the door is always open   and the lights on in the hall
And you know that I'll be waiting,   if you ever come to call
When night falls on that mansion   and you're lying in his bed
When he begs you for attention,  will you think of me instead
When he reaches out to touch you,  is your face turned to the wall?
Well the door is always open,  and the lights on in the hall

Your kisses were meant for only me

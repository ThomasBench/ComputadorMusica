0,Mary In The Morning,Glen Campbell,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/glen-campbell/mary-in-the-morning-chords-1252137,"   Nothing's quite as pretty  as Mary in the morning
   When through a sleepy haze I see her lyin' there
   Soft as the rain that falls on summer flowers
   Warm as the sunlight shinin' on her golden hair, mhm.
   When I wake and see her there so close beside me
   I want to take   her in my arms
   The ache is there so deep inside me
   And nothing's quite as pretty  as Mary in the morning.
   Chasin' a rainbow in the dream so far away
   And when she turns to touch it  I kiss her face so softly
   My Mary wakes to love another day, mhm.
   My Mary's there in sunny days or stormy weather
   She doesn't care 'cause right or wrong
   The love we share we share together
   And nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the evening.
   Kissed by the shades of night and starlight on her hair
   And as we walk I hold her close beside me
  Oh, how tomorrows for lifetime we'll share, mhm.
   Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the morning
   Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the evening...

Though he's callous and cold
He may learn to give his heart for love
Instead of buying it with gold
Then the poor man's roses
Or the thrill when we kiss
Will be memories of paradise
That I'll never miss
And yet the hand that brings the rose tonight
Is the hand I will hold
For the rose of love means more to me
More than any rich man's gold

It was there an old cow-puncher stepped up and said to me
How do you do young fellow and how would you like to go
And spend a pleasant summer out in New Mexico
I'll furnish you good wages your transportation too
If you will but go with me one summer season's through
But if you should get homesick and back to Griffin go
Then I'll furnish you no horses from the hills of Mexico
We left the town of Griffin in the merry month of May
When all the world was lovely and everything was gay
With saddles on our horses marching onward we did go
Until we reached Old Boggy out in New Mexico
It was there our pleasures ended and our troubles they began
The first hailstorm fell on us, those cattle how they ran
Through all the thorns and thistles the cowboys had to go
While the Indians watched upon us out in New Mexico
And when the drive was over the rider would not pay
To all you happy people this much I have to say
Go back to your friends and loved ones tell others not to go
To the God-forsaken country they call New Mexico

The unborn grass lies waiting for its coat to turn to green
The snowbird sings the song he always sings
And speaks to me of flowers that will bloom again in spring 
When I was young my heart was young then too
And anything that it would tell me that's the thing that I would do
But now I feel such emptiness within
For the thing that I want most in life's the thing that I can't win
Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would fly away with you
The breeze along the river seems to say
That he'll only break my heart again should I decide to stay
So little snowbird take me with you when you go
To that land of gentle breezes where the peaceful waters flow
Spread your tiny wings and fly away
And take the snow back with you where it came from on that day
The one I love forever is untrue
And if I could you know that I would fly away with you
Yeah if I could you know that I would fly away with you

I'd seen at the big rodeo
He'd bite you and kick you and stomp out your life
Old Red had never been rode
Meaner than sin, wild as the wind
That blew on the Montana plains
Old Red was one of the last of his breed
And wasn't about to be tamed
From Idaho, a young cowboy came
To ride in the big rodeo
The young cowboy's name was Billy McLane
And Billy had never been thrown
The greatest desire filled young Billy's heart
To ride this old outlaw called Red
He drew him one day and I heard Billy say
""I'll ride him or drop over dead""
Old Red was wicked down there in the shoot
He was kicking and stomping about
Billy climbed into the saddle with ease
And yelled turn him loose let us out
Old Red came out with his head on the ground
His back hooves were touching his nose
Trying to get rid of the man on his back
But the man went wherever he'd go
Billy was raking Old Red with his spurs
From his tail to the tip of his chin
He was doing right well, but Billy could tell
This outlaw would never give in
Old Red was running straight for the fence
Suddenly stopping and then
He reared on his hind legs then fell on his back
Taking poor Billy with him
There was a hush in the crowd and they knew
This would be Billy's last ride
The saddle horn crushed Billy's chest when they fell
And under Old Red Billy died
Old Red lay still, no more would he move
The cowboys that seen it could tell
In trying to throw Billy off his back
Old Red broke his neck when he fell
Out in the west is a place where they rest
This cowboy that never was thrown
And one foot away resting there 'neath the clay
Is the outlaw that never was rode

At the Indianapolis of your heart I lost the race.

In the theater of your love I lost my part.

And the stars are all a' glow
From the bridge, I see reflections
In the waters far below
You kissed me for the first time here
An' held me awfully tight
And the bridge became our favorite place
We came here often in the night
And one night while standing on the bridge
Desire swept through us both
Passion took us by the hand
And showed us where to go
From the bridge we saw a meadow
So we ran together there
Where we found love together
Our emotions filled the air
The bridge, so high
The bridge, so tall
Here is where it started
On the bridge
Tonight, while standing on the bridge
My heart is beating wild
To think that you could leave me here
With our unborn child
My feet are moving slowly
Closer to the edge
Here is where it started
And here is where I'll end it

I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
I stuck that loving 44 beneath my head
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down
If you've got the warrant just a-read it to me
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more
They put me on a train and they took me back
They slapped my dried up carcass in that country jail
I spied the sheriff coming down the line
He said come on you dirty heck into that district court
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
I saw the little judge commence to look about
Holding the verdict in his right hand
I hollered Lordy Lordy have a mercy on me
99 years in the Folsom pen
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down
Come on you've gotta listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be

Carry my prayers on the sea
And if you are meant to be mine, love
One day you'll come home to me
But are you a trick of the memory
That the old gods are playing on me
Carry my prayers on the ocean
Carry my prayers on the sea
Your blue eyes are there when I close mine
I see your sweet face when I dream
My heart is all ragged in pieces
Bleeding at every seam
And are you a trick of the memory
That the old gods are playing on me
Carry my prayers on the ocean
Carry my prayers on the sea
I'm down on my knees at a crossing
Wondering which way to go
But all roads are dark through the valley
And I'll learn to walk them alone
And are you a trick of the memory
That the old gods are playing on me
Carry my prayers on the ocean
Carry my prayers on the sea
No wine and no song can soothe me
I'm pierced by the arrows of pain
I'll lay in the grass by the mountain
And summon the wind and the rain
And are you a trick of the memory
That the old gods are playing on me
Carry my prayers on the ocean
Carry my prayers on the sea
Carry my prayers on the ocean
Carry my prayers on the sea

Well the world is on it's head and I thank my lucky stars that I ain't dead
I've spent my whole life in the red, and I've done my best to keep my family fed
When I lay my burdens down, keep my debts out of your mind just for a while
All my troubles and my trials lay scattered on the trail for miles and miles
I've been paying my whole life, trying hard to find the blame for all my strife
I've been burning through my checks and I've never felt that gold around my neck
Aw but that gold it don't shine as bright as worn out steel rail on the line
If you go ride it you might find that the faces on you change with change in time
I was a victim of a charge, made and spent life playing honky tonks and bars
But good times don't pay the bills, and a belly by itself does not fill
So I've been saving up my pay, waiting on a new uncloudy day
Watch all the hard times drift away and I'll no longer be chained to their dismay
Well the world is on it's head and I thank my lucky stars that I ain't dead
I've spent my whole life in the red, and I've done my best to keep my family fed

So I keep the wheels down 'til I hit the next town just to hide in the pleasures I find

But in the smoky old motels and burned out saloons my poor heart it bellows and rings
Well I long for those things that my life will not bring, I'm reeling straight out of my mind

  There is a tribe and it ain't too hard to find
Where the rich man came and‚Åüflooded‚Åüall‚Åüthe land
They had‚Åüno mercy on‚Åüthe people old and young
They were blinded by the silver on their tongues
All the land that they take, just to build themselves a lake

Well 180,000 acres of ancestral land
That Sabine been river bottom, flooded by the dam

But it just don't mean a thing to the faces in your hand
Well back in 1963 the land of the proud, the brace and the free
But it ain't that way for everyone you see
  They washed out the land so be careful where you stand
Like a boulder fallin' on a grain of sand
Well I hope that dirty reservoir was worth all the lives you scarred
And the people you left hangin' out to dry
Well lord knows that tried their best to turn the tide
But there ain't no sense in waitin' 'round to die

And she raised her children the best way she knew how
   They lived off the earth back before the times of dearth
They counted on the seed and the plow
But the crops they all drowned in the water rushin' down
Only 25 bucks an acre they were paid

Did you know that your baby boy has walked where angels trod
And when you've kissed your little baby
You've had kissed the face of God
Oh Mary, did you know
The blind will see, the deaf will hear
The dead will live again
The lame will leap, the dumb will speak
The praises of the Lamb
  Mary  if you knew how wonderful for you
  That he'd choose you to bring to us
  The king of kings, hm, God bless you Mary
Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Is Lord of all creation
Mary did you know that your baby boy
Will one day rule the nations
Did you know that your baby boy is heaven's perfect Lamb
This sleeping child you're holding is the great ""I Am""
Mary, did you know, did you know, He's the Lord of all creation
 Did you know, did you know, He's the ruler of all nations
 He walks where angels trod, He is the son of God, Oh Mary, did you know, did you know

Where the mountains are high near Harlan,
where the whirlpools twirl on down
where my secret can be found
In the dark and bloody ground...
Oh how I missed you
Oh how I've cried
I'd like to lay down by my side
Love you just once before I die
And I'd be gentle, and I'd never hurt you
And God might send a moonbeam
Lay us down in pleasant dreams
Whatsoever things are lovely
Whatsoever things are true
Whatsoever things are kind and pure thank you, these things...
And God might send down a moonbeam
And lay us down in pleasant dreams.
Dewy was my best friend, he was tall
Stood six foot nine against the wall
We both loved the same girl, but Dewy he went bad
And I guess you could say it made one mad
He didn't have to do those awful things to you
Yeah Dewy really made me sick
But I guess it takes two heels to click
I took my nine pound hammer, swung it hard and swung it round
I kicked him in the temple, watched him fall to the ground wooaaahhhh
My blade found its mark in the dark, and that blood flowed in the sand
From that tall Kentucky man
Oh hell hath no fury like the blues
When a man's got on his killing shoes

One foot off the ground, the deer in the dawn
Has vanished, just like the trail
Staring up into the darkness
Confusing the snowfall for stars
Alone, with no prayers or reason
Accepting the fact that this will all pass
And cruel to the bone, nobody's at home
Out here in nature's domain
Was it all for naught, all the lessons we taught?
So callous and bent on deceiving
The owl in the barn, spinning your yarn

He said, ""I'm sorry for your troubles, she must go back home with thee""
Said, ""Get your mule,"" and waved his palm
Said, ""You both now may go in peace""
So Dood climbed back up on ol' Shamrock
He and Juanita went home happily
When he woke up, he saw the faces of the mighty Cherokee
They'd found Shamrock and him passed out together
Underneath the forest canopy
Saw his tomahawk and skins, and they knew he was Shawnee
So to see the Chief he now must go, one and all they did agree
The old man stared into his soul, though he was blind as he could be
Said, ""If you're looking for your woman, it is here you shall find she""
Said, ""A man McClure had traded her for horses, on which he used so he could flee""
Dood said, ""She wasn't his to trade, h–µ stole her away and he shot m–µ""
Then the old man whispered softly, ""Her you now must go and see""

Dood figured that he was about three hundred yards away
Seamus didn't know that he was deadly as can be
Thought he was out of range of that rifle from Kentucky
Dood laid that old long rifle right across a fallen tree
Took moonlight sight on Seamus, let that iron ball fly free
His shot was true as David's rock, and it found its mark for sure
Knocked him flying from his horse, the one they call McClure
Left the varnish off his words, feared no beast nor man
And if either came upon him they'd damn sure get slayed
He was harder than the nails hammered Jesus' hands
He was the one they called Dood
Son of a mountain miner and a Shawnee maiden
Ol' Dood walked down the holler to go inspect his man
He found Seamus playing possum, knife ready in his hand
But Ol' Dood saw it coming, beat him to the draw
Moonlight bouncing off that tomahawk is the last thing
Ol' Seamus ever saw
He left the varnish off his words, feared no beast nor man
Didn't want to end up in his debt 'cause it'd damn sure get paid
He was harder than the nails hammered Jesus' hands
He was the one they called Dood

He was raised by our mother the light of her eye
And last I had heard he'd run south of the border
The day Mama died he lost his way
So I'm just passing through in search of my brother

Oh Brother I'm trying to find you
I'm riding south to old Mexico
Oh Brother I'm trying to find you

I was blown from the rig when we first hit the big one
Black gold covered my head to my shoes
And with blood on his bootstraps and mud on his knuckles
He reached for my hand but he called out for you
You see Daddy'd grown weary late last December
He kept forgettin' my name and he chose not to shave
A life with a drill and a son and a shovel
He dug his whole life 'til he dug his own grave
Oh Brother I'm trying to find you
I'm riding south to old Mexico
Oh Brother I'm trying to find you
We just struck oil and Daddy's passed on
You know he never spoke one word about Mother

The love that he had for my younger brother
Spilled from his lips like the bubbling crude

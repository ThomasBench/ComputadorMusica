It's one of those never forget it, better stop and take it in kinda scenes.
Everything's just right, yeah except for one thing.
You should be here, standin' with your arm around me here.
Cuttin' up, crackin' a cold beer, sayin' cheers, hey, y'all it's sure been a good year. 
It's one of those moments, that's got your name written all over it.
And you know that if I had just one wish it'd be that you didn't have to miss this.
You'd be takin' way too many pictures on your phone.
Showin' them off to everybody that you know back home.
They say now you're in a better place.
You should be here, standin' with your arm around me here.

1,Cover Me Up,Jason Isbell,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jason-isbell/cover-me-up-chords-1398440,"A heart on the run, keeps a hand on a gun, it cant trust anyone
I was so sure, what I needed was more, tried to shoot out the sun
In days when we raged, we flew off the page, such damage was done
But I made it through, cause somebody knew, I was meant for someone
So girl leave your boots by the bed we aint leavin this room
Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
Its cold in this house and I aint  going out to chop wood
So cover me up and know youre enough to use me for good
Put your faith to the test, when I tore off your dress, in Richmond all high
I sobered up, and I swore off that stuff, forever this time 
In the old lovers scene, I thought itd be me, who helped him get home
But home was a dream, one that Id never seen, till you came along
So girl hang your dress up to dry we aint leavin this room
Til Percy Priest breaks open wide and the river runs through
Carries this house on the stones like a piece of drift wood
Cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

Didn't see how dirt could do such harm
Seasons came and the seasons left
The only thing that changed was the shape of her dress
She said: you're a good man, you'll have my child
You can't raise a living a thing on this cursëd old ground
We laid a sheet on the piano keys
Crying good lord, please, please
Packed our things into the old farm car
Wondering if it could take us very far
Everything about it takes a little luck

It doesn't come with any guarantees
But there's gas in the tank, Louise

Like a couple of jackrabbits dancing in the morning snow
Knew we'd make it, if we could just get out

She took my arm - said, ""It's time now""

You take me out dancin' on the weekends that you don't sing
Cause in a life where we work out, you still call me babe
Life is only ups and downs
Maybe you'll come on back around
Save me from what I've become
Lord knows I can't keep losing sleep dreaming about a life where we work out
Our love's still hotter than a Texas summer day
You still bite your lip when I look at you in that way
We pull off on some old dirt road on the way home cause we can't wait
Cause in a life where we work out, our love's hotter than a summer day
Life is only ups and downs
Maybe you'll come on back around
Save me from what I've become

14,Birds With Broken Wings,Ben Caplan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ben-caplan/birds-with-broken-wings-chords-1669290,"Bring me birds with broken wings, Men with all the answers,
People who have killed,Give me incurable cancers.
Bring me beaches slicked in oil, Give me disregard for doubt,
Street lights shine on broken Roads where no one is about.
I want that hopeless green depression, Punishments without a cause,
Give me impotent obsession, And disregard for laws.
I want the trees in single file, Bring the corpse of something rare,
Show me children who are sinners, Show me mounds of human hair.
I climbed up the mountain just to kill my son,
An angel tried to stop me with a ram,
Well he said “your mind’s infected”, But I said “you lack perspective”,
You gotta walk the bottom if you wanna see the top,
La da da da, La da da da, La da da da da da da da da da  
La da da da, La da da da, La da da da da da da da da da  
Give me poison I can swim in, Water I can’t drink,
Wheels that won’t stop spinning, Teach my children not to think.
I want the fruit that tastes like nothing, extra thumbs for every crook,
Give me lessons without questions, a mild disdain for books.
Give me metaphors unraveled, Poetry defined,
Bring me the head of Dionysius, But please don’t spill out the wine.
Trade the future for the present, Trade me ashes for my history,
I don’t need to look inside,I know the answer to the mystery.
I climbed up the mountain just to kill my son,
An angel tried to stop me with a ram,
Well he said “your mind’s infected”, But I said “you lack perspective”,

But there will be no turning back,
I don’t care if things get ugly.
Once the word of god is spoken,
There’s no way to take it back,

In Saskatoon
She was beaming bold and beautiful
And higher than the moon
Before I could profess
She left too soon
The words she spoke
Were enough to make me blue
She said I know
Just what you're wishing
Two folks in our condition
We'd never leave this 
Bar room with our pride
So go about your earthly mission
Don't trust no politician
You look to yours
And I will look to mine
I met a Nashville
Honky-tonkin' queen
And the caress of her amber lips
Is reserved for Jim Beam
I took her by the arm
And she made a scene
Whiskey was yet to dull
Her tongue it seemed
She said I know
Just what you're wishing
Two folks in our condition
We'd never leave this 
Bar room with our pride
So go about your earthly mission
Don't trust no politician
You look to yours
And I will look to mine
Now West By-God Virginia
Is where I'm bound
She's as wild and she's as wonderful
As any girl I've found
She'll keep me just as long
As I'm around
I never have to hear
That awful sound
She said I know
Just what you're wishing

Well I've finally found a friend
I've found a friend
Codeine, Codeine
You're the nicest thing I've seen
For a while
For a while
Well you hold my hand as I step into the room
And all these people they'll all be fading soon
It's whisper time remembered 
through armor thorns and knives
And it's all I got left 
to hold on to
Codeine, Codeine
You're the nicest thing I've seen
For a while
For a while
Well you can keep your dusty bottles on your s shelf
And you can keep your words of wisdom to yourself
I love you darling so
Why can't you let me go
Before you find me hanging 
in my cell
Codeine, Codeine
You're the nicest thing I've seen
For a while
For a while
Codeine, Codeine
You're the nicest thing I've seen
For a while

This man's had all he can stand, time to lay this body down
Sweet Annie, can I stay with you a while
Cause this roads been putting miles on my heart
Sweetheart I've been livin in a fantasy but one day lightning will strike
And my bark will lose its bite but dont give up on me sweet Annie
Sweet Annie, I know I promised you a life
But with an empty bed and the words I said dont carry any weight
If I could take back yesterday, find a way to start it over
Turn around, put that bottle down and pray its not too late
Sweet Annie, can I stay with you a while
Cause this roads been putting miles on my heart
Sweetheart I've been livin in a fantasy but one day lightning will strike
And my bark will lose its bite but dont give up on me sweet Annie

Fall all over you all over again
Come a little closer so I can show you
My heart still beats fast for you
All over and over again

But how I weep for those who've gone
In rooms of grief and questioned wrong
But keep on killing
It's in the soul to feel such things
But weak to watch without speaking
Oh, what mercy sadness brings
If God be willing
There is a train that's heading straight
To Heaven's gate, to Heaven's gate
And on the way child and man
And woman wait, watch and wait
For redemption day
Fire rages in the streets
And swallows everything it meets
It's just an image often seen
On television
Come leaders, come ye men of great
Let us hear you pontificate
Your many virtues laid to waste
And we aren't listening
There is a train that's heading straight
To Heaven's gate, to Heaven's gate
And on the way child and man
And woman wait, watch and wait
For redemption day
What do you have for us today
Throw us a bone but save the plate
Oh why we waited till so late
Was there no oil to excavate
No riches in trade for the fate
Of every person who died in hate
Throw us a bone, you men of great
There is a train that's heading straight
To Heaven's gate, to Heaven's gate

Exploding in the shells of night
It's everywhere a baby cries

We used to be the ones that they wished they were

Of how bright we burned

String of white lights making your eyes shine tonight

Wrecking ball dancing down the hallway
You're holding your shoes, wearing my shades
We fall against the door, we fall into a wild warm kiss

Got no job, mom pays my bills
Textin', Ex's, get my feels
Sweatin' bullets, Netflix-chills
World's out there singin' the blues
Twenty more dead on the evening news
Think to myself: ""really, what's the use?""
I'm just like you, I was born to lose
Why oh why can't you just fix me?
When all I want's to feel numb
But the medication's all gone
Why oh why does God hate me?
When all I want's to get high
And forget this so-called life
I am so frickin' bored
Nothing to do today
I guess I'll sit around and medicate (I medicate)
I am so frickin' bored
Nothing to do today
I guess I'll sit around and medicate (I medicate)

Chase it down with a hopeful smile
Hate myself, if I can go for miles
They say family is all you need
Someone to trust can help you breathe
Inhale that drug, but you start to choke
You follow the outs of an inside joke
Why oh why can't you just fix me?

She said she was a roll tide fan, I said I bleed orange and blue
She said she had a man back home that she'd been leavin' for some time
He lived just across the Georgia line
Well, she's all Alabama, but she's got her feet stuck in the Georgia clay
Told me she's from Montgomery, but I've seen those Georgia plates
And every time she gets alone with me, I see Georgia on her mind

Well, I got a little bit of huntin' land just outside of Phenix City
And even though it's right down the road, she couldn't find the time to see me
Well pretty soon it's just a text she'd send with a line from her favorite song
But I was writin' one of my own
Well, she's all Alabama, but she's got her feet stuck in the Georgia clay
And she's got a couple bulldog jerseys, but she's never seen them play
And every time she gets a- lone with me, I see Georgia on her mind

Sitting on my tailgate
I can’t help but stare
Summer sun a shining
On her tan skin
I can feel her love
Blowing like the wind
Yes I can
We head out to the lake
Feet hanging off the dock
And talking everything
Sharing every little thought
We take a dip in the water
As the sun set on down
Ain’t nothing like her wet hair
And the crickets sound
It’s a glass of wine to keep her sane
And I love the sound of her full name
Natural southern beauty
Can’t explain what it does to me
She’s everything in my whole world
That’s my forever girl
We ride around in my truck
Singing our songs
She’s looking so damn good
With that sun dress on
She slides on over
I hold her tight
And I say darling
Thank God that you’re mine

48,Like My Mother Does (ver 3),Lauren Alaina,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lauren-alaina/like-my-mother-does-chords-1075950,"People always say I have a laugh 
Like my mother does 
Guess that makes sense 
She taught me how to smile when things get rough 
I've got her spirit 
And she's always got my back 
When I look at her 
I think I wanna be just like that 
When I love, I give it all I got 
Like my mother does 
When I'm scared, I bow my head and pray 
Like my mother does 
When I feel weak and un-pretty 
I know I'm beautiful and strong 
Because, I see myself 
Like my mother does 
I never met a stranger, 
I can talk to anyone 
Like my mother does 
I let my temper fly 
But she can walk away, when she's had enough 
She sees everybody, for who they really are 
I'm so thankful for her guidance 
She's helped me get this far 
When I love, I give it all I got 
Like my mother does 
And when I'm scared, I bow my head and pray 
Like my mother does 
When I feel weak and un-pretty 
I know I'm beautiful and strong 
Because, I see myself 
Like my mother does 
She's a rock 
She is grace 
She's an angel 
She's my heart and soul 
She does it all... 
When I love, I give it all I got 
Like my mother does 
And when I'm scared, I bow my head and pray 
Like my mother does 
When I feel weak and un-pretty 
I know I'm beautiful and strong 
Because, I see myself 
Like my mother does 
Like my mother does

49,Every Scar Has A Story,Cody Johnson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/cody-johnson/every-scar-has-a-story-chords-1870860,"I rode a horse named Whiskey, I thought I could trust
'Til she pinned her ears back and just like a whip crack she left me in the dust
I was cruisin' on my Harley, enjoyin' the breeze
I got hit head on and thrown, lord knows it should've killed me
Every scar has a story, and it leaves its mark
Guess you could say I'm the king of takin' things way too far
I thought I knew pain, ain't nothin' I ain't been through
But when I met you, girl, I fell hard
Every scar has a story, just ask my heart
I remember that mornin', I saw your face
Turnin' down a side street, somethin' inside me said don't let her get away
And those nights that followed, they still haunt me
Cause they were some of the best, I'll never forget how good it used to be
Every scar has a story, and it leaves its mark
Guess you could say I'm the king of takin' things way too far
I thought I knew pain, ain't nothin' I ain't been through
But when I met you, girl, I fell hard
Every scar has a story, just ask my heart
They say old wounds heal with time and they get better
But the hurts you left on me will last forever
Every scar has a story, and it leaves its mark
Guess you could say I'm the king of takin' things way too far
I thought I knew pain ain't nothin' I ain't been through
But when I met you, girl, I fell hard
Every scar has a story, just ask my heart
Just ask my heart

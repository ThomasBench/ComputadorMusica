0,One Day You Will (ver 2),Lady A (Lady Antebellum),https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lady-a-lady-antebellum/one-day-you-will-chords-840007,"You feel like you're falling backwards
Like you're slippin' through the cracks
Like no one would even notice
If you left this town and never came back
You walk outside and all you see is rain
You look inside and all you feel is pain
And you can't see it now
But down the road the sun is shining
In every cloud there's a silver lining
Just keep holding on (just keep holding on)
And every heartache makes you stronger
But it won't be much longer
You'll find love, you'll find peace
And the you you're meant to be
I know right now that's not the way you feel
But one day you will
You wake up every morning and ask yourself
What am I doing here anyway
With the weight of all those disappointments
Whispering in your ear
You're just barely hanging by a thread
You wanna scream but your down to your last breath
And you don't know it yet
But down the road the sun is shining
In every cloud there's a silver lining
Just keep holding on (just keep holding on)
And every heartache makes you stronger
But it won't be much longer
You'll find love, you'll find peace
And the you you're meant to be
I know right now that's not the way you feel
But one day you will
Find the strength to rise above
You will
Find just what you're made of, you're made of
Down the road the sun is shining
In every cloud there's a silver lining
Just keep holding on (just keep holding on)
And every heartache makes you stronger
But it won't be much longer
You'll find love, you'll find peace
And the you you're meant to be
I know right now that's not the way you feel
I know right now that's not the way you feel
But one day you will
One day you will (Oh one day you will)

And she shatters like broken glass
Better play it cool...better let it pass
Have you been screening your smokes?
And whispers in an all night bar
Better off as the fool
Than the owner of that kind of heart
They don't know you anyway
They don't know you and they don't watch you walk away
Just a nobody girl
With a radar to the scene
When the emptiness finds you
You find all the numbers you need
Say you follow your heart
Well, honey you're just being lost
You can follow your gut
But how much would it cost?
They don't know you anyway
They don't know you and they don't watch you walk away

Tears that I’d rather keep, deep down inside,
Tears from a love that’s gone, beyond recall
And when I dim the lights in my room tonight,

I’m gonna pray tonight baby, hoping you will hear,
And maybe you’ll right all those wrongs, and dry each tear,

Lucy in the shade of the dogwood blooms
Yesterday the solace of a poison fish
Tomorrow I'll be kissing on her blood red lips

The lovesong of the buzzard in the dogwood tree
With a train of horses laughing through the traffic line
And the cradle's unimaginative sense of time
A (riff 2) B (riff 2)
Springtime and the promise of an open fist
A tattoo of a flower on a broken wrist
Lucy tells me jokingly to wipe her brow
With a pocket map to heaven and the sun goes down

There was glory in the air there was dinner on the ground
And my sins which were many were washed away and gone
Along with a buffalo nickel I forgot to leave at home
That seemed like such a small small price to pay
For the blessed peace of mind that came to me that day

What you got if you aint got love
The kind that you just wanna give away
It's okay to open up
Go ahead and let the light shine through
  I know it's hard on a rainy day
You wanna shut the world out
And just be left alone
 Don't run out on your faith
Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing    
Is just a grain of sand
What you've been out there searching for Forever
Is in your hands 
When you figure out love is all that matters, after all
Seem so small
   It's so easy to get lost inside
A problem that seems so big, at the time
It's like a river that's so wide
It swallows you whole
While you're sittin' round thinking about what you can't change
And worryin' about all the wrong things
Time's flying by, moving so fast
You better make it count, cause you can't get it back
Sometimes that mountain you've been climbing    
Is just a grain of sand
What you've been out there searching for Forever
Is in your hands 
When you figure out love is all that matters, after all
Seem so small
Seem so small         Yeah---

What you've been out there searching for Forever

Are closin' in on me
My final meal is over
They're gonna set me free
I can feel the fire's a burnin'
As the devil guards my door
I hit my knees in search of Jesus
On a cold jailhouse floor
Lord, now I'm singin'
Get me out of here
I see the preacher's eyes
As my daughter cries
When they strap me in this chair
Lord, I hope she forgives me
For livin' my life this way
Tonight I ride the lightning
To my final judgment day
A hungry blue eyed baby cryin'
Made me rob that store
An' as that boy lay there dyin'
I dropped my pistol on the floor
Yeah, I'd take it all back but there's nothin' I can do
They've covered my face
An' the order's gone through 
As the boss yells Roll on, two
Yeah, tonight I ride the lightning
To my final restin' place

 Leaving no   traces they got no tales to tell

 Casting no   shadow while balancing a-bove

 Every-one's got their own monkey on a wire
Oh-oh down below leader of the choir is
 Waiting for the next monkey on a
Wire
  They keep  no fear  no second prize
 Walking like Jesus with voodoo in their eyes
  They come  in green  they leave in black
 Holding dead roses with bullets in their back

 Every-one's got their own monkey on a wire
Oh-oh down below racked up in the fire
 Waiting for the next monkey on a
Wire

Wondering what to do

You keep on looking into that mirror

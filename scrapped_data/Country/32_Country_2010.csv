0,Daddy Doesnt Pray Anymore (ver 2),Chris Stapleton,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/chris-stapleton/daddy-doesnt-pray-anymore-chords-1837944,"Tab - any time you sing ""daddy doesn't pray anymore, play this:
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
I remember even when the times where bad
He'd thank Jesus for everything he had
A good wife and 3 children , the food up-on our plates
Yeah everything was right when he said grace
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
Guess he's finished talkin' to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
There was a time when we didn't get along
'Cause I thought I was right and he was wrong
Still when I'd lay down at night,  I'd hear him get down on his knees
And say a little prayer for me
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
Guess he's finished talkin' to the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
Today I followed daddy down to church
Listened to the preacher reads Gods words
And we sang his favorite hymn  but daddy didn't make a sound
And this afternoon we'll lay him in the ground
Daddy doesn't pray anymore
Guess he's finally walkin' with the Lord
He used to fold his hands and bow his head down to the floor
Daddy doesn't pray anymore

My boots just couldn't walk another mile
And that cloud above me had no silver lining
I couldn't buy a break with my last dime
Oh but when I saw you standing in the corner
I'd never thought that you would have my back
But then we rolled in like the thunder and the lightning
Threw some punches then we had a laugh
Just some roughed up desperados. Hanging tough through thick and thin
Kicking up dust wherever we go. I can see that you and me are gonna be friends
Who'd thought we'd wind up here together?
It's crazy that we're standing side by side
Fighting just like two birds of a feather
Who's gonna tell us now that we can't fly?
Just some roughed up desperados. Hanging tough through thick and thin
Kicking up dust wherever we go. And I can see that you and me are gonna be friends
To the end you and me are gonna be friends. Yeah, here we go
Hey, hey you and me. Different as different can be
Woah, woah-oh, woah-oh          CHORUS

And rub it in so deep, salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
          It's so sad to me.  Think about the good times, you and I

So take a look what you've done, 'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Now we got problems, I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut, and, baby, now we got bad blood
Did you think we'd be fine? Got scars on my back from your knife
Don't think it's in the past, these kinda wounds they always last.
Did you think it all through? All these things will catch up to you
Time can heal but this won't, so if you're coming my way, just don't

You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that blood runs cold

Every memory still bows to him?

Just forgot on the shelf 
No wind in the sails
Going no where with no one but me
I was one in one-hundred billion
A burned out star in a galaxy
Just lost in the sky wondering why
everyone else shines out but me
I came alive when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you 
You make me better than I was  before

I was a worn out set of shoes
Wondering the city street
Another face in the crowd
Head looking down 
Lost in the sound of a lonely melody
Empty pockets at a roulette
Always landing on a lost bet 
Just live for the spin and hope for the win
Go all in just to lose again

10,Ours (ver 4),Taylor Swift,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/taylor-swift/ours-chords-1159921,"Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now 
 my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, 
 my choice is you
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care 
 'cause right now you're mine
And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours
 And it's not theirs to speculate
If it's wrong and
 Your hands are tough
But they are where mine belong and
 I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you
 'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
 And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
 'Cause my heart is yours
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours

When childhood stars shine, always stay humble and kind
Go to church 'cause your momma says to
Visit grandpa every chance that you can
It wont be wasted time, always stay humble and kind
Hold the door, say ""please"", say ""thank you""
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie

But always stay humble and kind

When the work you put in is realized
Let yourself feel the pride
But always stay humble and kind
Don't expect a free ride from no one
Don't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why:
Bitterness keeps you from flyin'
Always stay humble and kind
Know the difference between sleeping with someone
And sleeping with someone you love

I hope those bricks and boards can take it.
But I won't be surprised if the whole damn place just falls.
I'm gonna rock you baby, like a wrecking ball.
And that old house is gonna be shaking.
Rafter and rocking foundation quaking.
Crash right through the front door, back you up a-gainst the wall.
Love you baby take it right there baby 
rock you baby, like a wrecking ball.

On the beach where the big boats rolled in

Grab your kids, hit the road with a country band
There's room for all y'all inside of my van
Start our lives all over again
Heard you gained a few, got saggy tits
But, who am I to say 'cause I've aged like shit
That's why I think we'd be the perfect fit

Bring your flabby ass back, that'll be enough

 Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'm gonna stay through it all
So jump then    fa-all oh-ahh-ohh
Well I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me, I love each freckle on your face
Oh I've never been so wrapped up
Honey, I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
 I had time to think it oh-over
 And all I can say is come closer
 Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me
'Cause every time you smile I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you
 Whoa oh, I'm feeling you baby
 Don't be afraid to jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
 Baby I'm never gonna leave you
 Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'm gonna stay through it all
So jump then fa-all oh-ahh-ohh
The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
 I'll catch you, I'll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile
 Whoa oh I need you baby
 Don't be afraid, please jump then fall
 Jump then fall into me
 Baby I'm never gonna leave you
 Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'm gonna stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall baby
Jump then fall into me, into me
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine
And every time you're here baby
I'll show you, I'll show you
You can jump then fall, jump then fall
Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah

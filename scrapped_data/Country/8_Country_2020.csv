0,Wonderin Bout The Wind (ver 3),Morgan Wallen,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/morgan-wallen/wonderin-bout-the-wind-chords-4033921,"I don't know where the hell it comes from
Got no idea where it goes when it leaves
And when it's here, it's here, and when it's gone, it's gone
Kinda Like them smoky mountain fall time trees
I guess I'll leave it to somethin' bigger to figure it all out
But I sure could use a little breeze right now
Yeah, if anybody out there somewhere,
Got a secret they want to share,
On why it does to her what it does to dust,
Really just ain’t fair,
Why it always takes her with it,
And only brings her back now and then,
I guess I’ve always been,
Wonderin’ bout the wind.
She sits there like a feather just waitin’ on a gale,
By the time I pushed off she already caught sail,
I’m always waiting to put my anchor down,
But I sure could use a little breeze right now
Yeah, if anybody out there somewhere,
Got a secret they want to share,
On why it does to her what it does to dust,
Really just ain’t fair,
Why it always takes her with it,
And only brings her back now and then,
I guess I’ve always been,
Wonderin’ bout the wind.
Hey I can taste the rain, I can see the sun,
And that makes sense to me,
But this feels like one I that I can’t outrun,
Guess I’m runnin’ just to see.
Yeah, if anybody out there somewhere,
Got a secret they want to share,
On why it does to her what it does to dust,
Really just ain’t fair,
Why it always takes her with it,
And only brings her back now and then,
I guess I’ve always been,
Wonderin’ bout the wind.
And why it always takes her with it
And leaves me hangin' on a limb
Just wonderin' 'bout the wind
Oh, wonderin' 'bout the wind

But it ain't doin' the trick, no
Yeah, it ain't gettin' me gone enough
To make my mind forget
That one shot, two shot, three shot more
Don't change the fact she ain't in the picture anymore
This bar stool ain't workin'
But if anything can
I need a lake, a little bit of bait
I'd even take a creek
I'm tired of all these concrete streets
We were running down
Yeah, what I need right now
Is some roddin' and some reelin', first catch feelin'
Praying to the man for some muddy water healin'
 Don't need no sad song on my radio
Burnin' up some black smoke, down a backroad
I need a boat
I need a boat
Don't care if it's a pontoon
Brand new, been used
As long as it'll fish
Just wanna cast it out yonder
Let my mind wander off to anything but this
I'm tired of runnin' into all my friends
Askin' if I'm over her lovin'
Yeah, but out there where the river lets in
Them fish don't ask me nothin'
I need a lake, a little bit of bait
I'd even take a creek

But you look like you got hillbilly in your bones

Disappear somewhere with a lower population

I got a redneck, yes I do
I got a redneck, how 'bout you?
Just to keep them ole mountains blue
I got a tank full of paycheck money
I'm good friends with Mason Dixon
Girl, whatcha say we do somethin' country?
I'll close thе tab quick
Yeah, I'll take you to the holler

While traveling through this world of woe
There is no sickness, toil, or danger
In that bright world to which I go
I'm going there to see my father
I'm going there no more to roam
I'm just a going over Jordan
I'm just a going over home
I know dark clouds, will gather o'er me
I know my path is rough and steep
But golden fields lie out before me
Where weary eyes, no more shall weep
I'm going there to see my savior
Who shed for me his precious blood

Swore you love Jesse until you is dead

Split an all-star special on our first date.
In a Waffle House booth.
Your daddy was cryin' when he gave you away.
'Cause all those country songs I played.
They didn't come with a 401k.
But hey, I had you.
You can make a six pack on the carpet.
Taste like a million dollar bill.
You can make a one bed room apartment.
Feel like a house up on the hill.
You can make my truck out in the driveway.
Roll like a cleaned up Cadillac.
Girl lookin' at you looking at me that way.
Can make a man feel rich on minimum wage.
Girl your love is money, your love is money.
Yeah your love can make a man feel rich on minimum wage.
Girl your love is money, your love is money.
Yeah your love can make a man feel rich on minimum wage.
You can give me a tab that's always open.
Or Give me a yacht parked out in the ocean.
But all that keepin' up with the Joneses.
It just ain't my style.
Just give me some lights strung out in the yard.
And give me a lawn chair under the stars.
The top of the world's right where you are.
'Cause every time you smile.
You can make a six pack on the carpet.
Taste like a million dollar bill.
You can make a one bed room apartment.

Dirty water gonna cover me over and I'm not gonna make a sound

Troubled days are behind me now and I know they're gonna let me in,
So when you see me walkin' up the FDR drive, just a-singin' and a-clappin' my hands
Tell my mama I love her, tell my Daddy I tried, give my money to my baby to spend.
Lord, I'm goin' uptown to the Harlem River to drown
Dirty water's gonna cover me over and I'm not gonna make a sound
Good times come and they go, even a good man'll break
He'll let his troubles bury him whole even though he knows what's at stake
So I'm taking no chances, carrying over while I'm still good in His grace
I'm no fool, mama, I know the difference between tempting and choosing my fate
Lord, I'm goin' uptown to the Harlem River to drown

When you give in there's a stillness
And a comfort you can find
When you give up there's salvation

Come and take me

You're holding my whole world

I'm the first one to jump on a boat while it's sinking

She's the needle and thread patching me back together

A bold bank robber from Bowlin' Green
He went to the jail house the other day
And last night made his getaway
Well he's long gone from old Kentucky
Long gone, got away lucky
Well he's long gone, know what I mean
Long gone from Bowlin' Green
They sent a posse to bring him back
They put bloodhounds on his track
But the doggone bloodhounds lost their scent
And no one knows where Long John went
Well he's long gone from old Kentucky
Long gone, got away lucky
Well he's long gone, know what I mean
Long gone from Bowlin' Green
I never will forget till the day I die
I found love with a woman held high
She held the ace, I held the deuce
Heads she wins and tails I lose
Well he's long gone from old Kentucky
Long gone, got away lucky
Well he's long gone, know what I mean
Long gone from Bowlin' Green

And on the TV, they say that we're all doomed
There's an ashtray, full of cigarettes
Talking to me,
Are we lonesome yet? //
You caught me staring at the chandelier
No I ain't crying,
The smoke it caused these tears
This place is crowded
Folks they seem upset
I'm just smiling
Are we lonesome yet?
In here there's a price to pay
It costs a lot more to stay
Nobody wants to sharе,
Who told you this town was fair?
Tell me are wе lonesome yet?
I just can't forget
The voice ringing in my head
Are we lonesome yet?
Somebody's talking in the mezzanine
Up the staircase, past the ice machine
I barely hear them judging me in jest
I think I'll ask them
Are we lonesome yet?
This big old city, sure been hard on me
Filled up with people as far as you can see
Electric billboards selling what comes next
They're really saying
Are we lonesome yet?

When they have to change my sheets

Shelter from the world keeping senseless at a distance
I could take your hand and leap across the border
Give a little gas and ride off towards higher ground
Make a piecе of heaven near somе old forgotten town
And let the world pass by 'til there's no turning around
Let the world pass by 'til there's no turning around
I could take your hand and leap across the border
Give a little gas and ride off towards higher ground
Make a piecе of heaven near somе old forgotten town
And let the world pass by 'til there's no turning around
Let the world pass by 'til there's no turning around
Let the world pass by ’til there's no turning around

…Knows exactly where to start
…The weak spot in the armor
Cuts straight to the heart
And the clouds roll over, temperature drops
As it gets closer and it all goes quiet
The voice that I don't wanna hear, the hurtful words I say
The long list of things about myself I wanna change
The heavy cloud that won't leave even after the rain
I try to be a hero 'til it brings me to my knees
Yeah, there's a villain in me
You'll only see me laughing
.. Sunshine and a smiling face
..Sometimes I wear it like a mask
… It's easier that way
And the clouds roll over, temperature drops
As it gets closer and it all goes quiet
The voice that I don't wanna hear, the hurtful words I say
The long list of things about myself I wanna change
The heavy cloud that won't leave even after it rains
I try to be a hero 'til it brings me to my knees
Yeah, there's a villain in me
Maybe one day I'll be
Brave enough to stand my ground, so
Maybe one day he won't
Come around anymore
The voice that I don't wanna hear, the hurtful words I say
The long list of things about myself I wanna change
The heavy cloud that won't leave even after the rain
I try to be a hero 'til it brings me to my knees
Yeah, there's a villain in me
A villain ….. in me

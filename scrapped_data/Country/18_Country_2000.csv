Sittin' out here on the hood of this truck, lookin' up
At a caramel colored sunset sky
Checkin' my watch, doin' the math in my head
Countin' back words to when you said ""good-bye""
Well those runway lights are getting brighter
I'm just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off, and fly
Tryin' to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore
Right now I'm sittin' out here watching airplanes
I would've lied, could've cried, should've tried harder
Done anything to make you stay
I wonder what you'd do if you looked out your window
Saw me runnin' down the runway, just like I was crazy
But that fence is too high, so am i
By now I know you're thirty thousand feet above me
But a million miles away, a million miles away
By now I know I outta' act like you don't love me
But I'm just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off, and fly
I'm just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Take off, and fly
Tryin' to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore
Yeah I'm just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Go bye, bye, bye
I'm just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Baby bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Yeah I'm just sittin' out here watching airplanes
Good-bye, bye, bye, bye

It's brighter than the city lights
  Warmer than a heart of gold
And dingos howl just to break the silence
The sun comes up just to break the cold
  Last night I woke with the stars looking back at me
  Swallowing the sky
  I felt no anger
  I felt no shame
  I felt no reason to cry
  If I'm not here in the morning
  I'll cry a river of tears
  I'll learn to live in a new town
  But my heart is staying here 
When it's quiet out here
  A hundred miles away
You can hear the train on the line
The whistle blows just to break the silence
  I wave just to break the time
  I close my eyes, I think of runnin' water
  I think of runnin' away
But the fire's burned to ashes
And it's darker than before
But I can see as clear as day
  If I'm not here in the morning
  I'll cry a river, river of tears
  I'll learn to live in a new town
  But my heart is staying here
  I'll learn to live in a new town

Can't disguise the living, all the miles that you've been through

The burder that you carry is more than one soul could ever bear

Rough around the edges, won't someone come and take you home?
Waiting for a breakthrough, what will you set your mind to?

When you burnt your hair, knocked over chairs

When you fell asleep with blood on your teeth
I got in my car and drove away
Listen to me butterfly
There's only so much wine
You can drink in one life
And it will never be enough
To save you from the bottom of your glass
Where the state highway starts I parked my car
I got out and stared up at the stars
As meteors dived and shot across the sky
I thought of your sad shining eyes
I came back for my clothes, when the sun finally rose
But you were still passed out on the floor

You can drink in one life

You let everybody down
You're always seventeen in your hometown.
Running from your folks, running from the law
Running from love, running from your fears, running from it all
You keep on running, boy
You'll run yourself in the ground
You're always seventeen in your hometown

She probably won't even remember my name
Just like she didn't back then
Is she married, is she doing fine
Does she known about all the nights I laid awake cryin'
Just to know her hand
The door opens and I run away
Just like the same old clown
You're always seventeen in your hometown
Running from your folks, running from the law
Running from love, running from your fears, running from it all
You keep on running, boy
You'll run yourself in the ground
You're always seventeen in your hometown

No tears will fall, no one's gonna weep
When I hit that road
My boots are broken, my brain is sore
From keeping up with their little world
I've got a heavy load
Gonna leave 'em all just like before
I'm big city bound

Shine like gold buzz like a bee

You steal away the rain and just like that

The pain that he lives in is, almost more than living will allow

As they sink into a poisoned pit, that’s going to take forever to climb out
They carry the weight of the faithful, who follow ‘em down

Every living thing could use a little mercy now
Only the hand of grace can end the race, towards another mushroom cloud
People in power, well, they’ll do anything to keep their crown
I love life, and life itself could use some mercy now
Yea, we all could use a little mercy now

We hang in the balance, dangle ‘tween hell and hallowed ground

I have tried thee it is written in the furnace of affliction

Peppermint bars
Peanut brittle bunk beds and marshmallow walls

And the grounds are grand
And the warden keeps the data on your favorite brands.
Jelly beans and cookie dough
Country restroom on a radio
I got a number on my name
It's hard to rise above the shame
I'm a branded man made in the mold

Like cherry, grape and lemon-lime
Like candy corn and licorice
Like bubble gum and Swedish fish

Drinks beer in champaigne glasses

I'm just going to walk out and wish you all goodnight
I never meant to be a     bad man,
I just had a fast hand
I ended up in Forth Worth 'cause no one knows me here
And time has a funny way of taken away the years
I don't mind the changes or the age that's in my face
Because there is a piece of my soul
In every man I've killed in every God forsaken place
Never meant to be a bad man, I just had a   fast hand
Ain't going to be nothing in hell I haven't lived through here
I'm just going to walk out, yeah tonight I'll save your life
I never meant to be a     bad man,
I just had a fast hand
I didn't want to shoot that man but he heard that I was fast...

And will not lose hope or faith
America, the land of freedom
Is still the home of the brave
So raise the banner called Old Glory
Let us join our fellow man
History will write the story
America  will always stand
Walking thru the fires of danger
There are those who gave their lives
They're the world's greatest heroes
And we won't forget their sacrifice
So raise the banner called Old Glory
Let us join our fellow man
History will write the story
America  will always stand
America is not divided
Our enemies, they will be stopped
'Cause we the people are united
And still one nation under God
History will write the story
America  will always stand

46,If Jesus Comes Tomorrow,Vern Gosdin,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/vern-gosdin/if-jesus-comes-tomorrow-chords-2357689,"If Jesus comes tomorrow to spend some time with you
Would you answer all His questions or lie to hide the truth?
Would you welcome Him with open arms or even let Him in?
If Jesus comes to- morrow, what then?
If Jesus calls your number, could you leave to- day?
Are you ready to lay down your worldly goods and walk a- way?
Would it take a month of Sundays to tell Him of your sin
If Jesus comes to- morrow, what then?
If the sky turns black as midnight in the middle of the day
And somehow you knew that Jesus would soon be on His way
Would you have to beg forgiveness or could you reach out and take His hand
If Jesus comes to- morrow, what then
Would you have to beg forgiveness or could you reach out and take His hand
If Jesus comes to- morrow, what then
If Jesus comes to- morrow, what then

And suddenly
It's hard to breathe
Now and then I get insecure
From all the pain
I'm so ashamed
But I am beautiful
No matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
So don't you bring me down today
To all your friends your delirious
So consumed
In all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The piece is gone
I left the puzzle undone
But you are beautiful
In every single way
Words can't bring you down
You are beautiful
No matter what they say
Words can't bring you down
So don't you bring me down today
We are beautiful
No matter what they say
Words can't bring us down
Don't you bring us down today

Those little white pills we took to forget where we'd been.
And I've seen first-hand what the needle has done to my friend.
Thank God I'm still here to stay away from the places I've been.
You've got to slow down while we can still see the miles.
Put on the brakes in the fast lane and rest for a while.
You live with your demons long enough they seem like your friends.
Put on the brakes in the fast lane before your road ends.
That first cigarette didn’t do much, the second one did.
That first taste of whiskey was good when I was a kid.
So, I’ll tell you first-hand I’ve been there, I know where you are.
In ways I am still that kid with eyes for the stars.
You've got to slow down while we can still see the miles.
Put on the brakes in the fast lane and rest for a while.
You live with your demons long enough they seem like your friends.
Put on the brakes in the fast lane before your road ends.
Put on the brakes in the fast lane before your road ends.

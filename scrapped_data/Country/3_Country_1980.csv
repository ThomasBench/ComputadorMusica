All those things that don't change come what may
But our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
Think I'll go out to Alberta, weather's good there in the fall 
I got some friends that I can go to working for 
Still I wish you'd change your mind, if I asked you one more time 
But we've been through that a hundred times or more 
Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change come what may
But our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
If I get there before the snow flies, and if things are going good 
You could meet me if I sent you down the fare 
But by then it would be winter, nothing much for you to do 
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there 
Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change come what may
But our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way

    And in the sticky heat I feel you open up to me
    Love comes out of nowhere baby
    Just like a hurricane     
    And it feels like rain
    And it feels like rain
   Lying underneath the stars right next to you
   Wondering who you are and how do you do 
   The clouds are rolling across the moon
   - the wind howls out your name
   And it feels like rain 
  And it feels like rain   (Baby can you feel it?)
  We ain't ever gonna make that bridge tonight, babe
  Across Lake Pontchartrain
   And it feels like rain 
  And it feels like rain
  So battin down the hatches baby,
  Leave your heart out on your sleeve
  It looks like we're in for stormy weather
  And that ain't no cause for us to leave
  Just lie here in my arms and let it wash away the pain
   And it feels like rain 
  And it feels like rain
  Baby can you feel it?....
  Gonna let your love wash over me.

Straightnin' the curves
Flatnin' the hills
Someday the mountain might get 'em
But the law never will
Makin' their way
The only way they know how
That's just a little bit more
Than the law will allow.

In a one horse trailer and a mobile home
And she still asks about you all the time
And I guess we never even cross your mind
But oh sometimes I think about you
And the way you used to ride out
In your rhinestones and your sequins
With the sunlight on your hair
And oh the crowd will always love you
But as for me I've come to know
Everything that glitters is not gold
Well old Red he's getting older, and last Saturday he stumbled
But you know I just can't bear to let him go
Little Casey she's still growing and she's started asking questions
And there's certain things a man just doesn't know
Her birthday came and you never even called
I guess we never cross your mind at all
But oh sometimes I think about you
And the way you used to ride out
In your rhinestones and your sequins
With the sunlight on your hair
And oh the crowd will always love you
But as for me I've come to know
Everything that glitters is not gold
Everybody said you'd make it big someday
And I guess that we were only in your way
But someday I'm sure your gonna know the cost
Cause for everything you win there's something lost
But oh sometimes I think about you

There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning

I had dreamed my father had passed away and gone
My world revolved around him, I couldn't lie there anymore
So I made my way down the mirrored hall and tapped upon his door
And I said, ""Daddy, I'm so afraid, how will I go on with you gone that way?
Don't wanna cry anymore so may I stay with you?""
And he said, ""That's my job, that's what I do.  Everything I do is
because of you, to keep you safe with me.  That's my job you see.""
Later we barely got along, this teenage boy and he
Most of the fights it seems were over different dreams we each held for me
He wanted knowledge and learning, I wanted to fly out West
Said, ""I could make it  out there if I just had the fare.
I got half, will you loan me the rest.""
And I said, ""Daddy, I'm so afraid.  There's no guarantee in the plans
I've made.  And if I should fail, who will pay my way back home?""
And he said, ""That's my job, that's what I do.  Everything I do is
because of you, to keep you safe with me.  That's my job you see.""
   Every person carves his spot and fills the hole with light
And I pray someday I might light as bright as he
Woke up  early one bright fall day, to spread the tragic news
After all my travels I settled down within a mile or two
   I make my living with words and rhyme and all this tragedy
Should go into my head and out instead as bits of poetry
But I said, ""Daddy, I'm so afraid, how will I go on with you gone this
How can I come up with a song to say I love you.......?""
""That's my job, that's what I do.  Everything I do is
because of you, to keep you safe with me.  That's my job you see.""
Everything I do is because of you, to keep you safe with me....

Where the word like wildfire spread

Oh, they came like herds of locusts
Every woman, child and man
In their lumbering Conestogas 
They left their track upon the land
Some would fail and some would prosper
Some would die and some would kill
Some would thank the Lord for their deliverance 
Some would curse John Sutter's Mill
Well, they came from New York City
And they came from Alabam'
With their dream of finding fortune 
In this wild unsettled land
Well, some fell prey to hostile arrows
As they tried to cross the land
And some were lost in the Rocky Mountains
With their hands froze to the reins
Some would fail and some would prosper
Some would die and some would kill
Some would beg the Lord for their deliverance 
Some would curse John Sutter's Mill
Some pushed on  to California
Others stopped to take their rest
And by the spring of eighteen-sixty 
They had opened up the west
And then the railroad came behind them
And the land was ploughed and tamed
When old John Sutter went to meet his maker 
With not one penny to his name

Some would die and some would kill
Some would beg the Lord for their deliverance

Met a little girl in the field canteen
Painted her name on the nose of my plane

But they believed the one you vowed to love
Should always stay the same
On the land his daddy gave them a foundation underway
For a love to last forever or until their dying day
They built a bond that was strong enough to stand the test of time
And a place for us to turn to when our lives
Where in a bind
And they made their house from a tool shed
Granddaddy rolled down on two logs
And they built walls all around it and they made
That house a home
And they taught us about good living
They taught us right from wrong
Lord theyÃ¢ll never be another place in this world
That I'll call home
My mama raised five children, four girls then their was me
She found her strength with faith in God and love of family
She never had a social life, home was all she knew
Except the time she took a job to pay a bill or two
My daddy skinned his knuckles on the cars that he repaired
He never earned much money, but he gave us all he had
He never made the front page but he did the best he could
And folks drove their cars from all around
To let him look underneath the hood
And they made their house from a tool shed
Granddaddy rolled down on two logs
And they built walls all around it and they made

Keep an eye on her while he was gone

That mansions crumblin' down

You drive down to the lake and then you turn back around
You go to school and you learn to read and write
So you can walk into the county bank and sign away your life
Now I work at the fillin station on the interstate
I'm pumpin gasoline and countin out of state plates
They ask me how far into Memphis son and where's the nearest beer
They don't even know that there's a town around here
Someday I'm finally gonna let go
Cause I know there's a better way
And I wanna know what's over that rainbow
I'm gonna get out of here someday       someday
Now my brother went to college cause he played football
I'm still hangin' round cause I'm a little bit small
I got me a 67 Chevy she's low and sleek and black
Someday I'll put her on that interstate and never look back
Someday I'm finally gonna let go

43,Nebraska Album,Bruce Springsteen,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bruce-springsteen/nebraska-chords-813583,"I saw her standin' on her front lawn just twirlin' her baton
Me and her went for a ride sir and ten innocent people died
From the town of Lincoln Nebraska with a sawed off .410 on my lap
Through to the badlands of Wyoming I killed everything in my path
I can't say that I'm sorry for the things that we done
At least for a little while sir me and her we had us some fun
Now the jury brought in a guilty verdict and the judge he sentenced me to death
Midnight in a prison storeroom with leather straps across my chest
Sheriff when the man pulls that switch sir and snaps my poor head back
You make sure my pretty baby is sittin' right there on my lap
They declared me unfit to live said into that great void my soul be hurled
They want to know why I did what I did
Well sir I guess there's just a meanness in this world
Well they blew up the chicken man in Philly last night
Now they blew up his house too
Down on the boardwalk they're gettin' ready for a fight
Gonna see what them racket boys can do
Now there's trouble busin' in from outta state
And the D.A. can't get no relief
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade
And the gamblin' commission's hangin' on by the skin of its teeth
Well now everything dies baby that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Well I got a job and tried to put my money away
But I got debts that no honest man can pay
So I drew what I had from the Central Trust
And I bought us two tickets on that Coast City bus
Now baby, everything dies baby that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Now our luck may have died and our love may be cold but with you forever I'll stay
We're goin' out where the sand's turnin' to gold
So put on your stockin's baby `cause the night's getting cold
And everything dies baby that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Now I been lookin' for a job but it's hard to find
Down here it's just winners and losers
And don't get caught on the wrong side of that line
Well I'm tired of comin' out on this losin' end
So honey last night I met this guy and I'm gonna do a little favour for him
Well I guess everything dies baby that's a fact
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back
Put your hair up nice and set up pretty
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City
And meet me tonight in Atlantic City
Will you  meet me tonight in Atlantic City
There's a place out on the edge of town sir
Risin' above the factories and the fields
Now ever since I was a child I can remember that mansion on the hill
In the day you can see the children playing
On the road that leads to those gates of hardened steel
Steel gates that completely surround sir the mansion on the hill
At night my daddy'd take me and we'd ride
Through the streets of a town so silent and still
Park on a back road along the highway side
Look up at that mansion on the hill
In the summer all the lights would shine
There'd be music playin' people laughin' all the time
Me and my sister we'd hide out in the tall corn fields
Sit and listen to the mansion on the hill
Tonight down here in Linden Town
I watch the cars rushin' by home from the mill
There's a beautiful full moon rising above the mansion on the hill
Well they closed down the auto plant in Mahwah late that month
Ralph went out lookin' for a job but he couldn't find none
He came home too drunk from mixin'Tanqueray and wine
He got a gun shot a night clerk now they call him Johnny 99
Johnny's wavin' his gun around and threatenin' to blow his top
When an off duty cop snuck up on him from behind
Out in front of the Club Tip Top they slapped the cuffs on Johnny 99
Well the city supplied a public defender but the judge was Mean John Brown
He came into the courtroom and stared poor Johnny down
Well the evidence is clear gonna let the sentence son fit the crime
Prison for 98 and a year and we'll call it even Johnny 99
A fistfight broke out in the courtroom they had to drag Johnny's girl away
His mama stood up and shouted Judge don't take my boy this way
Well son you got any statement you'd like to make
Before the bailiff comes to forever take you away
The bank was holdin' my mortgage and they was takin' my house away
Now I ain't sayin' that makes me an innocent man
But it was more 'n all this that put that gun in my hand
And if you can take a man's life for the thoughts that's in his head
Then won't you sit back in that chair and think it over judge one more time
And let 'em shave off my hair and put me on that execution line
My name is Joe Roberts I work for the state
I'm a sergeant out of Perrineville barracks number 8
I always done an honest job as honest as I could
I got a brother named Franky and Frank he ain't no good
Now ever since we was young kids it's been the same come down
I get a call on the shortwave Franky's in trouble downtown
Well if it was any other man, I'd put him straight away
But when it's your brother sometimes you look the other way
Yeah, me and Franky laughing and drinking nothing feels better than blood on blood
Takin' turns dancin' with Marie as the band played Night of the Johnstown Flood
I catch him when he's straying like any brother would
Man turns his back on his family well he just ain't no good
Well Franky went in the army back in 1965
I got a farm deferment, settled down, took Maria for my wife
But them wheat prices kept on dropping 'till it was like we were getting robbed
Franky came home in `68, and me, I took this job
Yea we're laughing and drinking nothing feels better than blood on blood
Takin' turns dancin' with Marie as the band played Night of the Johnstown Flood
I catch him when he's straying, teach him how to walk that line
Man turns his back on his family he ain't no friend of mine
Well the night was like any other, I got a call `bout quarter to nine
There was trouble in a roadhouse out on the Michigan line
There was a kid lying on the floor lookin' bad bleedin' hard from his head
There was a girl crying at a table and it was Frank, they said
Well I went out and I jumped in my car and I hit the lights
But I must of done a hundred and ten through Michigan county that night
It was out at the crossroads, down round Willow bank
Seen a Buick with Ohio plates behind the wheel was Frank
'till a sign said Canadian border five miles from here
I pulled over to the side of the highway and watched his taillights disappear
Me and Franky laughing and drinking nothing feels better than blood on blood
Taking turns dancing with Marie as the band played Night of the Johnstown Flood
I catch him when he's straying like any brother would
Man turns his back on his family well he just ain't no good
New Jersey Turnpike riding on a wet night
'neath the refinery's glow, out where the great black rivers flow
License, registration, I ain't got none but I got a clear conscience
About the things that I done
Please don't stop me, please don't stop me
The only thing that I got's been bothering me my whole life
Please don't you stop me, please don't you stop me
Radio relay towers gonna lead me to my baby
It's just talk, talk, talk, talk, till you lose your patience
Mister state trooper, please don't stop me
Oh, Oooh oh
Hiho silver-o, deliver me from nowhere
Oh, Ooh
My little sister's in the front seat with an ice cream cone
My Ma's in the black seat sitting all alone
As my Pa steers her slow out of the lot
For a test drive down Michigan Avenue
Now, my Ma, she fingers her wedding band
And watches the salesman stare at my old man's hands
If he could, but he just can't
Well if I could, I swear I know just what I'd do
Now, mister, the day the lottery I win I ain't
Ever gonna ride in no used car again
Now, the neighbors come from near and far
As we pull up in our brand new used car
I wish he'd just hit the gas and let out a cry
And tell 'em all they can kiss our asses goodbye
My dad, he sweats the same job from mornin' to morn
Me, I walk home on the same dirty streets where I was born
Front seat blowing that horn
The sounds echoing all down Michigan Avenue
Now, mister, the day my numbers comes in I ain't
Ever gonna ride in no used car again
Propped her up in the backyard on concrete blocks
For a new clutch plate and a new set of shocks
Took her down to the carwash, check the plugs and points
Well, I'm going out tonight I'm gonna rock that joint
Gotta find a gas station, gotta find a payphone
This turnpike sure is spooky at night when you're all alone
Gotta hit the gas, baby, I'm running late
This New Jersey in the morning like a lunar landscape
Now, the boss don't dig me, so he put me on the nightshift
In the wee wee hours your mind gets hazy
Radio relay towers, won't you lead me to my baby?
Underneath the overpass, trooper hits his party light switch
Goodnight good luck one two power shift
Bob's Big Boy Fried Chicken on the front seat, she's sitting in my lap
We're wiping our fingers on a Texaco roadmap
I remember Wanda up on scrap metal hill with them big brown eyes
Well, at five AM oil pressure's sinking fast
Gotta call my baby on the telephone
Let her know that her daddy's coming on home
Sit tight, little mama, I'm a coming round
I got three more hours, but I'm covering ground
Radio's jammed up with gospel stations
Lost souls calling long distance salvation
Hey, mister DJ, wont ya hear my last prayer
Hey, ho, rock'n'roll, deliver me from nowhere
Hey a lay da di da lay da di da da yodle
Last night I dreamed that I was a child
Out where the pines grow wild and tall
I was trying to make it home through the forest
Before the d..arkness falls
I heard the wind rustling through the trees
And ghostly voices rose from the fields
I ran with my heart pounding down that broken path
With the devil snappin' at my heels
I broke through the trees and there in the night
My father's house stood shining hard and bright
The branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms
But I ran till I fell, shaking in his arms
I awoke and I imagined the hard things that pulled us apart
Will never again, sir, tear us from each other's hearts
I got dressed, and to that house I did ride
From out on the road, I could see its windows shining in light
I walked up the steps and stood on the porch
A woman I didn't recognize came and spoke to me through a chained door
I told her my story and who I'd come for
She said I'm sorry, son, but no one by that name lives here anymore
My father's house shines hard and bright
It stands like a beacon calling me in the night
Calling and calling so cold and alone
Shining across this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned
Seen a man standing over a dead dog by the highway in a ditch
He's looking down kinda puzzled poking that dog with a stick
Got his car door flung open he's standin' out on highway 31
Like if he stood there long enough that dog'd get up and run
Struck me kinda funny seem kinda funny sir to me
Still at the end of every hard day people find some reason to believe
Now Mary Lou loved Johnny with a love mean and true
She said baby I'll work for you every day and bring my money home to you
One day he up and left her and ever since that
She waits down at the end of that dirt road for young Johnny to come back
Struck me kinda funny seemed kind of funny yeah indeed
How at the end of every hard earned day people find some reason to believe
Take a baby to the river Kyle William they called him
Wash the baby in the water take away little Kyle's sin
In a whitewash shotgun shack an old man passes away
Take his body to the graveyard over him they pray
Lord won't you tell us, tell us what does it mean
At the end of every hard earned day people find some reason to believe
Congregation gathers down by the riverside
Preacher stands with his Bible groom stands waiting for his bride
Congregation gone the sun sets behind a weeping willow tree
Groom stands alone and watches the river rush on so effortlessly
Wondering where can his baby be
Still at the end of every hard earned day people find some reason to believe

A shelter from the storm
It exists to give you comfort
It is there to keep you warm
And in those times of trouble
When you are most alone
The memory of love will bring you home
Perhaps love is like a window
Perhaps an open door
It invites you to come closer
It wants to show you more
And even if you lose yourself
And donât know what to do
The memory of love will see you through
Oh Love to some is like a cloud
To some as strong as steel
For some a way of living
For some a way to feel
And some say love is holding on
And some say letting go
And some say love is everything
Some say they donât know
Perhaps love is like the ocean
Full of conflict, full of pain
Like a fire when itâs cold outside
Thunder when it rains

Give me a, give me a, give me a redneck girl 
You've got to give me a, give me a, give me a redneck girl 
Oh, give me a, give me a, give me a redneck girl

48,Stranger In My House,Ronnie Milsap,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ronnie-milsap/stranger-in-my-house-chords-171076,"There's a silence here between us
 I've never heard before
And I can't find the love
In her eyes anymore
There're some changes going on
I'm beginning to understand
When I'm holding her
I swear I feel the presence of another man
There's a stranger in my house
Somebody's here that I can't see
Stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from
me
She sits staring out the window
A million miles away
And when I ask if she's alright
She never has too much to say
Is it somebody we both know
Somebody she just met
Is she loving him in her mind
While she's lying here in my bed
There's a stranger in my house
Somebody  here that I can't see
Stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from 
me - -
Suspicions lead to questions
and questions to alibis
Is it just my imagination
Or has her love turned into lies
There's a stranger in my house
Somebody  here that I can't see
Stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away - 
Stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
Stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away
Stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me  (repeat and fade ...)

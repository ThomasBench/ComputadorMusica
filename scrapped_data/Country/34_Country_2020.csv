Lookin' for someone to solve it all
Tired of the uproar and the useless information
I can't help but hear that highway stall
So now I'm rollin' on, get those wheels a-goin'
Ain't too late, oh it's the right time
Hold on, ain't no sign of slowin'
Pack it up and move on down the line
Everybody says, ""Go to school and get a job
Build yourself a prison where you'll die""
But I refuse to stand in line, baby, just to cut my wings
So, on this road, this bird was meant to fly
So now I'm rollin' on, get those wheels a-goin'
Ain't too late, oh it's the right time
Hold on, ain't no sign of slowin'
Pack it up and move on down the line
So now I'm rollin' on, get those wheels a-goin'
Ain't too late, oh it's the right time
Hold on, ain't no sign of slowin'
Pack it up and move on down the line

Listening to the station with a rockabilly rhythm
Down about Atlanta and I started slowing
Might need a little bit of something just to keep a-going
Mm, I got nothing
Nothing but a little cold coffee in a cup
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Birmingham never been a long time coming
All the way to Jackson, got the radio a-humming
Trying to make Dallas, but my head kept chugging
Wish I had a little 'cause I gotta keep the motor working
Mm, I got nothing
Nothing but a little cold coffee in a cup
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Last four miles, got my hand on the buckle
Gonna get some loving from a certain honeysuckle
He's my sugar and he's been there waiting
It's been a long time Betty, don't be hesitating
Mm, I got nothing
Nothing like enough
Nothing but a littlе cold coffee in a cup

For a second he wasn’t quite sure what it was
‘Till it tickled his face and he opened his eyes
On a beach in the French Summer Sun
With sulphur in the air and smell of something worse
He Leaned up on his elbow and looked around
Wiped some blood from his face and saw his buddy James
Mangled and torn apart on the ground
The medics got to him and he thanked God they did
He spent twenty-seven days in a field hospital
Before makin’ the slow trip home to the states
Minus one leg which still seemed impossible
He got a job sortin’ mail in the Birmingham post office
Five days a week enough pay to get by
He met a beautiful girl through a mutual friend and
Eleven months later that girl was his wife
Well the nightmares were often and so vivid and real
He'd wake up screamin' a few times a week
She was patient and kind and stayed by his side
And in time he found a more restful sleep
And by the next year they had 'em a son
Who got drafted when he turned eighteen
He went off to fight but he came back whole
Met my mom and they had me
And I come from a long line of soldiers
And their blood's still flowin' through me
And they fought in fields in foreign lands
So I could be who I wanted to be
Well I broke the streak and I went to college
Instead of Kabul or Kuwait
Got my degree and I got hired to teach
Shakespeare, Wordsworth and Yeats
In a decent sized high-school outside of Atlanta
I did the best that I could
That's heady stuff for kids that age
But all in all I think I did some good
And I come from a long line of soldiers
Whose blood's still flowin' through me
And they fought in fields in foreign lands
So I could be who I wanted to be
He heard the quiet buzzin' of a fly
For a second he wasn't quite sure what it was
'Til it tickled his face and he opened his eyes
Then he died there in that French summer sun
And that girl he wouldda met sortin' mail back in Birmingham
She met a lawyer and they fell in love
So their story ends before it began
On that beach in the French summer sun
And that child she had, well that wasn't my dad
And I wasn't ever his son
So my story ends before it began
On that beach in the French summer sun
And I come from a long line of soldiers
Whose blood flowed into the sea
And war took more than just one life
It took him and his son and me

Or old roller skates that fasten to the bottom of your shoes

Some say love's a meditation  on everything we are
Good, bad, and indifferent self-righteous and bizarre
It's right there in the crosshairs, our every last mistake
The sinners we've made holy, the saints we've burned at stake
If love is revelation and love we thus receive
It all comes down to knowing less than
Most of us alone believe
If you're asking me what love is, here's what I might say
You can find it out there anywhere on any given day
It's an endless stream of consciousness obtained in drips and drabs
And a chance to do the right thing when there's no one keeping tabs
If love is what we make it as you reap so you sow
The yang and yen the where and when
The first and last to come and go
Love is all creation
Love is manifest
It's love when we're all given life and
Love when we're all laid to rest

Wherever did it come from likely bird shit someone said
Just a random freak of nature that refuses to play dead
Oh to be that stand up straight past seven feet or more
Aye she ain’t no faux silk pansy boys what washed up on the shore
So let us stop and marvel for as long as we can spare
Seems you have no need for heaven when your hearts already there
 Would that I should be so bold,
 Greatest story never told
  Worth the wait in solid gold,
 Would that I should be so bold

 Titanic and the iceberg and the twain still yet to meet
I was running long side Jesus Christ plumed helmet and red cape
When I vowed unto the Prince of Peace to aid in his escape
When I felt the spear go in me from the right side to the left
I was streaming Mississippi see Bob Dylan, Love and Theft
When Jesus turned to thank me for the gift of second sight
I waved him off “No worries man, I think I’ll be alright”
 Would that I were born again,
 Makes no difference where or when
  Knowing now what I knew then
 Would that I were born again

To the blood falls in the Arctic it’s at least eight thousand clicks
You can get there as the crow flies headed north from Singapore

But if that ticking time bomb ‘neath the Yellowstone should blow

Won't need 'em tonight
Slip some blue jeans on
Get as laid back as you like
Leave your ID and your keys at home
Ain't no doorman with a wristband where we're going
Out there with the birds and the breeze
I'll bring the six string, you bring the melody
I'ma love you like an old country song all night long
Headlight slow dance, over the moon
Slide in like a steel, steal a kiss
Keep it real down home like a grand ole Nashville tune
Gonna put it on you like rain on a roof
Like change in the juke, three chords and the truth
Like an old, I'ma love you like an old
Old country song
Get you falling into me
Like a needle finds a groove
Where the green grass grows off a red-dirt road
Get you feeling everything but the blues
'Cause I'ma love you like an old country song all night long
Headlight slow dance, over the moon
Slide in like a steel, steal a kiss
Keep it real down home like a grand ole Nashville tune
Gonna put it on you like rain on a roof

I'ma love you like George Jones loved to drink
Like Johnny loved some June
I'ma love you like cowboy hats loved Hank
Make that old school feel brand new
I'ma love you like an old country song all night long

Slide in like a steel, steal a kiss
Keep it real down home like a grand ole Nashville tune

Walks these streets all around

With your neighbor down the block

With voices crying out, And sirens wailing away

Holds me steady when I'm spinnin' around
There's no mistakin' the real thing

I never ever wanted to be found
Lost inside the groove again with you, baby
This time I'm not messin' around
Well, my cool rockin' mama and lucky ol' me
We've got something that you wouldn't believe
Flyin' down lover's lane on cruise control
She's pickin' up what I'm puttin' down
Heart to heart without makin' a sound
There's no mistakin' the real thing
And I'm lost inside the groove again with you, baby

Lost inside the groove again with you, baby

You ease my mind when I get you all alone
All my worries start fading away
I'll save my trouble for a rainy day, alright
Well, my little mamacita means everything
Rockin' and rollin' like a 33
Drop that needle and spin around all night long
She picks me up like my favorite song
Hands a-clappin' and singin' along
There's no mistakin' the real thing

Boy, it’s hard to see anything coming with stars in your eyes
Does anybody wanna buy a half-ton van?
She’s got the V-8 engine and an Indiana tan
Your best offer is my worst fear
Why don’t you take her for a spin?
She’ll go anywhere, the dealer swore she can
Does anybody wanna buy a half-ton van?
Cold heat, hot air
Test drive her off the main road, she’s better than fair
That crack in the windshield’s what’s keepin’ the price way down
Don’t mind the holes, don’t mind the smell
Leaks a little oil, but you can barely tell
Been sittin’ on the lot for months, what a find I’ve found
Does anybody wanna buy a half-ton van
She’s got the 5.7, these are in-demand
You gotta keep in mind, they all run until they ran
She’ll go anywhere, just don’t make too many plans
Does anybody wanna buy a half-ton van?
Between you and me… It’s better than it seems
No lowballs, I know what I got in this thing
I was gonna take it through the auto-wash
But it needs some new weather-stripping
But if you take it off my hands, I’ll fill the tank for free
Does anybody wanna buy a half-ton van?
You’d be the envy of nearly every traveling band
Most of the cylinders are firing, and you don’t really need the ones that can’t
Just keep her away from snow, salt, and sand

47,Love Child,Kalie Shorr,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/kalie-shorr/love-child-chords-3830042,"Daddy came here on a boat
Mama came here on a plane
I got here by accident
But God doesn't make mistakes
He had something always lit up in his left hand
She was dragging 'round Jesus guilt
Seven half brothers and sisters
With our glasses all half-filled
I was a flower coming up through the pavement
Like a sad song ending in an amen
I'm a wild, wild, love child
Looking for a wild love
1969 on speed dial
And Woodstock in my blood
I was the messenger and the black sheep
A lone wolf, somewhere in bеtween
The soundtrack and the movie of
A wild, wild, lovе child
I was born twelve hundred feet from the ocean
Two hundred feet from a bar
A product of the old kind of passion
You only find in the back of a two-tone car
Where I heard 'Rhiannon' for the first time
My sister singing along for the last
Now she lives in the sky with the radio waves
Comes down when I play Fleetwood Mac
I'm a wild, wild, love child
Looking for a wild love
1975 on speed dial
And home was in my blood
I was the messenger and the black sheep
A lone wolf, somewhere in bеtween
The soundtrack and the movie of
A wild, wild, lovе chi-i-i-ild
I'm a Nirvana tattoo and a steel guitar
Oh oh oh oh
A church camp kid with tarot cards
Dancing to the beat of a broken heart
A wild, wild, love child
Looking for a wild love
1994 on speed dial
And 'Nevermind' in my blood
I was the messenger and the black sheep
A lone wolf, somewhere in between
The soundtrack and the movie of
A wild, wild, lovе child
The soundtrack and the movie of
A wild, wild, love child

But I can't say I won't someday
There were times when I thought I could feel it
To have it slip away
So I'm careful about good intentions
My own and the guy's next door
Whose hell I'll pay come the judgement day
Fair warning for to sin no more
What if God see's the need for religion
As something I can't share
For to righteously judge my brother
Seems such a needless use of prayer
And this thing bout the pearled gates of heaven
And those that would be denied
And here we are in an endless war
With God forever on our side
Praise be the life in me
Praise be the life in you
Sing, sing let freedom ring
  There will always be more work to do
As for love I was all in a hurry
To drink the taverns dry
And the walls I built around me
To keep my hopes up high
In time I was granted a vision
Of faces as of yet unknown
And a place somewhere in the great out there
Where I don't have to die alone
Praise be the life in me
Praise be the life in you
Sing, sing let freedom ring
  There will always be more work to do
Sing, sing let freedom ring
  There will always be more work to do

Hoping for better things
Like worms waiting for wings
And high school rings
Fight club was sold out
We went to see Inferno instead
You said I never even heard of it
But I liked karate kid
Who's that riding on the banks of the Rio Grande
It's Jean Claude Van Damme
It's Jean Claude Van Damme
Who's that riding on the banks of the Rio Grande
It's Jean Claude Van Damme
It's Jean Claude Van Damme
I can't make sense of this
Why some memories persist
Halfway through we left
And shared a cigarette
I can't go home
The way is dark and overgrown
Though your hand's in my hand
I fail to understand
Who's that singing in the land of the falling rain
I think it's Kurt Cobain
I think it's Kurt Cobain
Who's that singing in the land of the falling rain
I think it's Kurt Cobain
I think it's Kurt Cobain
In this recurring dream
2 swans on a rushing stream
Things are seldom as they seem
In a fevered dream
Into the fire
Into the fire they go
Far from the world they know
Into the fire they go

From the weight of my tears
But I just started laying my burdens down
I used to duck bullets from the rifle of fear
But I just started laying my burdens down
Oh, I'm laying them down
I just started laying my burdens down
Oh, I'm layin' 'em down
I just started laying my burdens down
The flesh ain't nothing but the bark on a tree
I just started laying my burdens down
The tree isn't nothing but the soul in me
I just started laying my burdens down
Oh, I'm layin' 'em down
I just started laying my burdens down
Oh, I'm layin' 'em down
I just started laying my burdens down
My soul took love on a hell of a ride
I just started laying my burdens down
My soul ain't nothing, but the car love drives
I just started laying my burdens down
Oh, I'm layin' 'em down
I just started laying my burdens down
Oh, I'm layin' 'em down
I just started laying my burdens down
Love said, ""Mama can I come on home?""
I just started laying my burdens down
And God said, ""Son you ain't never been gone""
I just started laying my burdens down
Oh, I'm layin' 'em down
I just started laying my burdens down
Oh, I'm layin' 'em down

1,Little Stream Of Whiskey,Doc Watson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/doc-watson/little-stream-of-whiskey-chords-1927711,"Just a mile west of the water tank on a cold November day
In a cold and lonesome boxcar a dyin' hobo lay
His pal sat there before him with a low and drooping head
Listenin' to the last words his dyin' buddy said.
Goodbye old pardner hobo I hate to say goodbye
But I hear my train a-comin' and I know she's a-getting nigh
Gonna tell that old conductor just where I want to stop
Where the little stream of whiskey comes flowing down the rocks.
We rode the rods together, we've rambled all around
In ev'ry kind of weather, we slept out on the ground
Oh, pardner don't you miss that train that always makes the stop
Where the little stream of whiskey comes flowing down the rocks.
Would you tell my girl in Danville that she need not to worry at all
I'm a-goin' to that country where I won't have to work a-tall
No I will not have to work there nor even change my socks
And the little stream of whiskey comes flowing down the rocks.
I'm a-goin' to that better place where ever'thing is right
Where the handouts grow on bushes and they sleep out ever' night
Won't have to wash my overhauls nor even change my socks
And the little stream of whiskey comes flowing down the rocks.

Can't stand the sight of myself
Lying in bed all day with the curtains drawn
Staring at the clock on the window ledge
The angry words you said come back so strong
Sometimes love quits
Oh when the pieces don't fit
And suddenly all your world falls to the floor
And all your wild days
Oh fall away
Can't see much point in them anymore
In this house of dreams
  I let you walk like a ghost unseen
  Girl on the day you left
Out walked my everything
Must have thought you'd always be there
I never even noticed when the changes came one day
Seems one minute you were standing close
I turned around again and girl you were far away
And every plan we made
Oh I just let them fade
And pile up on the floor beside the bed
   Now you're gone away
Oh but your memory stays
I sit here thinking of the things I never said
In this house of dreams
  I let you walk like a ghost unseen
  Girl on the day you left
Out walked my everything
Sometimes love quits
Oh when the pieces don't fit
And suddenly all your world falls to the floor

The land of endless malls
Images of Elvis flicks
Convertibles and blondes
And I remember cryin’
As you walked away along the shore
The last words I heard you say were what a bore
And I remember drinking
In those air-conditioned bars
Putting all my quarters in a juke-box
With big silver stars
And I remember Nat King Cole
Singing a song about the rain
Oh I'm feeling blue again----------
Oh yea I'm feeling blue again----
And it was just like a vacation
And I'm sure we had us some fun
It was just like a vacation
And I swear we even sat out in the sun
You see my mother owned a trailer home
On west Broward past A1A
And to beat the north wind
We took a spin
To that tin can by the sea
Well I thought she was mine
But she was just passing time
She even passed out of town in my car
And left me with Nat King Cole
And the silver stars
Whoa,   Nat King Cole and the silver stars
And it was just like a vacation
And I'm sure we had us some fun

She used to dream about him
And she'd wish upon a star
That one day he'd want her for his own
Throw caution to the wind
And with a grin he'd take her home
She's something of a dreamer
Something of a fool
Something of a heartbreak
When she gives her heart to you
And she used to hear his voice at night
A sweet whisper from the shadows
Dancing with the back porch light
And she used to feel him in the wind
His warm breath upon her neck
And goosebumps up and down her skin
She's something of a dreamer
Something of a fool
Something of a heartbreak
When she gives her heart to you
She should have known by now
But that's the foolish part of her
She should have seen somehow
But a dreamer's never cured
When heartbreak fast approaches
When a love ain't truly love
He promised wine and roses
And she thought that was enough
She's something of a dreamer
Something of a fool
Something of a heartbreak
When she gives her heart to you
She's something of a dreamer
Something of a fool
Something of a heartbreak
When she gives her heart to you
She's something of a dreamer
Something of a fool
Something of a heartbreak
When she gives her heart to you

Out on the floor the couples are swaying
To ""One Faded Love"" on the jukebox tonight

A slow country dance on a Saturday night
Sweethearts in love and others just lonely
Searching for someone to waltz with tonight
In a smoky old bar you know that it's only
A slow country dance on a Saturday night
And love's never easy or ever as true
When the changing of partners is no longer new
You lead with your heart, and closing your eyes
Dance just to dance in three-quarter time

Famous last words of a fool
The first night without her would be easy
I kept telling myself
All the while dying
At the thought of her lying somewhere else
And there'll be nothing to it
I'll easily find someone new

A devil when she held me close, an angel when she smiled.

And I still don't know why,
So, here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight.

And when she taught me how to care, I never cared so much.

Southern gales, tattered sails

I've seen things I'll always remember, some things I wish that I could forget
I haven't quite been around the world, but I've been around the block
I know that distances are meaningless like the hands that move around the clock
And I know that love is everywhere, always safe, always true
And exactly where it comes from is where it's going to

     Talk about opening windows, talk about opening doors
     My heart to yours...     Your heart to mine
     Love is the light that shines from heart to heart
Here I am sitting in old Hong Kong with the harbor and the lights
They're like diamonds in the heavens, enough to brighten the darkest nights
There's another side to sorrow as there is to everything
Like the other side of lonely is falling in love again
And then you know that there's an answer to the suffering you see
And though it isn't easy, it's still as simple as you and me
And you know that love is everywhere, always safe, always true
And exactly where it comes from is where it's going to

To smell the rose's fragrance, to hear the songbird's call
To watch the distant moonlight fill, the coming of the tides
To understand that life is more than always choosing sides
And some have seen what can be seen of sailing ships and kings
And some are given feet of clay and some are given wings
Some must struggle just to breathe, some have a golden spoon
And some will never leave the nest while some walk on the moon
And don't you know the life that lives within the silent hills
Is just as rich and beautiful and just as unfulfilled
As man with all his intellect, his reason and his choice
Oh, who's to say the nightingale has any less a voice
The silver dolphins twist and dance and sing to one another
The cosmic ocean knows no bounds for all that lives are brothers
The whippoorwill, the grizzly bear, the elephant, the whale
All children of the universe, all weavers of the tale
So palomino lie back down and dream yourself to sleep
The hawk flies with the morning dove, the lion with the sheep
As far away as you may go we'll never be apart
It's in your dreams that you will know the seasons of the heart

At a beautiful romance

There's no guarantee
We'll ever find love.
And in the songs that we share
The heartache is there
To remind us.
New love brings a thrill
And we know it always will
In a love song.
Happiness can leave
But it helps if we believe
In a love song.
There's a part of you and me
In every memory

Lost and alone in deep water

With the rules of survival in words

    You and I are what this love is for
And you're my only love - my only  love

If it’s the real thing me I feel that way
Knowing you must be there waiting for me somewhere
Some people say that I'm a fool
But I'm still looking for you
Yes I guess it's sad
The lovers I've been through some I could have had
They never were enough nobody measures up
Lovers and friends I've had a few
But I'm still looking for you
Maybe it's wrong I don't know
Maybe I'm just chasing rainbows
But its gotta be forever when I fall
But lately my hopes have been sinking
Lately I find I've been thinking
Maybe you're not really there at all
Tears and years go by
And I haven't found it seems the dream should die
But I hang on somehow still I keep reaching out
With all the loves that I've been through
I'm still looking for you

 The one I love forever .. doesn't love me anymore.
 So here I am heartache, .. my only friend
 Wrong end of the rainbow .. again.
 I was lookin' for true love .. but I didn't get far
 Before I tied all my heartstrings .. to some falling star.
 Now here I am heartache, .. my only friend
 Wrong end of the rainbow .. again.
 Between the winning and losing .. there's a very fine line.
 This time I felt like a winner, when I was losin' all the time.
 I get this rainy day feeling .. that I'm gonna be blue.
 I thought the day I found her .. I'd seen the last of you.

I’m reminded of the arms that held me tight
Last time I held you it ended all to soon
We were lying underneath a yellow moon
There’s a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky
Oh I wonder if you’re watching it too
There’s a yellow moon hanging in a starry sky
Wherever you are it’s watching over you
Oh shine on shine on yellow moon
Sometimes we sit and talk me and that old moon
I ask him are you happy or if you’re blue
I start to reminisce to a summers night in June
We fell in love under a yellow moon

Come on Son let's go out and play
Sometimes it seems like yesterday

When I was all by my-self
Grab his hat and fix the brim
Pretending I    was him 
No matter how hard I try
No matter how many tears I cry
No matter how many years go by
I still can't say good-bye
He always took care of Mom and me.
We all cut down a Christmas tree 
 He always had some time for me      
  Wind blows through the trees
Street lights, they still shine bright
  Moon   still looks the same

Saw a hat like my daddy wore       
Tried it on when I walked in
Still trying to be like him

No matter how many years go by
No matter how many tears I cry

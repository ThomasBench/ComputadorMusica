0,Hopefully,Zach Bryan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/zach-bryan/hopefully-chords-3020018,"Well I barely know if I'll be alive tomorrow
Let alone if the people I trust will stay
So what I'm needing while I'm breathing
Is to be content this evening
And find hope in tomorrow either way
And I don't think those city girls are right for me
Cause I don't fall for shallow pleasantries
And the conversation's nice,
But all the talking don't seem right
To a soul that prefers silence and the trees
And this world's expecting so much from the man
Who gets so wrecked on Saturdays, that he can barely stand
So if you could cut some slack, I got some good times on my lap
And I'd like to feel them all while I still can
Cause I got hope in tomorrow and regret in yesterday
so if you could find a way to forgive me
Then maybe I could find just a little peace of mind
And carry on tomorrow hopefully
And carry on tomorrow hopefully
And this world's expecting so much from the man
Who gets so wrecked on Saturdays, that he can barely stand
And I swear to ride this bronco until the wheels in my heart don't go
It's not your fault if they don't understand
Cause I got hope in tomorrow and regret in yesterday
so if you could find a way to forgive me
Then maybe I could find just a little peace of mind
And carry on tomorrow hopefully
And carry on tomorrow hopefully
And I went and talked to DeAnn at the bay
She told me that everything just might be okay
I know you're jaded and you're faded 
And you're pissed off at the world
But you can only be the man you are today
Cause I got hope in tomorrow and regret in yesterday
so if you could find a way to forgive me
Then maybe I could find just a piece of peace of mind
And carry on tomorrow hopefully
And carry on tomorrow hopefully

And we’re alone for the first time
On Venice beach under the palm trees
Tell me your dreams and I'll tell you mine
What would you say if I told you
You're my last thought at the end of each night?
Would you believe me
Or would you even reply?
Would you?
Would you?
Would you?
Would you?
I am a loner, I am stubborn
Can you handle this world I live in?
I know I can’t change, but for you I'd compromise
I'd be on your side if you'd be on mine
Yes, you're anxious and you're stubborn too
But I'd learn to love the worst parts of you
Could be the full moon or this cheap wine
But I'm hoping you’ll reply
Would you?
Would you?
Would you-u-u ?
Would you?
Is it in the stars or some age old truth?
Why did the universe draw me to you?
You’re so magnetic, I am hypnotized
Feels like I've known you since before this life
I hope I always see you this way
Here’s to wondering if you feel the same
But I can tell when your eyes meet mine
That the truth is in your reply
You do
You do
You do
You do

Shoot out of the night
And burn up before I could blink
Snowflakes and diamonds
Daisies and lightning
We'll never take it all in
So why do we close our eyes
When we pray, cry, kiss, dream
Maybe the most beautiful things in this life
Are felt and never seen
I've seen a picture
Of what this world looks like
Lookin back down from the moon
Satellite photos like brush strokes and Van Goghs
All shades of God's green and blue
Melting and swirling
Peaceful and twirling
Heaven's already around us
So why do we close our eyes
When we pray, cry, kiss, dream
Maybe the most beautiful things in this life
Are felt and never seen, and never seen.
            never seen.

 The flowers are dyin' like all things do
 Follow me close, I’m  going to Ballinalee
 I'll lose my mind if you don't come with me
 I fuss with my hair, and I fight blood feuds
 I contain multitudes
Got a tell-tale heart, like Mr. Poe
 Got skeletons in the walls of people you know
 I’ll drink to the truth and the things we said
 I'll drink to the man that shares your bed
 I paint landscapes, and I paint nudes
 I contain multitudes
Red Cadillac and a black moustache
Rings on my fingers that sparkle and flash
Tell me, what's next? What shall we do?
 Half my soul, baby, belongs to you
I rolic and I frolic with all the young dudes
I contain multitudes
   I'm just like Anne Frank, like Indiana Jones
 And them British bad boys, The Rolling Stones
   I go right to the edge, I go right to the end
I go right where all things lost are made good again
I sing the songs of experience like William Blake
 I have no apologies to make
 Everything's flowing all at the same time
 I live on the boulevard of crime
I drive fast cars, and I eat fast foods
I contain multitudes
 Pink petal-pushers, red blue jeans
 All the pretty maids, and all the old queens
All the old queens from all my past lives
 I carry four pistols and two large knives
I'm a man of contradictions, I'm a man of many moods
 I contain multitudes
         You greedy old wolf, I'll show you my heart
But not all of it, only the hateful parts
        I’ll sell you down the river, I’ll put a price on your head
What more can I tell you? I sleep with life and death in the same bed
 Get lost, madam, get up off my knee
 Keep your mouth away from me
I'll keep the path open, the path in my mind
I’ll see to it that there's no love left behind
I'll play Beethoven's sonatas, and Chopin’s preludes
 I contain multitudes

I ain’t spoke to you in years,
Often times, boys from this town,
put wheels down and disappear,
Mrs. Cole asked about you just three days back,
and I had no answer to give her,
I told her that you moved way out west,
to write some songs and grow a little more bitter,
The kids talk about you around here
like you’re some kind of legend
I wonder if they know a thousand sunrises ago you were eager just like them.
But if you ever decide to bring your pain and your pride
back to this side of Oklahoma City,
There’ll be a porch light on, from the post you leaned on
before you wound up on the wrong side of pity,
Often times I pray for you and often times I don’t,
is it the goodbyes that haunt you or the fear of new hellos,
You never stay long cause you won’t stop your running,
you’ll wait for tomorrow until tomorrow’s not coming.
Heard you landed in Tulsa while he slipped away,
Is that the reason your fleeing the fields we hauled hay,
The heat this July or the dark last December,
Look in my eyes and you might remember,
The weed out in Norman or the Stillwater strip,
Run far enough boy and you’re bound to trip.
But if you ever decide to bring your pain and your pride
back to this side of Oklahoma City,
There’ll be a porch light on, from the post you leaned on
before you wound up on the wrong side of pity,

Tall tales and hearsay and absolute lies
Been passed off as factual when actually, the actual
Causes they're awkwardly blockin' the way
Keeping us all from enjoyin' our evening
Shoving its roots through the screens in our face
Now, what would you get if you heard my opinion
Conjecturin' on matters that I ain't never dreamed
In all my born days as a white boy from Hickman
Based on the way that the world's been to mе?
It's called me belligеrent, it's took me for ignorant
But it ain't never once made me scared just to be
Could you imagine just constantly worryin'
Kickin' and fightin', beggin' to breathe?
How many boys could they haul off this mountain
Shoot full of holes, cuffed and laid in the streets
Til we come in to town in a stark ravin' anger
Looking for answers and armed to the teeth?
Thirty aught sixes, Papaw's old pistol
How many, you reckon, would it be, four or five?
Or would that be the start of a long, violent history
Tuckin' our tails as we try to abide?

So old they could not stand.

And his meat I could not chaw,

With the waggin' of his jaw.

That could lie like Diamond Joe.

But he did argue so

And it's my time to go,

Give the fleas to Diamond Joe.

Work a Saturday just for fun
Then come home and drink a hot beer
Come home and drink a hot beer

48,Tennessee,Sturgill Simpson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/sturgill-simpson/tennessee-chords-3492629,"I’ve been going out of my mind for a while now
Trying to find my way back home, I don’t know how
Oh I’m all the way up here in Kentucky seeing things clear
Through a haze of whiskey, tears, and misery
While you’re all the way down there in Tennessee
I been going at it a little hard of late it might seem
Been waking up every day in the same bad dream
Taking long walks at night, seeing things in a much bluer light
That old moon and your memory following me
Cause you’re all the way down there in Tennessee
They say in Tennessee, the sun is always shining
But this blue moon glowing on me, has got mе pining
I been trying to find my way back, with no luck so far
And the hardest part is just knowing how close you arе
Two hundred and ten mile drive, three hours down south 65
But it feels like there’s an ocean between you and me
Cause you’re all the way down there in Tennessee

Got no idea where it goes when it leaves
When it's here, it's here, when it's gone, it's gone
Kinda like them smoky mountain fall time trees
I guess I'll leave it to something bigger to figure it all out
But I sure could use a little breeze right now
Yeah, if anybody out there somewhere
Got a secret they wanna sharе
On why it does to her what it does to dust
It rеally just ain't fair
And why it always takes her with it
And only brings her back now and then?
I guess I've always been
Wonderin' 'bout the wind
She sits there like a feather just waitin' on a gale
By the time I pushed off she already caught sail
I'm always waitin' to put my anchor down
But I sure could use a little breeze right now
Yeah, if anybody out there somewhere
Got a secret they wanna share
On why it does to her what it does to dust
It really just ain't fair
And why it always takes her with it
And only brings her back now and then?
I guess I've always been
Wonderin' 'bout the wind
Hey, I can taste the rain, I can see the sun
And that makes sense to me
But this feels like one I that I can't outrun
Guess I'm runnin' just to see
If anybody out there somewhere
Got a secret they wanna share
On why it does to her what it does to dust
It really just ain't fair
And why it always takes her with it
And only brings her back now and then?
I guess I've always been
Wonderin' 'bout the wind
And why it always takes her with it
And leaves me hangin' on a limb
Just wonderin' 'bout the wind
Aw, wonderin' 'bout the wind

0,Two Hands (ver 2),Townes Van Zandt,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/townes-van-zandt/two-hands-chords-3326396,"I got two hands
I wanna clap my hands together
I got two legs
I wanna dance to heaven door
I got one heart
I'm gonna fill it up with Jesus
and I ain't gonna think about trouble anymore
Well now this old world sometimes it does get lonesome
and its many a grown man has hung his head and cried
down in your soul there's one that won't desert you
ain't it fine to have the Savior by your side
I got two hands
I wanna clap my hands together
I got two legs
I wanna dance to heaven door
I got one heart
I'm gonna fill it up with Jesus
and I ain't gonna think about trouble anymore
now the Lord resides inside a house of golden
and faith is the door and love is the key
and warm is the light pouring from his mighty windows
and that light, my friend, it shines on you and me
I got two hands
I wanna clap my hands together
I got two legs
I wanna dance to heaven door
I got one heart
I'm gonna fill it up with Jesus
and I ain't gonna think about trouble anymore
When the wind blows on that faithful morning
and I close my eyes, Lord, and fly my body home
I don't want my friends to cry no tears about me
I'll be bathing in the glory of the throne
I got two hands
I wanna clap my hands together
I got two legs
I wanna dance to heaven door
I got one heart
I'm gonna fill it up with Jesus
and I ain't gonna think about trouble anymore

That ain't right, that ain't wrong

Well, I keep on tryin' but it's been so long
If I hurt you, I did not mean to
I beg you pardon, I did not want to
When I leave you, don't you think about me?
Well, I won't be back babe, I'll be long gone
When the time comes and I'm not ready
Seems it's over before I'm started
Well, the time comes and I don't feel it
I don't know nothin' but my own

He can lead you to light through the darkest of days
And with His love wrapped around you, you can't go astray
When He offers his hand, don't you turn Him away.
In a world full of trouble, a world full of hate
You can't wait for tomorrow for tomorrow's too late.
Come and stand 'mongst the pilgrims in their golden array
When He offers His hand, don't you turn Him away.
When He offers His hand, don't you turn Him away
He can lead you to light through the darkest of days
And with His love wrapped around you, you can't go astray
When He offers his hand, don't you turn Him away.
It don't take an apostle just to answer His call.
And it don't take a pilgrim to stand up and say
When He offers His hand, don't you turn Him away.
When He offers His hand, don't you turn Him away
He can lead you to light through the darkest of days
And with His love wrapped around you, you can't go astray
When He offers his hand, don't you turn Him away.
Well I hope as I'm leavin', my message is clear,
It's a fool that would turn down a gift that's so dear.
Well He offered His blood, our debts to repay,
Now He offers His hand, don't you turn Him away.

5,Fraternity Blues,Townes Van Zandt,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/townes-van-zandt/fraternity-blues-chords-3406262,"I decided to improve my social station
I joined a fraternal organization
Tucked in my shirt, signed on the line
Right away they set about to improve my mind
The car I drove, the books I read,
the food I ate, the booze I drank,
the girls I took out,
My breath
They said ""kid we don't much like the way you walk
and you're gonna have to change the way you talk""
They said ""your dress is kinda sluochy
Said you got to learn to bubble
You got to bubble with enthusiamm,
I started bubblin'
The most important thing you can't forget
Is learning the entire Greek alphabet
how that's gonna' make me any more of a man
But I learned it
I can rip through that son-of-a-beta backwards in 5 seconds
Then they hit me with some pretty bad news
Concerning the payment of monthly dues
I never did know where that money went
but I paid it
I'm no trouble causer and besides, I figured that's life
If you want good friends, they're gonna cost ya
Well it finally got to be party time
I got a great big ole jug of wine
I went back to the house in about an hour
Brandy alexanders and frozen dqauaris
Reciting the greek alphabet to one another
I could see I was gonna have to do my very best
To get myself out of that fraternity mess
So I stood right there outside the door
And I chugged that wine like never before
Walked inside and bubbled -
all over a couple of their dates
So now everything is back to normal again
but there is still lots of room for improvement, friend
Of course that fraternity stuff's too much for me
Next time I'm gonna' join a sorotity
And really give em something to bubble about

The shoes are scuffed and worn

And the places that she's seen

Is not as haughty as she seems

With ordinary dreams 
And he brought her to this world

Spending her days on the train.
She's a semi good looker,  but the fast rails they took 'er,
Now she's tryin', just tryin' to get home again.
South Station in Boston to the freight yards of Austin,
From the Florida sunshine to the New Orleans rain.
Now that the rail packs have taken the best tracks,
She's tryin', just tryin' to get home again.
Once a highballin' loner, he thought he could own 'er,
Bought her a fur coat and a big diamond ring.
She hocked them for cold cash, left town on the Wabash,
Never thinkin', never thinkin' of home 'way back then.
But the rails are now rusty, the dining cars dusty,
The gold plated watches have taken their toll.
The railroads are dying, and the lady, she's crying,
On a bus to Kentucky, and home that's her goal.
She's a railroad lady, just a little bit shady,
Spending her life on the trains.
Once a Pullman car trav'ler, now the brakeman won't have her,

Turn this ship around boys, before we run aground
The Fish Aren't Biting Today boys, Fish Aren't Biting Today
I’m gonna lay on my bunk and get drunk as a skunk
Cause The Fish Aren't Biting Today.
There's six-foot waves and my stomach craves
Some good old Antiguan rum
I put some away for a rainy day
And the rain she's starting to come now.
There's a northern wind and the lights are dim
Like a good fresh Cuban cigar
I got me a hutch where there might be a bunch
In the captains pickle jar.
The Fish Aren't Biting Today boys, Fish Aren't Biting Today
I’m gonna lay on my bunk and get drunk as a skunk
Cause The Fish Aren't Biting Today.

Thinking I never got close enough to stay
Time runs in and then runs out
Starts again and it's always been that way
You're going to drown tomorrow
If you cry too many tears for yesterday
Tomorrow's half of all you've got, so
Treat him good, cause when I'm gone, he'll stay
I won't be forgetting you
You won't be forgetting me, I know
If memory comes a summer cloud
Rains her sweetness down to me below
I see you like you look right now
Maybe wonder why I had to go
But Heaven is the way she is
Rain falls and rivers flow
So here's to feeling good
And here's to feeling bad
Here's to being thankful
Sorry for the pleasures that we had
And autumn days, and window panes
God, forgive us if you feel deceived
The clock don't know you like I do
It's only him or me you got to believe

Today my bus pulled out of old Kentucky
My daddy waved and mama cried and I felt all choked up inside
Cause I was leavin' everyone that loved me.
The first I saw of city ways went against how I was raised
This country girl was really out of place
And I was set to go back home but I was broke and all alone
And I couldn't find another friendly face.
But I didn't have the bus fare to Kentucky
Or this city would have seen the last of me
I didn't have the bus fare to Kentucky
And that old Grey Dog won't let me ride for free.
I met a boy from Tennessee and I guess he reminded me
Of someone that I knew in old Kentucky
It was good to have a friend and it was good to laugh with him
And it was good to hear him say he loved me.
I never thought he'd do me wrong so I gladly went along
I loved him more than any man I've known
And after he had all his fun he told me that our love was done
And then he left this country girl alone.
But I didn't have the bus fare to Kentucky
Or this city would have seen the last of me
I didn't have the bus fare to Kentucky
And that old Grey Dog won't let me ride for free.
I can't afford to go first class so I'll make it the best I can
Anything to get my feet on that good Kentucky land
My thumb is in the air and my suitcase by my side
Won't somebody give this poor old country girl a ride.
Kentucky I'm a comin' home I'll never leave you anymore
Kentucky I don't know why I ever strayed
Kentucky your bluegrass bridges and your valleys call to me
Kentucky I'm comin' home to stay
Kentucky I'm a comin' home I'll never leave you anymore...

But he kept his faith in Jesus all along
It's a long way from Graceland across Jordan to the Promised Land

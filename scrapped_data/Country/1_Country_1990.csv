We mighta took the long way, We knew we'd get there someday
They said, ""I bet they'll never make it""
But just look at us holding on
We're still together still going strong
You're still the one
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
You're still the one
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night
Ain't nothin' better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missin'
They said, ""I bet they'll never make it""
But just look at us holding on
We're still together still going strong

I showed up in boots
And ruined your black tie affair
The last one to know
The last one to show
I was the last one you thought you'd see there
And I saw the surprise
And the fear in his eyes
When I took his glass of champagne
I toasted you
Said honey we may be through
But you'll never hear me
Complain
'Cause I got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away
And I'll be okay
I'm not big on social graces
Think I'll slip on down to the oasis
'Cause I've got friends
In low places
Well, I guess I was wrong
I just don't belong
But then, I've been there before
Everything's alright
I'll just say goodnight
And I'll show myself to the door
Hey, I didn't mean
To cause a big scene
Just give me an hour and then
I'll be as high as that
Ivory tower
 That you're livin'
in
'Cause I got friends in low places
Where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My blues away

Just wait 'til I finish this glass
Then sweet little lady
I'll head back to the bar
And you can
Kiss my ass!

My blues away
And I'll be okay

That lonesome feelin' comes to my door
An' the whole world turns... blue
There's a rundown bar across the railroad tracks
I got a table for two, way in the back
Where I sit alone... and I think of losin' you
I spend most every night beneath the light of a neon moon
Now, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon.
I think of two young lovers a-runnin' wild and free
 I close my eyes and sometimes see
 You in the shadows of this smoke-filled room
No tellin' how many tears I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies that I've lied 
Tellin' my poor heart she'll come back someday
Oh, but I'll be alright as long as there's light from a neon moon
If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon.
The jukebox plays on drink by drink
 And the words to ev'ry sad song seem to say what I think 
And this hurt inside of me, it ain't never gonna end 
Oh, but I'll be alright as long as there's light from a neon moon
If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon.
Watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
 Of a neon moon, ohhh
Watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon.

Raindrops on the windshield, there's a storm moving in
He's headin' back from somewhere that he never should have been
And the thunder rolls,       and the thunder rolls
Every light is burnin', in a house across town
She's pacin' by the telephone in her faded flannel gown
Askin' for a miracle, hopin' she's not right
Prayin' it's the weather that's kept him out all night

Another love grows cold     on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on    out of control
Deep in her heart     the thunder rolls
She's waitin' by the window when he pulls into the drive
She rushes out to hold him thankful he's alive
But on the wind and rain a strange new perfume blows
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes and he knows that she knows
And the thunder rolls    and the thunder rolls
And the thunder rolls    and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold     on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on    out of control
Deep in her heart     the thunder rolls
She runs back down the hallway to the bedroom door
She reaches for the pistol kept in the dresser drawer
Tells the lady in the mirror He won't do this again
Cause tonight will be the last time she'll wonder where he's been

Who's never left home, who's never struck out 
To find a dream and a life of their own 
A place in the clouds, a foundation of stone 
Many preceed and many will follow 
A young girl's dream no longer hollow 
It takes the shape of a place out west 
But what it holds for her, she hasn't guessed yet
She needs wide open spaces   Room to make her big mistakes
She needs new faces She knows the high stakes
She traveled this road as a child 
Wide eyed and grinning, she never tired 
But now she won't be coming back with the rest 
If these are life's lessons, she'll take this test 
She needs wide open spaces   Room to make her big mistakes
She needs new faces She knows the high stakes She knows the high stakes
As her folks drive away, her dad yells, ""Check the oil!"" 
Mom stares out the window and says, ""I'm leaving my girl"" 
She said, ""It didn't seem like that long ago"" 
When she stood there and let her own folks know

His heart wasn't in it
He just stole a kiss as he rode away
He never hung his hat up at Kitty's place

I should've learned to rope and ride
Wearing my six-shooter, riding by pony on a cattle drive
Stealing a young girl's heart

Singing those campfire songs
Oh I should've been a cowboy
I might of had a side kick with a funny name
Running wild through the hills chasing Jesse James
Ending up on the brink of danger
Riding shotgun for the Texas Rangers
Go west young man, haven't you been told
California's full of whisky, women and gold
Sleeping out all night beneath the desert stars
A dream in my eye and a prayer in my heart

All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H Club
Both active in the FFA
After graduation Mary Anne went out
lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town
And all she found was Earl
Well, it wasn't two weeks
After she got married that
Wanda started gettin' abused
She put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses
And make up to cover a bruise
Well, she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
She let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order
And put her in intensive care
Right away Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta
On a red eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand as they
Worked out a plan
And it didn't take 'em long to decide
That Earl had to die
Goodbye Earl
Those black-eyed peas
They tasted all right to me Earl
You're feelin' weak
Why don't you lay down
And sleep Earl
Ain't it dark
Wrapped up in that tarp Earl
The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house
High and low
Then they tipped their hats
And said ""thank you ladies, if you hear from him let us know""
Well, the weeks went by and
Spring turned to Summer
And Summer faded into Fall
And it turns out he was a missing person
Who nobody missed at all
So the girls bought some land
And a roadside stand
Out on Highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham
And strawberry jam
And they don't
Lose any sleep at night 'cause
Earl had to die
Goodbye Earl
We need a break
Let's go out to the lake Earl
We'll pack a lunch
And stuff you in the trunk Earl
Well, is that all right
Good, let's go for a ride

23,Seminole Wind,John Anderson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-anderson/seminole-wind-chords-60082,"    Ever since the days of old
Men would search for wealth untold
    They'd dig for silver and for gold
And leave the empty holes;
And way down south in the Everglades
Where the black water rolls and the saw grass waves
  The eagles fly and the otters play
In the land of the Seminole;
So blow, blow Seminole wind
Blow like you're never gonna blow again;
  I'm callin' to you like a long-lost friend
But I know who you are;
And blow, blow from the Okeechobee
All the way up to Micanopy
Blow across the home of the Seminole
The alligators and the gar
 Progress came and took its toll
 And in the name of flood control
 They made their plans and they drained the land
 Now the Glades are goin' dry
 And the last time I walked in the swamp
 I stood up on a cypress stump
 I listened close and I heard the ghost
 Of Osceola cry
So blow, blow Seminole wind
Blow like you're never gonna blow again;
  I'm callin' to you like a long-lost friend
But I know who you are;
And blow, blow from the Okeechobee
All the way up to Micanopy
Blow across the home of the Seminole
The alligators and the gar

The city's lookin' like a ghost town on a moonless summer night
Raindrops on the windshield, there's a storm moving in
He's headin' back from somewhere that he never should have been
And the thunder rolls,                    and the thunder rolls
Every light is burnin' in a house across town
She's pacin' by the telephone in her faded flannel gown
Askin' for a miracle, hopin' she's not right
Prayin' it's the weather that's kept him out all night
And the thunder rolls,                    and the thunder rolls
The thunder rolls   and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold   on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on    out of control
Deep in her heart   the thunder rolls
She's waitin' by the window when he pulls into the drive
She rushes out to hold him thankful he's alive
But on the wind and rain a strange new perfume blows
And the lightnin' flashes in her eyes and he knows that she knows
And the thunder rolls,                    and the thunder rolls
The thunder rolls   and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold   on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on    out of control
Deep in her heart   the thunder rolls     (to outro on original version)
She runs back down the hallway and through the bedroom door
She reaches for the pistol kept in a dresser drawer
Tells the lady in the mirror he won't do this again
'Cause tonight will be the last time she'll wonder where he's been
And the thunder rolls,                    and the thunder rolls
The thunder rolls   and the lightnin' strikes
Another love grows cold   on a sleepless night
As the storm blows on    out of control
Deep in her heart   the thunder rolls

And never knowing what's in store
Makes each day a constant battle
Just to stay between the shores.
And I will sail my vessel 'til the river runs dry,
Like a bird upon the wind these waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination if I never try
So I will sail my vessel 'til the river runs dry.
Too many times we stand aside and let the waters slip away
'Til what we put off 'til tomorrow has now become today
So don't you sit upon the shoreline and say you're satisfied
Choose to chance the rapids and dare to dance the tide.
And I will sail my vessel 'til the river runs dry,
Like a bird upon the wind these waters are my sky
I'll never reach my destination if I never try
So I will sail my vessel 'til the river runs dry.

34,That Summer (ver 3),Garth Brooks,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/garth-brooks/that-summer-chords-1503757,"I went to work for her that summer
A teenage kid so far from home
She was a lonely widow woman
Hell-bent to make it on her own
We were a thousand miles from nowhere
Wheat fields as far as I could see
Both needing something from each other
Not knowing yet what that might be
'Til she came to me one evening
Hot cup of coffee and a smile
In a dress that I was certain
She hadn't worn in quite a while
There was a difference in her laughter
There was a softness in her eyes
And on the air there was a hunger
Even a boy could recognize
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the skies
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Raging in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright
Rushing headlong in the wind
Now where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night
That summer wind was all around me
Nothing between us but the night
When I told her that I'd never
She softly whispered that's alright
And then I watched her hands of leather
Turn to velvet in a touch
There's never been a summer
When I have ever learned so much
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the skies
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Raging in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright
Rushing headlong in the wind
Now where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night
I often think about that summer
The sweat, the moonlight and the lace
And I have rarely held another
When I haven't seen her face
And every time I pass a wheat field
And watch it dancing with the wind
Although I know it isn't real
I just can't help but feel
Her hungry arms again
She had a need to feel the thunder
To chase the lightning from the skies
To watch a storm with all its wonder
Written in her lover's eyes
She had to ride the heat of passion
Like a comet burning bright
Rushing headlong in the wind
Now where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night
Rushing headlong in the wind
Now where only dreams have been
Burning both ends of the night

'Cause now she's gone and I am free
And she can't do a thing to me
I just wanna dance the night away
With senoritas who can sway
Right now tomorrow's lookin' bright
Just like the sunny mornin' light
I just wanna dance the night away
With senoritas who can sway
Right now tomorrow's lookin' bright
Just like the sunny mornin' light
I just wanna dance the night away
With senoritas who can sway
Right now tomorrow's lookin' bright
Just like the sunny mornin' light
I just wanna dance the night away
With senoritas who can sway
Right now tomorrow's lookin' bright
Just like the sunny mornin' light

46,Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under,Shania Twain,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/shania-twain/whose-bed-have-your-boots-been-under-chords-1472626,"Whose bed have your boots been under
And whose heart did you steal I wonder
This time did it feel like thunder, baby
Whose bed have your boots been under
Don't look so lonely, don't act so blue
I know I'm not the only girl you run to
I know about Lolita, your little Spanish flame
I've seen you around with Rita, the redhead down the lane
Whose bed have your boots been under
And whose heart did you steal I wonder
This time did it feel like thunder, baby
And who did you run to
And whose lips have you been kissin'
And whose ear did you make a wish in
Is she the one that you've been missin', baby
Well whose bed have your boots been under
I heard you've been sneakin' around with Jill
And what about that weekend with Beverly Hill
And I've seen you walkin' with long legs Louise
And you weren't just talkin' last night with Denise
Whose bed have your boots been under
And whose heart did you steal I wonder
This time did it feel like thunder, baby
And who did you run to
And whose lips have you been kissin'
And whose ear did you make a wish in
Is she the one that you've been missin', baby
Well whose bed have your boots been under
So next time you're lonely don't call for me
Try the operator, maybe she'll be free
Whose bed have your boots been under
And whose heart did you steal I wonder
This time did it feel like thunder....
Whose bed have your boots been under
And whose heart did you steal I wonder
This time did it feel like thunder, baby
And who did you run to
And whose lips have you been kissin'
And whose ear did you make a wish in
Is she the one that you've been missin', baby
Well whose bed have your boots been under
I wanna know... whose bed... etc.

Don't you know I've come a long, long, way?
 I been longin' to see her.
when she's around she takes my blues away.
Sweet Maria...
the sunlight surely hurts my eyes.
  I'm a lonely dreamer, on a highway in the skies.
Mar...i.....i...i...i...i.i.i.i........ia,
Mar...i.....i...i...i...i.i.i.i............ia,
My Maria...
there were some blue and sorrowed times.
Just my thoughts about you, bring back my peace of mind.
Gypsy lady... your a miracle worked for me.
You set my soul free, like a ship sailing on the sea.
She is the sunlight when the skies are gray
She treats me so right, lady, take me away
My  Mar...i.....i...i...i...i.i.i.i........ia,
Mar...i.....i...i...i...i.......ia I love you.

48,Standing Outside The Fire,Garth Brooks,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/garth-brooks/standing-outside-the-fire-chords-62618,"We call them cool
Those hearts that have no scars to show
The ones that never do let go
And risk the tables being turned
We call them fools
Who have to dance within the flame
Who chance the sorrow and the shame
That always comes with getting burned
But you got to be tough
When consumed by desire
Cause its not enough just to stand outside the fire
We call them strong
Those who can face this world alone
Who seem to get by on their own
Those who will never take the fall
We call them weak
Who are unable to resist
The slightest chance love might exist
And for that forsake it all
They're so hell bent on giving
Walking a wire
Convinced it's not living when you stand outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire
There's this love that is burning, deep in my soul
Constantly yearning to get out of control
Wanting to fly, higher and higher
I can't abide standing outside...    the fire
Standing outside the fire
Standing outside the fire
Life is not tried, it is merely survived
If you're standing outside the fire

'Cause my heart ain't ready for the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rockin' since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox play me a country song
Before you drop that quarter keep one thing in mind
You got a heartbroke hillbilly standing here in line
I've been down and lonely ever since she left
Before you punch that number could I make one request
Don't rock the jukebox I wanna hear some Jones
'Cause my heart ain't ready for the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rockin' since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox play me a country song
I ain't got nothing against rock & roll
But when your heart's been broken you need a song that's slow
There ain't nothin' like a steel guitar to drown a memory
Before you spend your money babe play a song for me
Don't rock the jukebox I wanna hear George Jones
My heart ain't ready for the Rolling Stones
I don't feel like rockin' since my baby's gone
So don't rock the jukebox play me a country song
So don't rock the jukebox play me a country song

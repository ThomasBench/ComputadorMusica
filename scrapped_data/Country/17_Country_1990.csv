0,Bad Timing (ver 3),Blue Rodeo,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/blue-rodeo/bad-timing-chords-1129586,"Hey its me, what a big surprise,
Calling you up from a restaurant round the bend
Just got in from way up north
Aching and tired now, and I could use a friend
Might be a fool to think that you do wanna see me again
I never meant to make you cry
And though I know I shouldn't call
It just reminds us of the cost
Oh, of everything we've lost
Bad timing that's all.
And maybe soon there'll come a day
When no more tears will fall
We each forgive a little bit,
Then we both look back on it
As just bad timing that's all.

1,Aint Necessarily So,Willie Nelson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/willie-nelson/aint-necessarily-so-chords-4035586,"You can't break your eggs to count your chickens
And you can't break your neck to keep your ducks all in a row
But don't think every chance you take has to mean a new mistake
- It ain't necessarily so
Now depending on the soil and the season
You can plant a seed and you can watch it grow
But you can't have a guarantee 'cause everything that aught to be
- Ain't necessarily so
I laugh when I can and I live with the rest
I learned that holdin' on means lettin' go
I try to be a friend to the person on my left
They say you just can't be too careful who you know
But that ain't necessarily so
I'd like to have more faith in human logic
Basin' all the rules on the proof that you can show
But I can't take my guesses back for that I based on all those facts
- That ain't necessarily so
And every time I follow what I'm feelin'
I end up in the same place my heart would have me go
There's one rule of life I trust, it's everything outside your gut
- Ain't necessarily so
I laugh when I can and I live with the rest
I learned that holdin' on means lettin' go
I try to be a friend to the person on my left
They say you just can't be too careful who you know
But that ain't necessarily so
I laugh when I can and I live with the rest
I learned that holdin' on means lettin' go

So many roads, but none that seem clear
If what we have enough, to last a whole life through?
Who knows, baby who knows
So you're asking me, what do we do
Cause time moves so fast and the chances seem so few
Is it too much to think, that we could have it all
Who knows, we may never know
But if I were you, I'd promise to live life for all it's worth
Take all that you've been given
And leave your mark upon this earth
Trust your heart so show you everything you'll ever need
And if I were you I'd fall in love with me
So hold me close, I'll kiss away your fears
I won’t promise the moon, but I'll promise to be here
And what if together it gets better every day

If I were you I'd fall in love with me

When she said, ""There's someone you should meet""
At a crowded restaurant way cross town
He waited impatiently
When she walked in their eyes met
And they both stared
And right there and then, everyone else disappeared   
But one boy, one girl, two hearts beating wildly
To put it mildly it was love at first sight
He smiled, she smiled, and they knew right away
This was the day they'd waited for all their lives
For a moment the whole world 
Revolved around one boy and one girl
In no time at all they were standing there
In the front of a little church
Among their friends and family
Repeating those sacred words
Preacher said, ""Son, kiss your bride""
And he raised her veil
Like the night they met time just stood still
For one boy, one girl, two hearts beating wildly
To put it mildly it was love at first sight
He smiled, she smiled, and they knew right away
This was the day they'd waited for all their lives
For a moment the whole world 
Revolved around one boy and one girl
He was holding her hand when the doctor looked up and grinned
""Congratulations, twins""
One boy, one girl, two hearts beating wildly
To put it mildly it was love at first sight

We are living proof, that love rem---ains.

Through it all love remains.
An eternal burning flame.
Hope lives on and love rem-ains.

She shows her face to ask me how I am

""Can you forgive me? I hope that you'll be happy.""
I'm so happy that I can't stop crying
I'm so happy I'm laughing through my tears
I saw a friend of mine.  he said, ""I was worried about you
I heard she had another man, I wondered how you felt about it

Joint custody and legal separ-ation
I'm so happy that I can't   stop crying
I'm laughing through my tears,
I'm laughing through my tears
I took a walk alone last night. I looked up at the
stars.  To try to find an answer in my life
I chose a star for me, I chose a star for him
I chose two stars for my kids and one star for my wife
Something made me smile.
Something seemed to ease the pain
Something about the universe and how it's all connected
The park is full of sunday fathers, and melted ice cream
We try to do the best, within the givin time
A kid should be with his mother, everybody knows that
What can a father do but baby-sit some-times?
I saw that friend of mine, he said, ""you look different somehow.""
I said, ""everybody's got to leave this darkness sometime.""  I say

Is there somebody waiting, was there a slip of the lip?
What Was It You Wanted? I ain't keeping score.
Are you the same person that was here before?
Is it something important? Maybe not
What Was It You Wanted? Tell me again I forgot
Whatever you wanted, what could it be?
Did somebody tell you that you could get it from me?
Is it something that comes natural? Is it easy to say?
Why do you want it? Who are you anyway?
Is the scenery changing, am I getting it wrong?
Is the whole thing going backwards, are they playing our song?
Where were you when it started? Do you want it for free?
What Was It You Wanted? Are you talking to me?

Lookin' in windows at things I could want
   There's Johnson's hardware and Morgan's jewelry
And the ol' Lee King's apothecary
They were the little man
The little man
   I go back now and the stores are all empty
Except for an old coke sign dated 1950
   Boarded up like they never existed
   Or renovated and called historic districts
There goes the little man
There goes the little man
Now the court square's just a   set of streets
That the people go round but they seldom think
Bout the little man that built this town
Before the big money shut em down
And killed the little man
Oh the little man
   He pumped your gas and he cleaned your glass
And one cold rainy night he fixed your flat
   The new stores came where you do it yourself
You buy a   lotto ticket and food off the shelf
Forget about the little man
Forget about that little man
   He hung on there for a few more years
But he couldn't sell slurpees, and he wouldn't sell beer
Now the bank rents the station
To a man down the road
And they sell velvet Elvis and second-hand clothes
There goes the little man
There goes another little man
Now the court square's just a   set of streets
That the people go round but they seldom think
Bout the little man that built this town
Before the big money shut em down
And killed the little man
Oh the little man
Now the stores are lined up in a concrete strip
You can buy the world with just one trip
   And save a penny cause it's jumbo size
And they don't even realize
They're killin' the little man
Oh the little man
Now the court square's just a   set of streets
That the people go round but they seldom think
Bout the little man that built this town
Before the big money shut em down
And killed the little man
Oh the little man

An old black man came with his mule and his plow
   He broke the ground where we grew our garden
Back before we'd all forgotten
About the little man
The little man
Long live the little man

Too often on your own
When you are moving in different directions
True love is all alone
Old stories start to surface
Patterns from long ago
And loving quickly turns to anger
For reasons they don't even know
The strongest heart can be broken
With one insensitive word
The deepest feelings remain unspoken
No one is seen and nothing heard
Two different directions
Too many different ways
One always wants to work things out
The other one wants to play
To ready for changes
To much that just can't wait
When you are moving in different directions
True love can turn to hate
If opposites attract each other
What's the reason for
One being like an open window
One just like a closing door
Two different directions
Two many different ways
One likes to see the morning sunrise
The other one sleeps in late
To many tomorrows
To many times too late
When you are moving in different directions
True love may have to wait
If you are committed to different directions
True love will have to wait

Captured on canvas
Alone in the portrait I would stand
And brush strokes bold
Yet soft as a whisper
The work of a feminine hand
Caught in a still life
Surrounded by shadows
Or lost in a background of blue
If I were a painting
My price would be pain
And the artist would have to be you
I imagine the colors
Would all run together
If you ever allowed me to cry
So don't paint the tears
Just let me remember me
Without you in my life
It's only the frame
That holds me together
Or else I would be falling apart
If I were a painting
I wouldn't fear
And you wouldn't be breaking my heart

much sense
Now that's turned more intense
And all the crutches you've kept around
Now are nowhere to be found
Remember when you didn't have
To look ahead or behind you
There was always something right there to do
But now it's life
in some kind of trap
Looking for a way out
We keep moving on that's what it's all about

  Dreamin' my life away and drinkin' beer
  Staying up till dawn strummin' on guitars
  Sleepin' all day long just like the big rock stars
  Barely livin' on money from tip jars
  I had a little place just up the block
  Had me a French girlfriend I loved the way she talked
  We spent our afternoons watchin' the TV
  Findin' things to do that we could do for free
  When we split up she said you don't do enough for me
  I am guilty of a dreadful selfish crime
  I had robbed myself of all my precious time
  Had my first gig here in the neighborhood
  We had a little band I thought was good
  Hocked my old shotgun bought a used P.A.
  We got a quart of rum drank it all that day
  When the big gig come we were just to drunk to play
  I am guilty of a dreadful selfish crime
  I had robbed myself of all my precious time
  I am guilty of a dreadful selfish crime
  I had robbed myself of all my precious time
  Sometimes I can't believe those days are gone
  Most of my friends back then have moved along
  One's in Hollywood one's a millionaire
  Some are gone for good some still livin' here
     Me I'm just the same lost in a crowd
  Lookin' for the rain in a thunder cloud
  I have moved around but it don't matter though
  One thing I have found there are just two ways to go
  It all comes down to livin' fast or dyin' slow

You're afraid of what you'll find, If you get too close
You imagine I don't care
You see walls that just aren't there
You think I'm too strong
To let you in well that's just not fair
  I'm not so tough I call your bluff
  And let you see a side of me
  That wants you here, and cries real tears
  And needs someone to love
  I'm not so tough
I know that you've been hurt before So have I
what can you do?
That doesn't mean you close the door
So stop blaming me, I don't blame you
I'm not some ghost from your past
The one who tore your heart in half
I'm not her, it's not my fault you're holding on to that

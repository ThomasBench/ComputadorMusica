0,Highway Patrolman (ver 3),Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/highway-patrolman-chords-1801413,"    My name is Joe     Roberts 
    I work for the    state 
I'm a    sergeant out of     Perrineville 
    Barracks number     eight  
I     always done an     honest job 
    Honest as I     could 
    Got a brother named     Frankie 
    Frankie ain't no     good  
    Ever since we were     young kids 
    It’s been the same come     down 
    I get a call on the    shortwave 
    Frankie's in trouble down -     town  
Well    if it was any    other man 
    I'd put him straight a -    way 
But    sometimes when it's your     brother 
    You look the other     way  
Yeah     me and Frankie laughin' and     drinkin' 
Nothin' feels     better than blood on     blood 
Takin'    turns dancin' with Ma -     ria 
While the    band played ""the    Night of the 
Johnstown     Flood""  
    I catch him when he's    strayin' 
    Like any brother    should 
    Man turns his back on his    family 
    He ain't no    good  
Well    Frankie went in the     army 
Back in    nineteensixty -    five 
    I got a farm de -    ferment, 
Settled    down, took Maria for my     wife  
But them    wheat prices kept on    droppin' 
Till it was    like we were gettin'    robbed 
    Frankie came home in     sixtyeight 
    Me, I took this    job 
Yeah    me and Frankie laughin' and    drinkin' 
Nothin' feels    better than blood on    blood 
    Takin' turns dancin' with Ma -    ria 
While the band played ""the    Night of the 
Johnstown    Flood""  
    I catch him when he's    strayin' 
    Teach him how to walk that    line 
    Man turns his back on his     family 
    Ain't no friend of    mine  
Well the    night was like any    other 
I got a    call `bout quarter to    nine 
There was    trouble in a    roadhouse 
Out on the Michigan     line 
There was a     kid on the floor    lookin' bad 
    Bleedin' hard from his    head 
There was a    girl cry'n' at a    table 
    It was Frank, she    said  
    I ran out and I    jumped in my car 
    Then I hit the    lights 
    I musta done a    hundred and ten 
Through    Michigan county that     night  
It was    down by the    crossroads, 
    Out by Willow    bank 
Seen a     Buick with O -     hio plates 
    Behind the wheel was    Frank  
Well I    chased him through them    county roads 
Till a    sign said ""Canadian border    five miles from here"" 
    Pulled over the     side of the highway 
    Watched his tail-lights    disappear 
Yeah    me and Frankie laughin' and    drinkin' 
Nothin' feels    better than blood on    blood 
    Takin' turns dancin' with Ma -    ria 
While the band played ""the    Night of the 
Johnstown     Flood""  
    I catch him when he's   strayin' 
    Like any brother    should 
Man turns his back on his     family 
He ain't no      good//

   I've done a thousand miles of thumbin',
   Yes, I've worn blisters on my heels
   Tryin' to find me somethin' better
   On the streets of Bakersfield

   Spent a night there in the can
   They threw this drunk man in my jail cell,
   I took fifteen dollars from that man
   I left him my watch and my old house keys,
   I don't like folks thinkin' that I'd steal
   Then I thanked him as he was sleepin',

She told him you'll forget in time
As the years went slowly by
She still preyed upon his mind
He kept her picture on his wall
Went half crazy now and then
He still loved her through it all
Hoping she'd come back again
Kept some letters by his bed
Dated 1962
He had underlined in red
Every single I love you
I went to see him just today
Oh but I didn't see no tears
All dressed up to go away
First time I'd seen him smile in years
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today
You know she came to see him one last time
Oh and we all wondered if she would
And it kept running through my mind
This time he's over her for good
He stopped loving her today
They placed a wreath upon his door
And soon they'll carry him away
He stopped loving her today

I get a call on the shortwave Franky's in trouble downtown
Well if it was any other man, I'd put him straight away
But when it's your brother sometimes you look the other way
Yeah, me and Franky laughing and drinking nothing feels better than blood on blood

I got a farm deferment, settled down, took Maria for my wife
But them wheat prices kept on dropping 'till it was like we were getting robbed
Franky came home in `68, and me, I took this job

for a new clutch plate and a new set of shocks
Took her down to the carwash check the plugs and points well

Early north Jersey industrial skyline 
Gotta find a gas station, gotta find a payphone 
This turnpike sure is spooky at night when you're all alone
Gotta hit the gas baby I'm runnin' late, 
This New Jersey in the mornin' like a lunar landscape
Now the boss don't dig me so he put me on the nightshift
In the wee wee hours your mind gets hazy 
Radio relay towers won't you lead me to my baby
Underneath the overpass trooper hits his party light switch
Goodnight good luck one two powershift
I met Wanda when she was employed behind 
Fried chicken on the front seat she's sittin' in my lap
We're wipin' our fingers on a Texaco roadmap
I remember Wanda up on scrap metal hill 
with them big brown eyes that make your heart stand still
5 A.M. oil pressure's sinkin' fast
Gotta call my baby on the telephone
Let her know that her daddy's comin' on home
Sit tight little mamma I'm commin' round 
I got three more hours but I'm coverin' ground
Your eyes get itchy in the wee wee hours 
Radio's jammed up with gospel stations 
Lost souls callin' long distance salvation
Hey Mister DJ won't ya hear my last prayer 
Hey ho rock 'n roll deliver me from nowhere

A coke and burger cost you thirty cents
I was still in love with Mavis Brown
On the night Hank Williams came to town
I Love Lucy debuted on TV
That was one big event we didn't see
Cause no one stayed at home for miles around
It was the night Hank Williams came to town
Momma ironed my shirt and daddy let me take the truck
I drove on out to Grapevine and picked old Mavis up
We hit that county line for one quick round
On the night Hank Williams came to town
A thousand people sweltered in the gym
Then I heard someone whisper hey that's him
That's when the crowd let out this deafening sound
It was the night Hank Williams came to town
On and on he sang into the night
Jambalaya, Cheating Heart, I Saw the light
How'd they get Miss Audrey in that gown
On the night Hank Williams came to town 
Mavis had her picture made with Hank out by his car
She said he sure is humble for a Grand Ole Opry star
Mavis said why don't we hang around
It ain't often that Hank Williams comes to town
While Hank signed his autograph on Beaulah Rizner's fan
Mavis got acquainted with the Drifting Cowboys Band
The effect on all our lives was quite profound

 Somedays she does what I tell her.
It's like dancing with a widow-maker, forty hours a week.
I'm talking about a, big old D-10 caterpillar.
 I don't know why? I like to drive'm like I do.
It ain't nothing but a hundred seventy-five thousand pounds of steel.
 Could be the money babe, could be the power.
 Could be I love the way it feels.
 Could be I love the way it feels.
 But you know she's mighty unforgiving and you gotta, pay attention.
Cause the, D-10 could be the death of you.
But I, get her all fired up and I, can feel it in my soul.
And it's hard to tell: Just who's driving who?
 I can move Alaska, all the way to Beirut.
I could, bulldoze a beeline, from here to Peru.
I could, push the Rocky Mountains, into the sea.
You know, Heavy metal, don't mean rock and roll to me.

 I'm like a, modern day mule skinner, driving ten thousand mules.
So I say a little prayer, every day.
Lord, just let me get her turned around.
Without, falling off this mountain.
You know the boss man, don't like us treating his D-10 that way.
 I don't know why? I like to drive'm like I do.

Manslaughter in the highest of degrees

And they make the ladies so sad

And in the morning he'd go

The New Jersey lady the day that he died
She covered him over with clay
And feeling the wind in the night as she cried

When the little blighter only cost me five.
The veterinary surgeon saw me coming,
But I had to keep my feathered friend alive;
He was shaking on his perch, the kids were crying,
The family gathered round his little cage.
I said I think it's time we got a new one,
That's when the family went into a rage.       
Oh, the waiting room ponged like a rat house,
With heartworms and lungworms and lice.
And a Persian had her eye on the shoebox,
I suppose she thought our budgie might be nice.
Well the bird s**t on the veterinary surgeon,
I heard him say the dirty little chick.
Guess he wondered why I didn't use my brains
And hit him over the head with a brick.
Oh antibiotics for his colour,
Two drops a day on his beak.
Some powder on the nose for his feathers
And clean out his cage twice a week.
Well it cost me thirty bucks to fix my budgie
When the little blighter only cost me five
And the bludger wakes me early in the morning,
It's got me puzzled how he survives.
One night I'll feed him to the tom cat.
Instead of worrying about him when we go away.
No-one wants to feed a s**tty budgie,
When everyone's on holiday

About laying to rest and then flying
How the moment at hand is the only thing we really own
And I lay in my bed and I wondered
After all has been said and is done for
Why is it thus we are here and so soon we are gone?
Is this life just a path to the place that we all have come from?
Does the heart know the way and if not, can it ever be found?
In a smile or a tear or a prayer or a sigh or a song?
And if so, then I sing for my father
And in truth you must know I would rather
He were here by my side; we could fly on the wings of a dream
To a place where the spirit would find us
And in joy and surrender would bind us
We are one anyway, anyway we are more than we seem
There are those who will lead us, protect us each step of the way
From beginning to end, for each moment, forever, each day
Such a gift has been given, it can never be taken away
Though the body in passing must leave us
There is one who remains to receive us
There are those in this life who are friends from our heavenly home
So I listen to the voices inside me
For I know they are there just to guide me
And my faith would proclaim it is so, we are never alone
From the life to the light, from the dark of the night to the dawn
He is so in my heart, he is here, he could never be gone
Though the singer is silent, there still is the truth of the song. . .in the song
Yesterday I had a dream about dying
About laying to rest and then flying
How the moment at hand is the only thing we really own

Well, you better not go at night.
There's things out there in the middle of them woods
That make a strong man die from fright.
Things that crawl and things that fly
And things that creep around on the ground.
And they say the ghost of Lucius Clay gets up and he walks around.
But I couldn't believe it.
I just had to find out for myself.
And I couldn't conceive it
'Cause I never would have listened to nobody else.
And I couldn't believe it.
I just had to find out for myself
There's some things in this world you just
can't explain.
The old man lived in the Wooley Swamp way back in Booger Woods.
He never did do a lot of harm in the world, but he never did do no good
 People didn't think too much of him. They all thought he acted funny
The old man didn't care about people anyway, all he cared about was his money.
He'd stuff it all down in mason jars, and he'd bury it all around
And on certain nights, if the moon was right, he'd dig it up out of the ground.
He'd pour it all out on the floor of his shack, and run his fingers through it.
Yeah, Lucius Clay was a greedy old man, and that's all that there was to it.
But I couldn't believe it.
I just had to find out for myself.
And I couldn't conceive it
'Cause I never would have listened to nobody else.
And I couldn't believe it.
I just had to find out for myself
There's some things in this world you just
can't explain.
The Caleb boys was white trash, they lived over on Carver's Creek.
They were mean as a snake, and sneaky as a cat, and belligerent when they'd speak.
One night the oldest brother said, ""Y'all meet me at the Wooley Swamp later
We'll take old Lucius's money, and we'll feed him to the alligators.""
They found the old man out in the back with a shovel in his hand,
Thirteen rusty mason jars was just dug up out of the sand.
And they all went crazy and they beat the old man, and they picked him up off of the ground.
Threw him in the swamp and stood there and laughed as the black water sucked him down.
Then they turned around, and went back to the shack, and picked up the money and ran.
They hadn't gone nowhere when they realized they were running in quicksand.
And they struggled and they screamed but they couldn't get away and just before they went under.
They could hear that old man laughing in a voice as loud as thunder.
And that's been fifty years ago and you can go by there yet.
There's a spot in the yard in the back of that shack where the ground is always wet.
And on summer nights if the moon is right down by the that dark footpath,
You can hear three young men screaming. You can hear one old man laugh.
Well, if you ever go back into Wooley Swamp,
Well, you better not go at night.
There's things out there in the middle of them woods
That make a strong man die from fright.
Things that crawl and things that fly
And things that creep around on the ground.
And they say the ghost of Lucius Clay gets up and he walks around.
But I couldn't believe it.

I've got to hand it to you girl,  you're
something else
But on the other hand, There's a golden band
To remind of someone who would not
understand
On one hand I could stay and be your loving man
But the reason I must go is on the other hand

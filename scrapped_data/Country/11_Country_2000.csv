0,Sinners Like Me (ver 4),Eric Church,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/eric-church/sinners-like-me-chords-1065036,"Capo 6th Fret
I was fifteen, when my daddy's old man
Caught me half way through my first beer
He laughed so hard, when my face turned green
He said you come from a long line of sinners like me
Now me and my brother go to see him sometimes
But he don't have much to say anymore
So we sit on his headstone with a fifth of Jack D
Here's to a long line of sinners like me
La de da de da  la de da da de
I come from a long line of sinners like me
My mama had a soft spot for a hell raisin' boy
So she had two more just like him 
It takes an angel to raise a family
That comes from a long line of sinners like me
Well now maybe who knows one day I'll settle down
Give my dad a grandson of his own 
And when the doctor smacks him he'll probably take a swing 
Cause he'll come from a long line of sinners like me
La de da de da  la de da da de
I come from a long line of sinners like me 
On the day I die 
I know where I'm gonna go
Me and Jesus got that part worked out
I'll wait at the gates till his face I see 
Stand in a long line of sinners like me
I stand in a long line of sinners like me
La de da de da  la de da da de
I come from a long line of sinners like me
La de da de da  la de da da de
Here's to a long line of sinners like me
I come from a long line of sinners like me

  Everything's gonna be alright

And laugh at the devil as his train rolls by

Were you blessed? I guess
By never knowing which road you're choosing
To you the next best thing

Well time has a way of throwing it all in your face

Heartbreak, ya know, drives a big black car

And through the glass, the corn crows come like rain
They wont stay, they wont stay
For too long now
This could be all that we know
Of love and all.
Well you were a dancer, I was a rag
The song in my head, well was all that I had
Hope was a letter I never could send
Love was a country we couldnt defend.
And through the carnival we watch them go round and round
All we knew of home was just a sunset and some clowns
Well you were a magazine, I was a plane jane
Just walking the sidewalks all covered in rain
Love to just get into one of your stories
Just me and all of my plain jane glory

Said I'd give you the whole world somehow
I tried makin' good on that promise
Thought I'd be so much further by now
Never could build you a castle
Even though you're the queen of my heart
But I've had the best of intentions from the start
Now some people think I'm a loser
'Cause I seldom get things right
But you make me feel like a winner
When you wrap me in your arms so tight
Please tell me you will remember
No matter how much I do wrong
That I had the best of intentions all along
I gave you a ring and I promised you things I always thought we'd do
But my best laid plans slipped right through my hands
To show my love for you
And if you could read my heart
Then you'd know without exception
It was all with the best of intentions
I gave you a ring and I promised you things I always thought we'd do
But my best laid plans slipped right through my hands
To show my love for you
And if you could read my heart

So here I am asking forgiveness
And praying that you'll understand
Don't think I take you for granted

You won't find devotion more true

And hes got your smile
I've been lookin back on the life we had
And im still by your side
Don't fear it now
We're going all the way
The sun is shining
On a brand new day
Its a long way down
And it's a leap of faith
But I'm never giving up
Cuz I know we've got a once
In a lifetime love

2.  He's a little shy, so she gave him a smile,
    and talking to me, I'm feeling a little low.""
    She said, ""I'm off in an hour, and I know where we can go.""
3.  So they went down and they sat on the pier,
    I got no one to send a letter to.
    Would you mind, if I sent one back here to you?""
    I...... cried, never gonna hold the hand of another guy,
    too young for him they told her,
    waiting for the love of the travelin' soldier.
    Our love will never end,
    waiting for the soldier to come back again,
    never more to be alone when the letter says,
    my soldier's coming home.
4.  So the letters came from an army camp
    and he told her of his heart and it might be love,
    and all of the things he was so scared of.
5.  He said, when it's getting kinda rough over here,
    And I close my eyes and see your pretty smile.
    Don't worry, but I won't be able to write for a while.

6.  One Friday night at a football game,
    a man said Folks would you bow your head
    for the list of local Vietnam dead.
7.  Crying all alone under the stands
    and one name read and nobody really cared,
    but a pretty little girl      with a bow in her hair.

  Yeah he plays just what he feels
  Keeps a letter in the pocket of his coat
  But he never breaks the seal
  Set up in a bar room corner
  Playing for tips and beer
  People carrying on and drinking
  And you gotta strain to hear
  I've seen him playing some old cheap guitar
  But he could play on pots and pans
  You never heard a soul so pure and true
  It's flowing right out of his hands
  And he can sing sweet as a choir girl
  Or he can sing a house on fire
  I've seen him calling up the angels
  And use a breeze for a telephone wire
  But if you ask him
  How he sings his blues so well
He says
I got a soul that I won't sell
I got a soul that I won't sell
I got a soul that I won't sell
And I don't read postcards from hell
  Said he came from down in Texas
  Playin' out since he's fifteen
  You can hear a little Chicago
  And a lot of New Orleans
  And he can take you on a freight train
  He can take you down the alley
  He can take you to the church
  He can walk you through the valley
  And if you ask him
  How he sings his blues so well
He says
I got a soul that I won't sell
I got a soul that I won't sell
I got a soul that I won't sell
And I don't read postcards from hell
  I've seen him sleeping in a doorway
  Maybe living outside
  On his back just like a cockroach
  But he ain't waiting to die
  And if you ask him
  How he sings his blues so well
He says
I got a soul that I won't sell
I got a soul that I won't sell
I got a soul that I won't sell
I got a soul that I won't sell
That's how I sing my blues so well

And while these words will sound so sweet.
I could care less about you, care less about you,
and I love the sound of you walking away.
and I can, see clearer, and I'm getting closer
to finding out just who I am without you in the way.            
So hold me...... but only..... for today.
Despite my best ambition, I get into the worse situations
but here I am, a crystal clean,
and on the nights so lonely, the words I say to you are phony, 
because there's nothing left to say.
and though you say you can't live without me
and every single night you think about me.
I could care less about you, care less about you,

So many thoughts to sit and ponder
About life and love and the lack of
And this emptiness in my heart
Too old to be wild and free
Still too young to be over the hill
Should try to grow up but who knows where to start.
So I'll just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the  warm air melt these blues away.
Sun comes up and the sun sinks down
And I've seen them both in this tourist town
Up for days in a rage
Just tryin' to search my soul
For all the answers, and the reasons why
I'm at these crossroads in my life
And I really don't know which way to go.
So I'll just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the  warm air melt these blues away.
Maybe I'll settle down
Get married or stay single and stay free
Which road I travel is still a mystery to me.
So I'll just sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Do my best to waste another day
Sit right here and have another beer in Mexico
Let the  warm air melt these blues away.

Riding on a midnight bus bound for Mexico
One was headed for vacation, one for higher education
And two of them were searchin' for a lost soul
Well that driver never ever saw the stop sign
Three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, heaven only knows
It's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go
Well that farmer left a harvest, a home and eighty acres
A faith and love for growin' things in his young son's heart
And that teacher left her wisdom in the mind's of lots of children
Did her best to give them all a better start
And that preacher whispered, ""can't you see the promised land?""
As he lay his bloodstained bible in that hooker's hand
Three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, heaven only knows
It's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go
Well that's the story that our preacher told last sunday
As he held that bloodstained bible up for all of us to see
He said, ""bless the farmer and the teacher and the preacher""
Three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway

And her blue tick hound dog Gideon,
Sittin on the front porch cooling in the shade
Singin every song the radio played
Waitin for the Alabama sun to go down
Two red dirt girls in a red dirt town
Me and Lillian
Just across the line and a little southeast of Meridian. 
She loved her brother I remember back when 
He was fixin up a '49 Indian
He told her ""Little sister, gonna ride the wind
Up around the moon and back again"".
He never got farther than Vietnam,
I was standin' there with her when the telegram come
For Lillian.
Now he's lyin' somewhere about a million miles from Meridian.
She said there's not much hope for a red dirt girl 
Somewhere out there is a great big world
That's where I'm bound
And the stars might fall on Alabama
But one of these days I'm gonna swing 
My hammer down
Away from this red dirt town
I'm gonna make a joyful sound
She grew up tall and she grew up thin
Buried that old dog Gideon
By a crepe myrtle bush at the back of the yard,
Her daddy turned mean and her mama leaned hard
   Got in trouble with a boy from town
Figured that she might as well settle down
So she dug right in
Across a red dirt line just a little southeast of Meridian
She tried hard to love him but it never did take
It was just another way for the heart to break
So she learned to bend. 
But one thing they don't tell you about the blues when you got'em
You keep on falling cause there ain't no bottom
There ain't no end. 
At least not for Lillian
Nobody knows when she started her skid,
She was only twenty seven and she had five kids.
Could'a been the whiskey, could'a been the pills, 
Could'a been the dream she was trying to kill.
But there won't be a mention in the news of the world 
About the life and the death of a red dirt girl
Named Lillian
Who never got any further across the line than Meridian.
Now the stars still fall on Alabama
Tonight she finally laid 
That hammer down
Without a sound
In the red dirt ground

I dream a highway back to you.
John he's kicking out the footlights
The Grand Ole Opry's got a brand new band
Lord, let me die with a hammer in my hand
I dream a highway back to you.
I think I'll move down into Memphis
And thank the hatchet man who forked my tongue
I lie and wait until the wagons come
And dream a highway back to you.
The getaway kicking up cinders
An empty wagon full of rattling bones
Moon in the mirror on a three-hour jones
I dream a highway back to you.
Oh, I dream a highway back to you love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision come arrest my soul
I dream a highway back to you.
Which lover are you, Jack of Diamonds?
Now you be Emmylou and I'll be Gram
I send a letter, don't know who I am
I dream a highway back to you.
I'm an indisguisable shade of twilight
Any second now I'm gonna turn myself on
In the blue display of the cool cathode ray
I dream a highway back to you.
I wish you knew me, Jack of Diamonds
Fire-riding, wheeling when I lead 'em up
Drank whisky with my water, sugar with my tea
My sails in rags with the staggers and the jags
I dream a highway back to you.
Oh, I dream a highway back to you love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision come molest my soul
I dream a highway back to you.
Now give me some of what you're having
I'll take you as a viper into my head
A knife into my bed, arsenic when I'm fed
I dream a highway back to you.
Hang overhead from all directions
Radiation from the porcelain light
Blind and blistered by the morning white
I dream a highway back to you.
Sunday morning at the diner
Hollywood trembles on the verge of tears
I watched the waitress for a thousand years
Saw a wheel inside a wheel, heard a call within a call
And I dreamed a highway back to you.
Oh, I dream a highway back to you love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision come possess my soul
I dream a highway back to you.
Step into the light, poor Lazarus
Don't lie alone behind the window shade
Let me see the mark death made
I dream a highway back to you.
I dream a highway back to you.
What will sustain us through the winter?
Where did last year's lessons go?
Walk me out into the rain and snow
I dream a highway back to you.
Oh, I dream a highway back to you love
A winding ribbon with a band of gold
A silver vision come and bless my soul
I dream a highway back to you.
I dream a highway back to you.
Oh I dream a highway back to you love.

A silver vision come and bless my soul

Lying 'bout their lives while they played

Gonna make it work somehow

And youre forever driving on the wrong side of the road
Wearing dungarees that youre mother stole

She wanted my money so I give her my soul

Long as everybody stay away
Rich is rich and poor is poor
And the money you had ain't good no more
Wait in a line, wait in a line

Everything you planted has gone to rot
And no one around to buy the little you got

Pouring gasoline on the killing field
March them soldiers down that line
March them boys in straight time
Them poor boys are like fuel on the fire
Bad news comin' down the AP Wire
Taciturn, do your fingers burn
What if anything did you earn
Ain't a taste that can satisfy
The blood lust of the youth gone wild
Everything you planted has gone to rot
And no one around to buy the little you got

Pouring gasoline on the killing field
Go somewhere to start a new town
Where no one has to hear that terrible sound

And no one around to buy the little you got

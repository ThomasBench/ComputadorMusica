Life can really suck sometimes
But hey, can't live in a shadow
So here's a little piece of advice
Start by kicking off your shoes
Leave 'em right by the door
Then you call a couple friends
And you call a few more
Put a drink into your glass
That will make you let go
Then you find something smooth on the radio
That makes you wanna sway to the left
And sway to the right,
Get lost in a groove that will make your lose you mind
Put a smile on your face, send you right into a daze
No there ain't nothing wrong when a song comes on that makes you wanna
Sway, eh eh ay, eh eh ay, oh oh oh
Hey, world's kinda messed up
We got no time for sitting around
Wait for it to let up
Let's break some rules and figure it out
Start by kicking off your shoes
Leave 'em right by the door
Then you call a couple friends
And you call a few more
Put a drink into your glass
That will make you let go
Then you find something smooth on the radio
That makes you wanna sway to the left
And sway to the right,
Get lost in a groove that will make your lose you mind

Start by kicking off your shooooooooes
And you find something smooooooooth
Something that makes you wanna sway to the left
And sway to the right,
Get lost in a groove that will make your lose you mind
Put a smile on your face, send you right into a daze

1,Wreck You,Lori McKenna,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lori-mckenna/wreck-you-chords-1917099,"Well, I get dressed in the dark each day
You used to think that was so sweet
By 6AM I'm in the car driving
I keep my change in the car ashtray
I haven't smoked in years and years
But lately I've been craving
I don't know how to pull you back
I don't know how to pull you close
All I know is how to wreck you
Something between us changed
I'm not sure if it's you or me
But lately, all I do seems to wreck you
Every now and then after work
I don't go straight home
I might sit out by the lake and wonder
I can almost see the face
of a little blue eyed girl
And the boy who thought he knew everything about her
I don't know how to pull you back
I don't know how to pull you close
All I know is how to wreck you
Something between us changed
I'm not sure if it's you or me
But lately, all I do seems to wreck you
Well, I don't know what the hell you want from me
Is there something or someone I should be?
One of these nights should I keep on driving
I don't know how to pull you back
I don't know how to pull you close
All I know is how to wreck you
Something between us changed
I'm not sure if it's you or me
But lately, all I do seems to wreck you

4,Bushwick Blues,Delta Spirit,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/delta-spirit/bushwick-blues-chords-896770,"Hold on to my hand, never let go, never let go
We were just two kids acting tough, Then we grew up, me, not so much
All the other guys that you've seen, are nothing compared to me
Because my love is strong and my heart is weak after all
When we first met we spoke so brief, When you sang a sonnet I hummed sweet relief
Do you recall the night we took the L out in the Bushwick it was colder than hell
So maybe there we should have stopped cause I’m out here feeling like a cop
Because my love is strong and my heart is weak after all
To the other side of the states return I met a young girl well, I couldn’t manage her
Because I think of you in every girl I meet, it's no relief that sounds to me just as sweet
So maybe I’m a fool for feeling used but the way we kissed that night I thought you knew
Because my love is strong and my heart is weak after all

Thought I’d been touched
Thought I’d been kissed
Thought I’d been loved

Thought I’d been kissed

Sailed that slow boat down to China, right up to the moon

Time just lies

I could have dug out the Grand Canyon with a spoon

An old crow, spoke to me,
Busted leg, limp down the street
Said we're both tied, to our own trees
Cut me loose, cut me loose
Saw the deer before it saw me
It didn't change anything
Glassy eyes showed me whats to come
Cut me loose, spare me from this
Little beast, are you wild as me
Left some teeth in your enemies
We won't be broken
There's no curse we haven't spoken
There is no oath, there is no spell
To deliver us, to make us well
Old woman, tell me why did you lie
So long in your hospital bed
With the spark gone from your eyes
We both know, theres nowhere to go
It's cast off, you and I
Old grief, are you wild as me
Left some teeth buried in your enemies
We won't be broken
Theres no curse we haven't spoken
There is no oath, there is no spell
To deliver us, so hell
Cut me loose, I wish you well
No oath, no spell
No prayer, and no hell but the one you make
It's cast off and turned tail

wearing black and blue and red
wouldn't it....seem fitting

  There was a time when I called you,

This old house.....is cold and empty
even these old walls have bent.
I laid down.... you're not with me.
Waking up just sinks it in.
  There was a time when I called you,
  There was a time when I called you mine.

No silver in this world left to find.
Precious metal......and precious memories

You make me want to hold on tight

And when I'm holdin' you, it feels like I've got the world in my hands

Because of you I'm a lucky man
You're the best part of who I am

And you're reaching for the phone
Change your mind

Even when you when you think it's wrong
When you look back in regret
The moment that you left
Change your mind

And I'm the only one you want tonight

When my kiss is all you crave
Let it go

The push and pull, the second chance

You'll just promise me forever
And then you'll take it back just like that

Dusk will come with fireflies

And every star will take its place
And silvery gown and purple shawl
You'll lie down in our big bed
Dread the dark and dread the dawn
But you'll be alright on that first night when I'm gone
You will reach for me in vain
You'll be whispering my name
As if sorrow were your friend
And this world so alien
But life will call with daffodils
And morning glorious blue skies
You'll think of me some memory
And softly smile to your surprise
And even though you love me still
You will know where you belong
Just give it time we'll both be fine when I'm gone

With flocks and swarms
They burst through the branches
They tumble and fall
Little gods surveying their worlds
Examining it all
You carry me home
My love
Still you carry me home
Little dove
A change in the winds
Smoke on the breeze
The sky is filled
With the scent of burning leaves
The vapors rise
From the glen in the east
Where the path is clear for you and me
You'll ride towards the sun
As it guides you home
But don't be afraid, little bird
You aren't alone
A hoard of friends
Will keep darkness at bay
You're the needle
In the hay
I'll take you with a steady hand
Make the seam reborn
The rip will be sewn up again
By the same hand that had it torn
Hear it approaching
The shuffle of feet
The clamor of metal
And hounds in heat
We'll steal away
To the glen in the east
Where the path is clear
For you and me

A little tan-legged Georgia dream
She's a rockin' them holey jeans
Baby what you got goin' on Saturday?
You know word's got it there's gonna be a party
Out of town about half a mile
Four wheel drives and big mud tires
Muscatine wine
Oh baby you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sittin' round watchin' all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And I'll find peace
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink
I'm chillin' to some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It's my kinda party
If you wanna drink,
Go baby just do your thing
Give up your keys
Hell, why drive when you can stay with me?
And then after a while we'll sneak away from the bonfire
Walk by the moonlight and down to the riverside
Gotcha sippin' on some moonshine
Baby if you're in the mood you can settle for a one night rodeo,
You can be my tan-legged Juliet,
I'll be your Redneck Romeo
Oh baby you can find me

I was destined to stay in this city
New Orleans in the morning after Mardi Gras
Is like the sweetest hangover you ever saw
All the buildings sag, beads hang from the trees
In the pink sky dawn I stumbled to Lafitte’s
In the corner of the bar with a notepad and a pen
A little hair of the dog, I wrote Mr. Tambourine Man
When the apocalypse is over, I hope you like your job
Ain’t it a shame nobody sets anybody free anymore
I hate a song where the singer is mad at their ex
Cause they said they’d always love ‘em now they’ve gone up and left
And they complain and they whine, and they want ‘em to come back home
I say, out of seven billion people, let the ones who don’t love you go
When the apocalypse is over, I hope you like your job
Ain’t it a shame nobody sets anybody free anymore
Never trust a musician who plays with their eyes open
All the good shit happens when they’re closed
You gotta give yourself the shivers before you can give ‘em to someone else
So I wrote Mr. Tambourine Man and I left it in the dust
The perfect song is the song that you only got to play once
I don’t wanna be no dinosaur blaming the asteroid for my strife
I might’ve been born yesterday, but I’ve been up all night       wooaah
When the apocalypse is over, I hope you like your job

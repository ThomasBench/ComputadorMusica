I’ve got a little darkness in my heart
I know one day the world will fall apart
But until it falls to pieces and there’s fire in the sky
I’m gonna take my heart and let it shine, shine, shine
I’m gonna take my heart and let it shine
I’ve got a little darkness in my soul
No Jesus, pills, or whisky fills the hole
I’ll light another fire so the world will burn all night
I’m gonna take my heart and let it shine, shine, shine
I’m gonna take my heart and let it shine
I want to shine like the moon at night
I’ll be a million candles
That guide your weary footsteps
And keep you safe from harm
And if my light should falter
You’ll bury me in the ground
And guide me through the darkness
Till death it comes around
There’s a darkness on the broken side of town
At midnight when the devils come around
I’ll light us both a fire and I’ll take you through the night
I’m gonna take my heart and let it shine, shine, shine
I’m gonna take my heart and let it shine
I want to shine like the moon at night
I’ll be a million candles
That guide your weary footsteps
And keep you safe from harm
And if my light should falter
You’ll bury me in the ground
And guide me through the darkness
Till death it comes around

And if not, would it be okay if someone bought you a beer
Let's say that someone wanted to dance
Would he have any snowballin' hell of a chance
To get you out on the floor before this slow song ends
Yeah, I'm just asking for a friend
He ain't ever been any good at laying it all out on the line
I swear down deep, believe me girl, he's a really good guy
If you can find it in your heart just to cut him some slack
He'd be johnny-on-the-spot here in two seconds flat
Yeah, he's holding his breath, come on give him a second with you
Oh yeah
Yeah, what do you say
It's Friday night and you're beautiful, so beautiful
What man wouldn't make you the love of his life
He'd be a fool, he'd be a fool
Just one drink would sure mean a lot to him
Yeah, I'm just asking for a friend
Let's say this friend of mine went and messed up real bad
And he'd do anything in this world, girl, to get you back
Hey what kind of sorry would it take
For a man to erase his worst mistake
And would this even begin to make a dent
Oh yeah
Yeah what do you say
It's Friday night and you're beautiful, so beautiful
What man wouldn't make you the love of his life
He'd be a fool, he'd be a fool
I don't mean to ramble on like this

3,Little Again,The Secret Sisters,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-secret-sisters/little-again-chords-2273105,"Riding along in a little red wagon
Attached to the back of that dirty old rusty John Deere
We bump along through the dirt in the garden
Our knees all bruised up and feet just as hard as the rocks in the creek
Bed we walk on for hours on end
It's one of those days where I want to be little again
We wandered down every trail on that hillside
Learned every lesson by the light of the fireflies
Creek's kinda cold, don't tip-toe, you gotta jump in
When I get lonely I dream of the valley
Kid shifting gears in a '63 Chevy
Muscadine vines and the maple trees catching the wind
It's one of those days where I want to be little again
It's one of those days when you wake up in some broken city
With nothing but home on your mind
And all of these days when they add up, they amount to nothing
Like all the ones you've left behind
Now we're all grown and always of parted
It still has my heart resting between those two hills
I travel the world and see lots of places
Sing lots of songs to all kinds of faces
But that don't compare to adventures I had way back when
It's one of those days where I want to be little again
It's one of those days when you wake up in some broken city
With nothing but home on your mind
And all of these days when they add up, they amount to nothing
Like all the ones you've left behind

distant cars alarms sonud like birds.

You're screaming underneath my window
and my roommate's blacked out on the toilet again
and I'm checking into the emergency room
under a fake name at 4 a.m. So..

And I don't wanna die in Greenpoint.
Where the sewage treatment plant smells suspiciously like Chinese
food and man i don't even want to think about what that means.
And we're straining our eyes looking for those big city lights
but it's not even Jersey it's Queens ah.
and if that's my mother calling on the phone,
dude, I am totally not home.
I'm exercising my right to surrender to the poison of my choice.
I'm the master of my own worst case scenario.

You'll be in your bed by nine every night,
Take your hand-spanked, corn-fed gal,
And your best friend's four-eyed pal,
To a treat right down the street that's dynamite,
Now let your conscience be your guide,
If you put your foot inside,
You wish you left your well-enough alone,
When you got hell to pay, put the truth on layaway,
And blame it on that ole' crazy bone.

And blame it on the ole' crazy bone.
Don't be stuck up in Alaska, when you should be in Nebraska,
On a Thursday when it's Egg & Daughter Nite,
When the farmers come to town,
And they spread them eggs around,
And they drop their daughters down at the roller rink,
Well you're probably standing there
With your slicked-back, brylcreem hair,
Your Lucky's and your daddy's fine-tooth comb,
If they knew what you were thinking.
They'd run you out of Lincoln,
Just blame it on that ole' crazy bone,

Well you must have left your wisdom tooth at home,
If they knew what you were thinking,
They'd run you out of Lincoln,

When the grandkids all are grown,
And they put you in a home,
And eternity is approaching fast,
Yeah you're half out of your head,
And you probably pissed the bed,
And you can't see a thing to save your ass,
And far across the prairie (prairie),
In the local cemetery ('tery),
They already got your name carved out in stone,
When all them nurses say, ""Grandpa why you walk that way?""
Just blame it on that ole' crazy bone,
Yeah blame it on that ole' crazy...

To these doubts we drag around
And babe I never learned
You'll say the word and then I'll break

So we're covered up in fiction
Chasing something true

And damn the consequences too

Hates himself and loves the crowd

Folks at the tavern, all dance and smile
Blend with the pattern, live in the lie
Dressed up like people, who've walked lonely miles
I can see through you, cause I've done the time
My body's a prison, my mind is a cell
And you can't get away from yourself
You can't get away from yourself
Nothing is sacred, nothing is clean
Everyone's broken, know what I mean
Violence is purer, than the sky or the ground
When this war is over, hope this city drowns
My body's a prison, my mind is a cell
And you can't get away from yourself
You can't get away from yourself

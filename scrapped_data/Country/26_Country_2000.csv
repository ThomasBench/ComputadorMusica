0,Doin My Thing,Luke Bryan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/luke-bryan/doin-my-thing-chords-2758410,"I'm walkin' down the street, shufflin' my feet
Whistlin' a feel good song
Got the sun on my face, nothin' in my way
So I keep rockin' along
I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Just floatin' on a breeze
I'm just  doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Don't worry 'bout me    (hey!)
The people downtown are hustlin' around
The weight of the world on their mind
Me, I'm sittin' in the shade soakin' up the day
Watchin' them all roll by
I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Just floatin' on a breeze
I'm just  doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Don't worry 'bout me
I like it laid back like a baby blue Cadillac
Easin' on down the road
I like it nice and slow layin' low
 Rollin' any where that the  wind may  blow
I'm just doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Just floatin' on a breeze
I'm just  doin' my thing, just doin' my thing
Don't worry 'bout me
Don't you worry
I'm just doing my thing...

1,Do I (ver 4),Luke Bryan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/luke-bryan/do-i-chords-962162,"Baby what are we becoming?
It feels just like we're always running.
Rolling through the motions everyday.
I can lean in to hold you.
Or act like I don't even know you.
Seems like you could care less either way.
What happened to that girl I used to know?
I just want us back to the way we were before.
Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love, am I still enough?
Tell me don't I or tell me do I baby.
Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Baby, do I?
Remember when we didn't have nothing?
But a perfect simple kind of loving.
Baby those sure were the days.
There was a time our love ran wild and free.
Now I'm second guessing everything thing I see.
Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love, am I'm still enough?
Tell me don't I or tell me do I baby.
Give you everything that you ever wanted?
Would you rather just turn away and leave me lonely?
Do I just need to give up and get on with my life?
Baby, do I?
Still give you what you need?
Still take your breath away?
Light up the spark way down deep, baby do I?
Do I turn you on at all when I kiss you baby?
Does the sight of me wanting you drive you crazy?
Do I have your love, am I'm still enough?
Tell me don't I or tell me do I baby?

You were sitting in the passenger side
Messin’ with the radio, you had your sun glasses on.
I pulled over cause I couldn’t believe
Two weeks ago that was you and me
Riding down these old back roads, singing our songs
Now everybody round our town's been whisperin’
A tear in your eye says I should have been listenin’
Baby is someone else calling you baby
It’s driving me crazy
This bein in the dark
Goodbye ain't never easy
So break it to me hard
If you’re over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
You wanted time and you wanted your space
So I backed off, did whatever it takes
Never really thought you were that ready for moving along
Now I ain’t leaving till I hear you say what’s going on
It’ll be what it will be, its either him or me
Give me the word and girl I’m gone
Baby is someone else calling you baby
It’s driving me crazy
This bein in the dark
Goodbye ain't never easy
So break it to me hard
If you’re over my love girl
Lay it on my heart
Don’t try to save me
Is someone else calling you baby?
No Goodbye ain't never easy

Heed the curves and watch the tunnels
Never falter, never fail

And your eye upon the rail

Where the angels wait to join us
In that train forevermore

7,Im My Own Grandpa,Willie Nelson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/willie-nelson/im-my-own-grandpa-chords-911455,"Now many, many years ago, when I was twenty-three,
I was married to a widow who was pretty as could be.
This widow had a grown-up daughter who had hair of red,
my father fell in love with her, and soon the two were wed.
This made my dad my son-in-law and changed my very life,
my daughter was my mother, cause she was my father's wife.
To complicate the matter, even though it brought me joy,
I soon became the father of a bouncing baby boy.
My little baby then became a brother-in-law to Dad,
and so became my uncle, though it made me very sad.
For if he was my uncle, that also made him brother
of the widow's grown-up daughter, who, of course, was my stepmother.
I'm my own grandpa, I'm my own grandpa!
It sounds funny, I know, but it really is so,
oh, I'm my own grandpa!
My father's wife then had a son who kept him on the run,
and he became my grandchild, for he was my daughter's son.
My wife is now my mother's mother, and it makes me blue,
because she is my wife, she's my grandmother, too.
I'm my own grandpa, I'm my own grandpa!
It sounds funny, I know, but it really is so,
oh, I'm my own grandpa!
Now if my wife is my grandmother, then I'm her grandchild,
and every time I think of it, it nearly drives me wild.
For now, I have become the strangest case you ever saw,
as the husband of my grandmother, I am my own grandpa!
I'm my own grandpa, I'm my own grandpa!
It sounds funny, I know, but it really is so,
oh, I'm my own grandpa!
I'm my own grandpa, I'm my own grandpa!
It sounds funny, I know, but it really is so,
oh, I'm my own grandpa!

Well the moon just came over the tree tops
And the whippoorwill started to sing
So I slid down the hill
Got into the still
And drank till my ears started to ring
I followed a trail to through the hollow
To a shack back in the woods
It’s my eighteenth birthday
Honey come out and play
Its time that we got to no good
Now I ain’t afraid to be lonely
But I still wanna learn about love
I’m a hillbilly child raised in the wild
Come lay down on my bare skin rug
My dress is torn up and tattered
My daddy left a long time ago
And my hair just hangs down
I never made it to town
Momma said that’s where bad people go
But me and my sister been talkin'
She’s eighteen one year older than me
She laid down with a man
I want to understand what she says
I'll never believe 
Now I ain’t afraid to be lonely
But I still wanna learn about love
I’m a hillbilly child raised in the wild
Lay me down on your bare skin rug
Now I need a woman
And I need a man
We ain’t got nobody
An' we ain’t even kin
Now I ain’t afraid to be lonely
But I still wanna learn about love
I’m a hillbilly child raised in the wild
Lay me down on your bare skin rug

To chase a future paved with gold
Small county road donat ever reach
But for every cloudless mile the sun has shone
Thereas been a hundred nights alone at least
The shame is how it took so long
to figure out fair to midland donat come cheap
My eyes keep lonely thought reminding me
With every dusty truck that I see
Iam only closer to how far away can be
And all the time its left is an eternity
Now to make myself west Texas bound

I've drawn all the curtains in this old house 
To keep the sun out and off my face
My friends stop by to check in cause I've checked out
I tell em I'm fine 
   I'm just living for the night
Daylight can't hide the tears I've cried 
The pain that came with your goodbye 
The memories that keep me out of sight
Every night I venture out 
Into those neon arms that hold me tight
   I'm living for the night
I'm a whole lot easier to talk to 
When I've had a few I settle down 
The whiskey kills the man you've turned me in to 
I come alive

The pain that came with your goodbye

Never spoke of His name, never read her His Word.
Two nonbelievers walking lost in this world.
Took there baby with them, what a sad little girl.
Her daddy drank all day and mommy did drugs
Never wanted to play or give kisses and hugs
She'd watch the TV and sit there on that couch, 
While her mom fell asleep and her daddy went out.
And the drinking, and the fighting,
Just got worse every night
Behind their couch, she'd be hiding,
Oh what a sad little life
And like it always does, the bad just got worse,
With every slap, and every curse
Until her daddy in a drunk rage one night, 
Used a gun on her mom, and then took his life.
Then some people, from the city,
Took the girl far away 
To a new mom, and a new dad
Kisses and hugs every day.
Her first day of Sunday school, the teacher walked in,
And a small little girl, staring at a picture of him.
She said I know that man, up there on that cross, 
Oh, I don't know his name, but I know he got off.
Cause he was there in my old house,
And held me close to his side.
As I hid there behind our couch.
The night that my parents died.

42,Devil In The Bottle,Hank Williams Jr.,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/hank-williams-jr-/devil-in-the-bottle-chords-1951037,"I come home late at night with my boots in my hands
Stumble in the backdoor bein' quiet as I can
And I know she's there in bed cold and all alone
And she's cryin' because I'm breaking up our home
And she knows the hell that I'm goin' through 
In this world inside my head
There's a devil in the bottle Lord 
And he wants to see me dead
I fall into her arms and she helps me with my clothes
Guess she stays on with me cause she really knows
That I'm tryin' Lord to find my freedom
By escaping to the only freedom I've ever known
And she knows this hell that I'm goin' through 
In this world inside my head
There's a devil in the bottle Lord 
And he won't rest till I'm dead
There's a devil in the bottle Lord 
And he wants to see me dead

Just to get my solitude
I need some juju
And I don't know what to do

When all I need's a drop of rain
I got my cuts and bruises
Now I'd like to feel the pain

But I just can't do it well

We were growin our hair
We were cuttin class 
Knew it all already there was nothin to learn 
We were strikin matches just to watch em burn 
Listen to our music just a little too loud 
We were hangin in there with the outcast crowd 
Headin to the rapids with some discount beer 
It was a long train tussle but we had no fear
Man I don't know
Where the time goes 
But it sure goes fast
Wanna be rebels who didn't have a clue 
With our Rock n' roll T-shirts
And our typically bad attitudes 
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done 
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly
Young, young

But It sure goes fast
Just like that we were
Wanna be rebels who didn't have a clue 
With our Rock n roll T-shirts
And our typically bad attitudes 
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done 
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly
Young , young, young
Yeah Wishin we were older

Thoughts of you run wild.
I'm longin' for your touch,
Haunted by your smile.
No use in tryin' to erase.
No one could ever take your place.
Well I remember how it used to feel
Back when our love was strong and real
And I remember tears in your eyes
All I want right now is to forget
Every single thing that I regret
That drowned out these embers,
But I remember.
It's yesterday again
Here inside my mind.
I can't find a way
To leave your love behind.
I want to wake up to the day
Your memory won't stand in my way.

Without and umbrella
Coverin' my head
And called me names
But I was too afraid
That night he came to town
Momma said I couldn't
That time she dared me to
But I didn't
Oh I, I'd done a lot of things different
When he was alive
Now I don't have the chance
Before he went off to war
But I just shook his hand
When my grandma begged me to
But I was scared of God
Boy, you're gonna wish you hadn't
But I wouldn't
Oh I, I'd done a lot of things different
People say they wouldn't change a thing
Even if they could
Oh, but I would
There was this red dress she wanted one time
So bad she could taste it
I should've bought it, but I didn't
And trim it with blues and greens
I wouldn't let her, it wouldn't have hurt nothin'
And she loved to be kissed and held and touched
But I didn't do it, not nearly enough
I would've asked the band to play
On and on, on and on
Oh I, I'd done a lot of things different
People say they wouldn't change a thing
Even if they could
Oh, but I would
Oh I, I'd done a lot of things different
Oh I, I'd done a lot of things... I think we'd all do a lot things different

All I got is a picture she mailed me
Barefoot in the snow-white sand, bag of seashells in her hand
She finally found the paradise it seems
On the coast of somewhere beautiful, trade winds blowing through her hair
Sunlight dancing on the water, and I  wish I  was there
Don't know how I'm gonna find her, all I  know so far
She's on the coast of somewhere beautiful, running with my heart
Sometimes when the sun goes down, shadows fall across this little town
I  close my eyes and I  drift away
To another place and another time, when the world was ours and she was mine
I dream of holding her again someday
On the coast of somewhere beautiful, trade winds blowing through her hair
Sunlight dancing on the water, and I  wish I  was there
Don't know how I'm gonna find her, all I  know so far
She's on the coast of somewhere beautiful, running with my heart
Don't know how I'm gonna find her, all I  know so far
She's on the coast of somewhere beautiful, running with my heart

With talented breezes that blow off your hat with a sneer

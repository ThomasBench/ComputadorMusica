0,If This Is Goodbye,Mark Knopfler,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/mark-knopfler/if-this-is-goodbye-chords-1082328,"My famous last words
Are laying around in tatters
Sounding absurd
Whatever I try
But I love you
And that's all that really matters
If this is goodbye
If this is goodbye
Your bright shining sun
Would light up the way before me
You were the one
Made me feel I could fly
And I love you
Whatever is waiting for me
If this is goodbye
If this is goodbye
Who knows how long we've got
Or what we're made out of
Who knows if there's a plan or not
I know there is our love
My famous last words
Could never tell the story
Spinning unheard
In the dark of the sky
But I love you
And this is our glory
If this is goodbye
If this is goodbye
If this is goodbye
If this is goodbye

1,Lodi (ver 2),Jeffrey Foucault,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jeffrey-foucault/lodi-chords-2910410,"Just about a year ago  I set out on the road
Seekin' my fame and fortune  And looking for a pot of gold
Things got bad,  things got worse  I guess you know the tune
Oh lord, stuck in Lodi again
And I rode in on a grey hound  I'll be walking out if I go
I was just passing through  Must be seven months or more
Ran out of time and money  Looks like they took my friends
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again
The man from the magazine  Said I was on my way
Somewhere I lost connection,  ran out of songs to play
Came into town on a one night stand,  looks like my plans fell through
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again
If I only had a dollar,  for every song I sung
And everytime I had to play,  while people sat there drunk
You know I'd catch the next train,  back to where I live
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again
Oh Lord, stuck in Lodi again

with red plastic mouths

The casting of spells
The pressure devices

Is any song worth singing
if it doesn't help?

Don't forget that your body will let it all go
Fill up your mind with all it can know

Open your arms
as far as they will go
Take off your dress

was written when I was alone
In love with you
I shook down these lines
to shine up the streets
I got up off my hands and knees
to thank my lucky stars
that you're not me

Sometimes I smoke cigarettes
The Christian folk say I should quit it
I just smile and say, 'God bless'
Cause I heard Jesus, He drank wine
And I bet we'd get along just fine
He could calm a storm and heal the blind
And I bet He'd understand a heart like mine
Daddy cried when he saw my tattoo
Said he loved me anyway
My brother got the brains of the family
So I thought I'd learn to sing
Cause I heard Jesus, He drank wine
And I bet we'd get along just fine
He could calm a storm and heal the blind
And I bet He'd understand a heart like mine
Well, I'll fly, away  From it all  one day  And I'll fly  away,
But these are the days that I will remember
When my name's called on the roll
He'll meet me with two long-stemmed glasses
And make a toast to me coming home
Cause I heard Jesus, He drank wine

Where you would have been proud

Any of these questions
Don't have no god to teach me no lessons

Sit in my chair
One night they called me for supper
But I never got up
I stayed right there
In my chair
I wished I would have known you
Wished I would have shown you
All of the things
I was on the inside
I pretend to be sleeping
When you come in in the morning
To whisper goodbye
Go to work in the rain
I don't know why
Don't know why

We just want to be heard
Disappearing everyday

I bet this car will go real fast
The wheels might even drive me past
The places that you said I'd never go, oh
The Texas sky is the biggest one I've ever seen
But it still ain't big enough for you and me
All the things that make you mad
All the baggage in your past
Don't leave much room for a girl like me to be
So, I'll fill her up with hope and worn out dreams
And I'll grab the wheel and I'll point it west
Pack the good and leave the rest
I'll drive until I find the missing piece
You said I wouldn't get too far on a tank of gas
But I got everything I'll ever need
I got this old guitar and a brand new set of strings
Mama said, I never should've done it
I should have ended us before we ever started
Daddy knew about my pride
So he stood there and he smiled inside
And I pretended that I didn't notice
A little tear that fell when I said, I was going
And I'll grab the wheel and I'll point it west
Pack the good and leave the rest

And there's so much that I long to do to you

I tried makin' good on that promise
Thought I'd be so much further by now
Never could build you a castle
Even though you're the queen of my heart
But I've had the best of intentions from the start
Now some people think I'm a loser
'Cause I seldom get things right
But you make me feel like a winner
When you wrap me in your arms so tight
Please tell me you will remember
No matter how much I do wrong
That I had the best of intentions all along
I'd give you a ring and I promised you things I always thought we'd do
But my best laid plans slipped right through my hands
To show my love for you
And if you could read my heart
Then you'd know without exception
It was all with the best of intentions

I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don't go, and I said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me I was
Begging you please don't go, and I said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say yes
Romeo, save me, they try to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real,
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say yes, oh
I got tired of waiting,   wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said
Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
Marry me, Juliet you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress

Done anything to make you stay

And saw me running down the runway just like I was crazy

Trying to figure out which one you might be on
And why you don't love me anymore

But a million miles away, a million miles away
By now, I know, I'd act like you don't love me

Each look into your eyes and fall in
A little more and more
Looks like we started us a fire
Wrapped up in flames of desire
With every touch that burned higher
Two shadows dancing on the wall
With nothing on but the radio
Feel the music playin’ soft and slow
You and me and the lights down low
With nothing on but the radio

About the places that I'd like to see
I say ""Friend do you think I'll ever get there?""
Aw, but he just stands there smiling back at me
So I confess my sins to the preacher
About the love I've been praying to find
Is there a brown eyed boy in my future
And he says, ""Girl, you've got nothing but time""
But how do you wait for heaven
And who has that much time
And how do you keep your feet on   the ground
When you know that you were born,        you were born to fly
My daddy is grounded like the oak tree
My momma she is steady as the sun
Oh, you know I love my folks, but I keep staring down the road
Just looking for my one chance to run
Yeah, 'cause I will soar away like the blackbird
I will blow in the wind like a seed
I will plant my heart in the garden of my dreams
And I will grow up where I'll wander wild and free
But how do you wait for heaven
And who has that much time
And how do you keep your feet on   the ground

On a blanket lookin' up.
Half a moon peekin' down at us,
From underneath the clouds.
Teenage kids sneakin' out again,
I heard the thunder rollin' in.
We were fallin' the moment when, 
It all came pourin' down. 
The Georgia rain on the Jasper county clay,
Couldn't wash away what I felt for you that day.
Just you an' me down an ol' dirt road,
Nothin' in our way except for the Georgia rain.
The cotton fields remember when,
Flash of lightnin' drove us in.
We were soaked down to the skin,
By the time we climbed inside.
I don't remember what was poundin' more,
Heart in my chest or the hood of that Ford.
As the sky fell in an' the storm clouds poured,
Worlds away outside.
The Georgia rain on the Jasper county clay,
Couldn't wash away what I felt for you that day.
Just you an' me down an ol' dirt road,
No one saw a thing except for the Georgia rain.
Screen door flappin' in the wind,
Same ol' house I grew up in.
I can't believe I'm back again,
After all these years away.
You fixed your Daddy's house up nice,
I saw it yesterday when I drove by.
Looks like you've made yourself a real good life,
What else can I say?
The Georgia rain on the Jasper county clay,
Couldn't wash away the way I loved you to this day.
The old dirt road's paved over now,
Nothin' here's the same except for --
The Georgia rain on the Jasper county clay,
Couldn't wash away the way I loved you to this day.
Just you an' me down an ol' dirt road,
Nothin' in our way except for the Georgia rain.

Maybe she won't even care
At seven, she'll throw  a kiss towards the door
And smile at my empty chair
For there's nothing there for a man to cling to
Nothing to pull me back home...
Only a girl that's a stranger to me
Breathing on flames that are gone
Home isn't where I hang up my hat every night
And home isn't anything
Like cold arms holding me tight,   that's not right....
And home isn't some place to go
Just to feel all alone,    that's not home
Maybe she might never see me again
Maybe that's the best way....
I'll join myself to some south blowing wind
And leave her to find her own way...
And maybe I'll find home someday

0,Third Rate Romance,Sammy Kershaw,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/sammy-kershaw/third-rate-romance-chords-3922652,"Sittin at a tiny table in a ritzy restaurant  
She was staring at her coffee cup
He was trying to keep his courage up by applying booze
The talk was small when they talked at all
They both knew what they wanted         
There was no need to talk about it
They were old enough to scope it out and keep it loose
She said you don't look like my type but I guess you'll do
Third rate romance, low rent rendezvous
He said I'll even tell you that I love you if you want me to
Third rate romance, low rent rendezvous
When they left the bar they got in his car and they drove away
He drove to the family inn. She didn't even have to pretend she
Didn't know what for
Then he went to the desk and made his request while she waited outside
He came back with the key and she said give it to me and I'll           
Unlock the door
She kept saying I've never really done this kind of thing before        
Have you?
Third rate romance, low rent rendezvous
And he said yes I have but only a time or two
Third rate romance, low rent rendezvous
Third rate romance, low rent rendezvous
Third rate romance, low rent rendezvous

In this situation
I'm looking to you
For some inspiration

That a man doesn't know what he sees
I guess it's time to look
From a different point of view
So won't you, talk to me heart
And say what's on your mind
Come on and talk to me heart
Before I run out of time
I've got to know just how you feel
Before I decide if she's for real
Do I give her the part
You gotta talk to me heart
I can't always see the forest
For the trees
And if this one don't work out
I know you're gonna blame me
But it's high time I made a move
Tell me what she has to prove
Ah' come on heart
Before she gets away from me
So won't you, talk to me heart
And say what's on your mind
Come on and talk to me heart

Some have called me a storm about to rage.
But if you'll take me not forsake me,
I'll hand you my heart in a Golden Cage.
For I love you, with reckless abandon
And I have loved you like that from the start.    
It's my good fortune just to know you.
Your eyes put wildness in my heart.
Down from the Mountains I've come like thunder.
For I've lain to long where the cold rivers run.
Just to know you, just to flow with you,
Just to grow with you, and to reap and sew with you.
Just to hold you when your hair's undone.
Like a flash of lightning in the heavens
Some lights light up a darkened sky
Who hide their hearts and their love deny
But if you'll take me, not forsake me
If you'll help me just as I am.
I will love you beyond forever
And pledge to you my heart on sacred ground.
Down from the Mountains I've come like thunder.
I've lain to long where the cold rivers run.
Just to know you, just to flow with you,
Just to grow with you, and to reap and sew with you.
Just to hold you when your hairs undone.
Now out in the badlands, I am an outlay
But I stand on the words of Saint Paul.
Though we speak like angels and gain the whole world,
If we don't have love, we have nothing at all.
And If I displease you and you don't want me.
I still wish you love for love is blessed.
We can take nothing greater, upon our journey,
And rest assured, we need to take nothing less.
Down from the Mountains I've come like thunder.
I've lain to long where the cold rivers run.
Just to know you, just to flow with you,
Just to grow with you, and to reap and sew with you.
Just to hold you when your hairs undone.
Just to hold you when your hairs undone.

Living on love buyin on time
Without somebody nothing aint worth a dime
Just like a old fashion story book rhyme living on love
It sounds simple that's what youre thinking but love
can walk through fire without blinking
It dosen't take much when you get enough living on love
Two old people without a thing children gone but still they sing
Side by side in that front porch swing living on love
He cant see anymore she can barely sweep the floor
Hand in hand they walk through that door, living on love

would come to some bad end,
Well, the sheriff had caught him stealing chickens and such by the
time that he was ten.
And one day his daddy took a 10 dollar bill
and he tucked it in his hand,
He said I can tell you're headed for trouble son,
and your mama wouldn't understand.
So he took that money and his brother's old bay
and left without a word of thanks,
Fell in with a crowd in some border town
Took to robbin' banks.
Well, outside the law your luck'll run out fast,
a few years came and went;
'til he's trapped in an alley in Abilene
with all but four shells spent.
And he realized prayin' was the only thing
that he hadn't ever tried;
well, he wasn't sure he knew quite how
but he looked up to the sky.
Said ""You don't owe me nothin' and as far as I know, Lord
I don't owe nothin' to you
I ain't askin' for a miracle Lord
just a little bit of luck will do.
And you know I ain't never prayed before
but it always seemed to me
that prayin's the same as beggin' Lord
I don't take no charity.
Yeah, but right now Lord with my back to the wall
I can't help but recall
how they nearly hung me for stealin' a horse
in Ft. Smith, Arkansas
Judge Parker said guilty and the gavel came down
just like a cannon shot.
And I went away quietly
I began to file and plot.
Well, they sent the preacher down to my cell
he said, ""the Lord is your only hope,
he's the only friend that you're gonna have
when you hit the end of Parker's rope.""
Well, I guess he could've kept on preachin' 'til Christmas
but he turned his back on me.
I put a homemade blade to that golden throat
and asked the deputy for the key.
Yeah, it ain't the first close call I ever had
as I'm sure you already know
I had some help from you Lord and the Devil himself,
it's been strictly touch and go.
Yeah, but who in the hell am I talkin to?
There ain't no one here but me
And then he cocked both his pistols, and he spit in the dirt,
and he walked out in the street.

16,Love Me (ver 2),Collin Raye,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/collin-raye/love-me-chords-2334009,"I read a note my grandma wrote back in nineteen twenty-three.
Grandpa kept it in his coat, and he showed it once to me.     He said,
""Boy, you might not understand, but a long, long time ago,
Grandma's daddy didn't like me none, but I loved your Grandma so.""
We had this crazy plan to meet and run away together.
Get married in the first town we came to, and live forever.
But nailed to the tree where we were supposed to meet, instead
Of her, I found this letter, and this is what it said:
If you get there before I do, don't give up on me.
I'll meet you when my chores are through;
I don't know how long I'll be.
But I'm not gonna let you down, darling wait and see.
And between now and then, till I see you again,
I'll be loving you.  Love, me.
I read those words just hours before my Grandma passed away,
In the doorway of a church where me and Grandpa stopped to pray.
I know I'd never seen him cry in all my fifteen years;
But as he said these words to her, his eyes filled up with tears.
If you get there before I do, don't give up on me.
I'll meet you when my chores are through;
I don't know how long I'll be.
But I'm not gonna let you down, darling wait and see.
And between now and then, till I see you again,
I'll be loving you.  Love, me.
Between now and then, till I see you again,

It was where granddaddy taught me how to cuss and how to pray,
It was where we made our own ice cream those sultry summer nights,
Where the bulldog had her puppies, and us brothers had our fights,
There were many nights I'd sit right there and look out at the stars, 
To the sound of a distant whippoorwill, or the hum of a passin' car,
It was where I first got up  the nerve to steal me my first kiss, 
and it was where I learned to play guitar and pray I had the gift,
If the world had a front porch like we did back then,
We'd still have our problems, but we'd all be friends, 
Treatin' your neighbor like he's your next of kin
wouldn't be gone, with the wind,
if the world had a front porch 
like did back then
Purple hulls and pintos, I've shelled more than my share, 
lightning bugs and crickets, Danced in the evening air, 
and like a beacon that ole' yellow moon it always lead me home, 
some how mama always knew, just when to leave it on,
If the world had a front porch like we did back then,
We'd still have our problems, but we'd all be friends, 
Treatin' your neighbor like he's your next of kin
wouldn't be gone, with the wind,

Smile all the time
Shine your teeth 'til meaningless
Sharpen them with lies
And whatever is going down
Will follow you around
That's how you fight loneliness
You laugh at every joke
Drag your blanket blindly
Fill your heart with smoke
And the first thing that you want
Will be the last thing you ever need
That's how you fight it
Just smile all the time

on a cold winter day,
took a shortcut through the woods
and I lost my way,
It was getting late
and I was scared and Along,
but then a kind old man
took my hand and lead me home
Now momma couldn’t see him, 
oh but he was standing there,
and I knew in my heart
he was the answers to my prayers
Oh, I believe there are angels among us,
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.
They come to you, and me
in our darkest hours,
to show us how to live,
to teach us how to give.
To guide us with the light of love.
When life held trouble times
and had me down on my knees
there has always been someone
to come along and comfort me
a kind word from a stranger
to lend a helping hand
a phonecall from a friend
just to say I understand
But ain’t it kinda funny
at the dark end of the road
that someone lights a way
with just a single ray of hope
Oh, I believe there are angels among us,
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.
They come to you, and me
in our darkest hours,
to show us how to live,
to teach us how to give.
To guide us with the light of love.
There were so many faces
that show up in the strangest places
that grace us with their mercy
in our time of need
Oh, I believe there are angels among us,
Sent down to us from somewhere up above.
They come to you, and me
in our darkest hours,
to show us how to live,
to teach us how to give.
To guide us with the light of love.
To guide us with the light of. . . . . love.

Some times I feel this hollow swallowing me
She ran off to Gettysburg, went off with that new beau of hers
I snuck off after dark
It's a long way down the Canny Road, the stars were bright and the moon was low
Down where the blacktop highway starts.
I went down to Taneytown, I went down to Taneytown
I went down to see what I could see.
Now everybody stared at me, you'd think that they ain't never seen,
A colored boy before.
Well, they jumped at me and they called me names they'd a whupped me sure but the sheriff came
I slipped off and ran through the drygoods store
I ran down Division Street, but some of them boys followed me,
Down to the railroad track.
There was four of them & I came five, but I got my old Randall knife,
I cut that boy & I never did look back.
I went down to Taneytown, I went down to Taneytown
I went down to see what I could see.
Across the fields & woods I run, like a bullet from a rabbit gun,
Back home to my bed.
Ma came back from Gettysburg, her and that new beau of hers,
Boy you look like hell, was all she said.
A month went by without a word, till somebody down in the hollow heard,
About that boy they hung.
He begged those men to spare his life, but I dropped my bloody Randall knife,
He picked it up, so they thought he was the one.

We loaded it up with our innocent dreams and all the love we had
We didn't know then how hard it was livin' on our own
I'd find her crying late at night, talking to the folks back home
c. I bet Amy's back in Austin working at LaZona Rosa Cafe
I remember the night we lost it and the day she went away
Was it the anger words or did she miss her mama
I don't know but it don't feel right
I bet Amy's back in Austin and I'm missing her tonight
Working ten hours in a West Coast sun can make the days so long
And watching the moon crashing into the ocean alone sure gets old

Had a face of stone and a heart of gloom
 Lost my hope I was so far gone 
Cryin' all my tears with the curtains drawn
  I didn't know until my soul broke free
  I've got these angels watchin' over me
Oh watch me go I'm a happy girl everybody knows
That the sweetest thing that you'll ever see
=======================================================
 I used to hide in a party crowd 
Bottled up inside feeling so left out
 Standing in the corner wearing concrete shoes
With my frozen smile and my lighted fuse
  Now everytime I start to feel like that
  I roll my heart out like a welcome mat  
 Laugh when I feel like it Cry when I feel like it
 That's just how my life is That's how it goes
Oh watch me go I'm a happy girl and I've come to know
That the world won't change just 'cause I complain
Let the axis twirl I'm a happy girl
I'm a happy girl |

I knew it all then, thought you loved me I was wrong

Katydid sing like a symphony
Porch swing swaying like a Tennessee lullaby
Melody blowing through the willow tree
   What was I s'posed to do
  Standing there lookin’ at you?
lonely boy far from home
   Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights
 Maybe it was you, maybe it was me
But it sure felt right
Read about you in a Faulkner novel
Met you once in a Williams' play
Heard about you in a country love song
Summer night beauty took my breath away
  What was I s'posed to do
  Standing there lookin’ at you?
  Lonely boy far from home
    Maybe it was Memphis
Maybe it was southern summer nights

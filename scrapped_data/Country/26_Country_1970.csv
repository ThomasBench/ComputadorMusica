I wish I'd had an answer for all the questions on her mind
I wish I'd had a dime for all the times she needed me
I wish I'd realized but I was much too blind to see
All she wanted was to love me but all I did was turn away
If I'd known how much she needed me she might be here today
And if I'd only been more open and understood her ways
She might be in my arms tonight  but who am I so say
If I'd only been more loving when she needed a best friend
If I'd only patched up pieces that she needed me to mend
If I'd seen her troubled heart and figured out just what to do
She might be laying here tonight and saying I love you
All she wanted was to love me but all I did was turn away
If I'd known how much she needed me she might be here today
And if I'd only been more open and understood her ways
She might be in my arms tonight  but who am I so say
She should be in my arms tonight  but who am I to say

Thing that we could possibly do
Yeah, little buddy gonna get your chance

We'll record it live and that's no jive.

Gee, that was a wonderful show!
Oh, you haven't gone on yet?
Well, how was I supposed to know?
Hey! We got a great date it's really downtown
We're gonna get the Grand Canyon to do the sound
It's a boxing ring but it might be the thing
To really put you in the dough
Listen little brother, don't ya get us wrong
Why we even know the words to your song
Just say I do and we'll lay it on you
You! You! And me! Me! Me!

You couldn't hardly breathe
Heat lightning burnt the sky like alcohol
I sat on the porch without my shoes
And I watched the cars roll by
As the headlights raced to the corner of the kitchen wall
Mama dear, your boy is here
Far across the sea
Waiting for that sacred core
That burns inside of me
And I feel a storm
All wet and warm
Not ten miles away
Approaching my Mexican home
My God! I cried, it's so hot inside
You could die in the living room
Take the fan from the window, prop the door back with a broom
The cuckoo clock has died of shock
And the windows feel no pain
The air's as still as the throttle on a funeral train
Mama dear, your boy is here
Far across the sea
Waiting for that sacred core
That burns inside of me
And I feel a storm
All wet and warm
Not ten miles away
Approaching my Mexican home
My father died on the porch outside
On an August afternoon, I sipped bourbon and cried
With a friend by the light of the moon
So it's hurry! hurry! Step right up
It's a matter of life or death
The sun is going down and the moon is just holding its breath
Mama dear, your boy is here
Far across the sea
Waiting for that sacred core
That burns inside of me
And I feel a storm

Wond'ring where love has flown
Counting my tears alone

 I'm gonna tell you the name of an old man to see
 I'm gonna tell you right where to go.
 He's working in Capitol Saddlery
 He's sewing in the back of the place
 His name is Charlie Dunn the little frail one
 With the smile and the leathery face.
 Charlie Dunn, he's the one to see
 Charlie done the boots that are on my feet.
 It makes Charlie real pleased to see me walkin' in these
 Charlie Dunn, he's the one to see.
 Charlie's been makin' boots over there
 He says 'bout fifty some odd years.
 And once you wear a pair of his hand-mades boy,
 you'll never wear no store-bought pair.
 Charlie can tell what's wrong with your feet
 Just by feelin' 'em with his hands.
 And he can take a look at the boots you wear
 And know a whole lot about the man.
 Charlie Dunn, he's the one to see
 Charlie done the boots that are on my feet.
 It makes Charlie real pleased to see me walkin' in these
 Charlie Dunn, he's the one to see.
 And ol' Buck's up front he's countin' up his gold
 Charlie's in the back patchin' up the soles
 All the people comin' in smilin' at him
 They all wonder how's ol' Charlie been.
 Buck's makin' change but he never ever sees no one
 And he never understood a good thing ol' Charlie done.
 Charlie's never had his name on a sign
 He don't put a mark in the boot.
 He just hopes you can remember him
 'Bout the same way that he does you.
 He keeps your measurements in a lit-tle book
 So you can order more boots later on.
 Well I'm writin' down ol' Charlie's size
 I'm a makin' him up a song.

 Charlie done the boots that are on my feet.

Four o'clock and the TV's dead
Wired up with nothin' to do
I drunk all my whiskey I smoked all my beer
I'm already gone I just got here
 An old hairy ass hillbilly
Still up and hangin' on
Made me think of a similar time
In the Tropicannibal motel
Takin' showers 'bout every hour
'Cause I wasn't really feelin' well
Well in walked the Alabama Leanin' Man
His ol' buddy Billy Swann
 Two old hairy ass hillbillies
Still up and hangin' on
  Takes a friend to make you laugh
  A slap on the back
someone who knows right where you're at
 A friend in town who just heard you're around
 Came by to see how you're gettin' along
  Most people come out to clubs
Just to see an electric dildo
A human jukebox who loves to play
Every single song they know
But they don't care if you blow your soul
They usually stand up and tell you so
 And leave that hairy ass hillbilly
Still up and   hangin' on
  So wherever you may be tonight
  I wish you luck
You may be with a friend of yours
And may your friend be your lady love
But if you gotta go and do a show
  And afterwards you got no where to go

Sittin' and watchin' the wall
Tryin' to remember the good ole days
And wonderin' why the kids don't call

When his woman was alive
Now he reads his Gideon Bible and waits
For his welfare check to arrive
He got the hard time hungrys doin' the best that he can

There's a Tennessee housewife shoppin' in the market
Wearin' last year's jeans
She picks up a roast then changes her mind
Puts it back down and buys some more beans
Her old man's workin' in the filling station
And what's he gonna say
When he sits down to a table full of nothin'
After workin' like a dog all day
They got the hard time hungrys doin' the best that they can
I see the hard time hungrys spreadin' all over the land
A Mississippi farmer he watchin' the sky
Wonderin' if it's gonna rain
The payment's due on the tractor Lord
And the subsidy's been taken away
And in New York City a taxicab driver
Screams at the world outside
Cause it sure is hot and nobody's got
The money for a cross town ride
Lord they got the hard time hungrys doin' the best that they can
I see the hard time hungrys spreadin' all over the land
Now I ain't no preacher and I ain't no teacher
But one thing's sure as the sun
If the dollar keeps a droppin' and prices keep a risin'
The worst is yet to come

I've watched Your way of doing things
And tried to understand you more than most  (walk down)
No I haven't gone to church the way I ought to
But I always thought you knew in my own way I worshiped You  (walk down)
While even Your own children doubt and fail to understand
The simple way You go about the things You do
I've seen the doubt upon the face of loved ones
As they sadly placed a wreath of flowers on a tiny grave
And wondered why a child is brought into the world
To only live a little while and die you could have saved (walk down)
But I believe that in Your eyes this little child was something special
And You wanted it to be with You no doubt (walk down)
So with out-stretched arms You beckoned it so simple that I reckon
They can't understand the way You worked it out
Once I saw a young man growing till, he neared the age of knowing
Then I watched as something happened to his mind
No doctor could correct it, it was just as I suspected
And I marveled at Your way of being kind
They tried everything in vain and I was there when they explained it
To the family how he slipped into a trance
Guess You looked into the future watched him turn his back upon You
Loving him so much You couldn't take the chance
It took a lot of love to die for sinners such as I
And I guess that's why You've never given up on me
You understood when some denied You and even when they crucified You
Knowing all these things were meant to be (walk down)
For the stable's such a simple thing 
No wonder there were few who came
To see a king the night that You were born (walk down)

Help me to better understand

If I could take back all the things that caused you miser-y..
would you take another chance on me?
Would you take another chance on me?..I've paid for my mistakes.
Would you take another chance on me?..or have I changed too 
late?
Mmmm, I've been a fool, woman, for hurting you..but God, can't 
you see I'm sorry?
If you were only mine again, I'd make it up to you.
But my past keeps blinding you, if you could only see..would
you take another chance on me?

48,Lonesome Fiddle Man,Jerry Lee Lewis,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jerry-lee-lewis/lonesome-fiddle-man-chords-1776475,"The one that I took dancing the one that I called a baby
Walked down the aisle this morning with her old used to be
Waitress take the band another round and tell them it's on me
And ask them to do me one more favor please
Let that lonesome fiddle man take the lead
He gets the kind of sound that my lonely heart needs
I hear he's lost his darlin' just like me
Let that lonesome fiddle man take the lead
He struck a tune earlier this evening
A lonesome song called Faded Love his favorite melody
When I hear he's lost his darlin' just like me
Let that lonesome fiddle man take the lead

49,You Never Even Called Me By My Name (ver 4),David Allan Coe,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/david-allan-coe/you-never-even-called-me-by-my-name-chords-1470264,"Well it was all that I could do to keep from cryin'
Sometimes it seemed so useless to remain
But you don't have to call me darlin', darlin'
You never even called me by my name
You don't have to call me Waylon Jennings
And you don't have to call me Charley Pride
And you don't have to call me Merle Haggard anymore
  Even though you're on my fightin' side
And I'll hang around as long as you will let me 
and I never minded standing in the rain
But you don't have to call me darlin', darlin' 
You never even called me by my name
Well I've heard my name a few times in your phonebook (Hello? Hello?)
And I've seen it on signs where I've played
But the only time I know I'll hear David Allan Coe
  Is when Jesus has his final judgment day
So I'll hang around as long as you will let me 
and I never minded standing in the rain
But you don't have to call me darlin', darlin' 
You never even called me by my name
Well I was drunk the day my mom got out of prison
And I went to pick her up in the rain
But before I could get to the station in my pickup truck
  She got runned over by a damned old train
And I'll hang around as long as you will let me 
and I never minded standing in the rain
But you don't have to call me darlin', darlin' 
You never even called me
Well I wonder why you don't call me, 
Why don't you ever call me by my name?

0,On The Wings Of My Victory,Glen Campbell,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/glen-campbell/on-the-wings-of-my-victory-chords-1814464,"There is a road you must walk in this life
And there many who fall by the way
  I have seen the dark side of night
Now I'm lookin' at the light of a brand new day
   Like an Eagle soaring toward the sun
   Like a ship without the sea
By and by my soul will fly on the wings of my victory
I've been down in the depths of the night
Then sorely tempted and I've given in
  I've been burned by the heat of the fire
A more than one time loser   whose about to win
   Like an Eagle soaring toward the sun
   Like a ship without the sea
By and by my soul will fly on the wings of my victory
Many times I have walked all alone
Seen good ones die young and bad ones go right on
Seen faces turn away and hearts turn to stone
Now I found me a rock   that I can lean on
  Like an Eagle soaring toward the sun
  Like a ship without the sea
By and by my soul will fly on the wings of my victory
By and by my soul will fly on the wings of    my victory

1,A Womans Touch,Glen Campbell,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/glen-campbell/a-womans-touch-chords-1788193,"Right from the first day  
one man stood alone
And somehow he missed 
what didn't exist 
how could he have known
He looked all around him  
then he lifted his head
For he heard a voice 
and rose to rejoice 
as somebody said
This place needs a woman's touch  
to share in the plan
For without a woman's touch 
life don't mean much to a man
I was a drifter  
who couldn't be tamed  
So reckless and wild 
lost like a child 
whose dreams never came
Then I felt the pleasures  
of love's happiness
One look in your eyes 
and I realize  
I’ve truly been blessed
Thank God for a woman's touch  
to share in the plan
For it took my woman's touch  
to make me feel like a man
Lord without a woman's touch  
life don't mean much to a man

I ain't worth the trouble anyhow
I'd like to give it up, I've had enough and I've done my part
But I'm in too deep to pull out now
Good things we've had are going bad and I don't know why
I'd turn it around if I knew how
I'm pushing aside all my pride and it's worth a try
'Cause I'm in too deep to pull out now
We need to get our love back on its feet again
We've come too far to let it come to an end
What can I do, I'm into you up over my heart
I've tried all that I know how
Doing all I can and I can't stand to see us fall apart
And I'm in too deep to pull out now
We need to get our love back on its feet again
We've come too far to let it come to an end
I can't step aside and let you slide right out of my life

Now I'm a pretty big man around this town
I got me the hottest little Chevy around
My sweet little '66
She got a yellow front fender and a gray one on the back
But my income tax is comin' and I'm gonna paint her black
Sweet little '66
She got the 396, she got the four on the floor
And those stickers in the window ain't just for show
My sweet little '66
Now old Bubba and me built her back in '79
Then he went into the army so now she's all mine
Sweet little '66
I used to run her down a river road, make a little dough
Can't afford another ticket so I'm laying kinda low
Me and my '66
She got the 396, she got the four on the floor
And those stickers in the window ain't just for show
My sweet little '66
Now she ain't too good on gasoline, she burns a little oil
But she was built by Union labor on American soil
Sweet little '66
So when your Subaru is over and your Honda's history
I'll be blastin' down some back road with my baby next to me

She’s got a way with talkin’

She got my head in a spin
Got me wonderin’ where I been
Got me wonderin’ where I’m goin’ to
She’s got me dazed and confused
And shakin’ in my shoes
Ain’t really nothing I could do

I drove about in a black Corvette and I fooled around with chicks 
But that's all changed and I hear you ask, What in the world’s happened to him
Well I lost my head and I got wed and that's the reason for the state I'm in 
Cry, cry, don't ask me why but that's all she does each day
Moan, moan won't leave me alone and I give her all my pay
Scream, scream, even in my dreams, it's turning my hair grey
All I'm saying is I don't mind paying, just take that woman away

never knowing where im going or how long ill be gone
theres no need makin promises cause promises are something i cant keep
these highways are old memories ive traveled many times
and theres no destination on the road map in my mind
and somethings always calling me to a place i hope ill find
and this old road gets kinda lonesome 
and sometimes i get lonesome too
and i know it wont last forever
lonely is another state and im just passing through

He just wants to show her he cares
He always remembers those special occasions
And brags on the clothes that she wears
He does all the little things I never did
He knows all the right words to say
He's giving her what she deserves
Oh, I wish I had loved her that way
He always listens when she feels like talking
And he understands like a friend
He holds her close when she can't help crying
Oh, I wish I had held her back then
He's mending a heart that I left in pieces
He's found what I threw away
And he's giving her what she deserves
Oh, I wish I had loved her that way

Why do fools always find out too late

And make a million while she sings along
She thinks she?s heard the last of my love songs
But she won?t feel that way for long.

And last night so un clear
I see a trembling hand, and a gold wedding band
Wonder where do I stand
When the wild life be trays me, and I'm too far from home
Will you be there to save me
And shelter my heart till I'm strong
Or will you just hang up the phone
All my crazy old lies, and my worn out dis guise
Turns to tears in your eyes
What a fool I have been, there's no way I can win,
Unless you take me back in
When the wild life be trays me, and I'm too far from home
Will you be there to save me
And shelter my heart till I'm strong
Or will you just hang up the phone
When the wild life be trays me, And I'm too far from home
Will you be there to save me
And shelter my heart till I'm strong
Or will you just hang up the phone

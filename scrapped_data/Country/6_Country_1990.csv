Who,s never left home who's never struck out,
To find a dream and a life of their own,
A place in the clouds a foundation of stone.
Many precede and many will follow,
A young girls dreams no longer hollow,
It takes the shape of a place out west,
What it holds for her she hasn't yet guessed,
Wide open spaces,
Room to make her big mistakes,
She needs new faces,
She knows the high stakes
She traveled this road as a child,
Wide-eyed and grinning she never tired,
But now she won't be coming back with the rest,
If these are life lessons, she'll take this test
Wide open spaces,
Room to make her big mistakes,
She needs new faces,
She knows the high stakes
As her folks drive away her dad yells ""check the oil"",
Moms stares out the window and says ""I'm leaving my girl"",
She says ""it didn't seem all that long ago,
When she stood there and let her own folks know""
Wide open spaces,
Room to make her big mistakes,
She needs new faces,
She knows the high stakes

All them long and lonely nights I put you through
Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry

In my life again
Was I just off somewhere just too high

2,Something Like That,Tim McGraw,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tim-mcgraw/something-like-that-chords-701715,"It was Labor Day weekend I was  seventeen,
I bought a coke and some gasoline,
 And I drove out to the county fair.
When I saw her for the first time 
She was standing there in the ticket line,
 And it all started right then and there.
Ohh a sailor sky made a perfect sunset,
And that's a day I'll never forget.
I had a bbq stain on my white t-shirt,
She was killing me in that mini skirt.
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks.
She had a suntan line and red lipstick,
I worked so hard for that first kiss,
And a heart don't forget something like that.
It was five years later on a southbound plane,
I was headed down to New Orleans.
To meet some friends of mine for Mardi Gras.
When I heard a voice from the past,
Coming from a few rows back,
And when I looked I couldn't believe just what I saw.
She said ""I bet you don't remember me.""
And I said ""Only every other memory"".
I had a bbq stain on my white t-shirt,
She was killing me in that mini skirt.
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks.
She had a suntan line and red lipstick,
I worked so hard for that first kiss,
And a heart don't forget something like that.
Like an old photograph time can make a feeling fade,
But the memory of the first love never fades away.
I had a bbq stain on my white t-shirt,
She was killing me in that mini skirt.
Skipping rocks on the river by the railroad tracks.
She had a suntan line and red lipstick,
I worked so hard for that first kiss,
And a heart don't forget...no
And a heart don't forget...I said
And a heart don't forget something like that.

I'll hit the road, never lookin' behind.

nothin' more than travelin' hands of time
St. Genevieve can hold back the water,
but saints don't bother with a tear stained eye.
Seein' traces of the scars that came before
written in the pavement, still askin' for more
when the hours don't move along, worn-out wood and familiar songs
To hear your voice is not enough, is more than a shame.
Can you deny, there's nothin' greater
nothin' more than travelin' hands of time
St. Genevieve can hold back the water,
but saints don't bother with a tear stained eye.
Like a man said, rode hard and put away wet
throw away the bad news and put it to rest
If learnin' is livin', and the truth is a state of mind
you'll find it's better at the end of the line.

 And how to shelter from the rain
 And in the twinkling of an eye might have to be restrained

 That it's just a teddy bear
 And even somehow manage to vanish in the air
 And that is when I must beware

And settle down to just what they need livin' on  love
She don't care 'bout what's in  style
She just likes the way he  smiles
It takes more than marble and tile livin' on  love
Livin' on love, buyin' on  time
Without somebody nothin' ain't worth a  dime
Just like an old fashioned story book rhyme livin' on  love
It sounds simple. That's what you're  thinkin'
But love can walk through fire without  blinkin'
It doesn't take much when you get enough livin' on love
Two old people without a  thing
Children gone but still they sing
Side by side in that front porch swing livin' on  love
He can't see anymore. She can barely sweep the  floor
Hand in hand they'll walk though that door just livin' on  love
Livin' on love, buyin' on  time
Without somebody nothin' ain't worth a  dime
Just like an old fashioned story book rhyme livin' on  love

For to open twilights door
Her eyes are the stars in heaven
Watching o'er us all the while
And her heart it is in Ireland

We know not why were fighting
Or what we're dying for
They will storm us in the morning
When the sunlight turns to sky
Death is waiting for it's dance now
Fate has sentenced us to die

I can see your rolling fields of green
And fences made of stone
I am reaching out won't you take my hand
I'm coming home I-re-land
Oh the captain he lay bleeding
I can hear him calling me
These men are yours now for the leading
Show them to their destiny
As I look up all around me
I see the ragged tired and torn
I tell them to make ready
'Cause we're not waiting for the morn

And fences made of stone
I am reaching out won't you take my hand

As we forge the dark and fear
We can hear their horses breathing
As in silence we draw near
There are no words to be spoken
Just a look to say good-bye 
I draw a breath and night is broken
As I scream our battle cry
Ireland I am coming home
I can see your rolling fields of green
And fences made of stone
I am reaching out won't you take my hand

Summer flies and August dies
the world grows dark and mean
Comes the shimmer of the moon
on black infested trees
the singing man is at his song
the holy on their knees
The reckless are out wrecking
The timid plead their pleas
No one knows much more of this
than anyone can see anyone can see
There were days
and there were days
and there were days besides
when phantom ships with phantom sails
set to sea on phantom tides
Comes the lightning of the sun
on bright unfocused eyes
the blue of yet another day
a springtime wet with sighs
a hopeful candle lingers
in the land of lullabies
where headless horsemen vanish
with wild and lonely cries lonely cries
There were days
and there were days
and there were days I know
when all we ever wanted
was to learn and love and grow
Once we grew into our shoes
we told them where to go
Walked halfway around the world
on promise of the glow
Stood upon a mountain top
Walked barefoot in the snow
Gave the best we had to give
How much we'll never know we'll never know
There were days
and there were days
and there were days between
polished like a golden bowl
The finest ever seen
Hearts of Summer held in trust
still tender, young and green
left on shelves collecting dust
not knowing what they mean
Valentines of flesh and blood
as soft as velveteen

Little umbrella shaped margaritas
Coconut oil, tanned senioritas
Now I know how Jimmy Buffet feels

Gas pedal sticks, carries my car away
I was going  fast as a Rambler goes
I could feel the speed from my head to my toes
oh now I know how Richard Petty feels
I've been around the block a time or two
Done almost everything a boy can do
I've done some livin', yeah I've had fun
But there is one thing that I haven't done
 Saved two months bought a little diamond
tonight's the night feels like perfect timming
Down on one knee on momma's front steps

Oh, the snowflakes fell in silence
Over Belleau Wood that night
For a Christmas truce had been declared
By both side of the fight
As we lay there in our trenches
The silence broke in two
By a German soldier singing
A song that we all knew
Though I did not know the language
The song was ""Silent Night""
Then I heard my buddy whisper,
""All is calm and all is bright""
Then the fear and doubt surrounded me
'Cause I'd die if I was wrong
But I stood up in my trench
And I began to sing along
	Then across the frozen battlefield
	Another's voice joined in
	Until one by one each man became
	A singer of the hymn
Then I thought that I was dreaming
For right there in my sight
Stood the German soldier
'Neath the falling flakes of white
And he raised his hand and smiled at me
As if he seemed to say
Here's hoping we both live
To see us find a better way
	Then the devil's clock struck midnight
	And the skies lit up again
	And the battlefield where heaven stood
	Was blown to hell again
But for just one fleeting moment
The answer seemed so clear
Heaven's not beyond the clouds
It's just beyond the fear
No, heaven's not beyond the clouds
It's for us to find it here

at Web's and have him a drink 'for he went home to her
Andy Wo-Lo said hello
he said 'Hi, what's a doing', Wo
said sit down, I got some bad news that's gonna hurt.
Said I'm you best friend and you know that's right
But your young bride ain't home tonight
Since you've been gone she's been seeing that Amos boy, Seth
He got mad and he saw red
Andy said, Boy, don't you lose your head
Cause to tell you the truth, I've been with her myself
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Cause the judge in the town's got blood stains on his hands
Andy got scared and he left the bar
Walking on home cause he didn't live far
You see, Andy didn't have many friends and he just lost him one
Brother thought his wife must've left town
So he went home and finally found
the only thing Daddy left him and that was a gun
He went off to Andy's house
Slipping through the woods as quiet as a mouse
Come upon some tracks too small for Andy to make
He looked through the screen at the back porch door
He saw Andy lying on the floor
In a puddle of blood, and he started to shake.
The Georgia Patrol was making their rounds
so he fired a shot just to flag them down
A big bellied sheriff grabbed his gun and said,
Why'd you do it?
The judge said guilty in a make believe trial
Slapped the sherrif on the back with a smile
And said suppers waiting at home and I got to get to it
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Cause the judge in the town's got blood stains on his hands.
They hung my brother before I could say
the tracks he saw while on this way
to Andy's house and back that night were mine
And his cheatin' wife had never left town
That's one body that'll never be found
You see, little sister don't miss when she aims her gun
That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man

Every thunder cloud that came was one more I might not get through
But on the darkest day there's always light, and now I see it too
But I never liked the rain until I walked through it with you
I hear it falling in the night and filling up my mind
All the heaven's rivers come to light; I see it all unwind
I hear it talking through the trees and on the window pane
When I hear it I just can't believe I never liked the rain
Like the rain, I have fallen for you and I know just why you
Like the rain, always calling for you, I'm falling for you now 
Just like the rain.
When the cloud is rolling over, thunder striking me
It's as bright as lightning and I wonder why I couldn't see
That it's always good and when the flood is gone we still remain
Guess I've known all along I just belong here with you, falling
Like the rain, I have fallen for you and I know just why you
Like the rain, always calling for you, I'm falling for you now 
Like the rain, I have fallen for you and I know just why you
Just like the rain.
And when the night falls on our better days
And we're looking to the sky
For the winds that take us high above the plains
I know that we'll find better ways to look into the eye
Of the storms that will be calling

They said he got religion at the end and I'm glad that he did
Clayton was the best guitar picker in our town
I thought he was a hero and I used to follow Clayton around
I often wondered why Clayton who seemed so good to me
Never took his guitar and made it down in Tennessee
Well daddy said he drank a lot but I could never understand
I knew he used to picked up in Ohio with a five piece band
Clayton used to tell me son you better put that old guitar away
Ain't no money in it it'll lead you to an early grave
I guess if I'd admit it Clayton taught me how to drink booze 
I can see him half stoned a picking out the Lovesick Blues
When Clayton died I made him a promise I was gonna carry on somehow
I'd give a hundred dollars if he could only see me now
I remember the year that Clayton Delaney died
Nobody ever knew it but I went out in the woods and I cried
Well I know there's a lotta big preachers that know a lot more than I do
But it could be that the good Lord likes a little picking too

Point our rocking chairs towards the west
Plant our dreams where the peaceful river flows

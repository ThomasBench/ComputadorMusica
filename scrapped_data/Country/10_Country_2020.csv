[Asus9     X05430]
When the carnage was over
you could hear the cell phones ringing
You could smell gunpowder in the air
And on the bloody ground, the LEDs were blinking
“Deliver us from Evil, thoughts and prayers”
They’re lined up on the playground
Their hands all in the air
We see it on our news feed and we cry out in despair
They’re counting up the casualties,
Everyone’s choosing sides
There’s always someone to blame,
Never anywhere to hide
Thought and Prayers
Thoughts and Prayers
This white noise in my head, I think I need a filter
A pressure valve to keep from blowing up
And when the shit comes down I pray I can rise above it
Hold me closer when I've had enough
Thoughts and prayers
Thoughts and prayers
Glory, hallelujah
You are in our thoughts and prayers
Glory, hallelujah
You are in our thoughts and prayers
The Flat Earthist realized as he flew through the skies
The curve of the horizon as he fell
He saw the world was round just before he hit the ground
And gravity called out to close the deal
When my children's eyes look at me and they ask me to explain
It hurts me that I have to look away
The powers that be are in for shame and comeuppance
When Generation Lockdown has their day
They'll throw the bums all out and drain the swamp for real
Perp walk them down the Capitol steps and show them how it feels
Tramp the dirt down, Jesus, you can pray the rod they'll spare
Stick it up your ass with your useless thoughts and prayers
Stick it up your ass with your useless thoughts and prayers
Glory, hallelujah
You are in our thoughts and prayers
Glory, hallelujah
You are in our thoughts and prayers
Glory, hallelujah
You are in our thoughts and prayers

I want to remember everything we talk about
I want to feel light moving in everything you say
But part of me is caveated out
Like maybe certain circumstances are permissible
Maybe I just could and you could just look the other way
Is it so   wrong
I wanna feel good?
I wanna feel good
Is it   enough    now
just to want to
Even if you mean it?
I wanna feel good
Let's build us a new house for to live
You fortify the outside and I got the interior
I got the materials we're gonna need right here
Yeah, and it's weird to think I had it always
When manifestly I am the same as I ever was
I think the difference this time is that I could just walk away
Yeah, and now all things rushing out
I wanna feel good

2,Forever To Go,Chase Rice,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/chase-rice/forever-to-go-chords-2973188,"I can still see that dress you were wearing
  With those yellow wildflowers
I can still smell that vanilla in your hair when
  I was spinning you around
We just met and I knew then
But I couldn't say it out loud
So we just swayed while the music played
Kinda like we're doing right now
Another year down and baby somehow
Our song never gets old
The honeymoon phase and butterflies fade
But I'll never let you go
We were just kids stealing a kiss
And it feels like forever ago
But I love you more than yesterday
And we still got forever to go
(Forever to go)       
(still got forever to go)
(Forever to go)       
(still got forever to go)
I remember that moon hanging over the water
  At Fort Lauderdale Beach
Corona, lime and Tortuga Lights
  In our lawn chair seats
Bandana in your hair and your hand in the pocket
  Of my worn out jeans
That summer night did something right
And it's   still hard to believe
Another year down and baby somehow
Our song never gets old
The honeymoon phase and butterflies fade
But I'll never let you go
We were just kids stealing a kiss
And it feels like forever ago
But I love you more than yesterday
And we still got forever to go
Forever to go    
still got forever to go
Forever to go    
still got forever to go
Another sunrise     Another slow kiss
Another memory of you and me I won't forget
Another year down and baby somehow

The honeymoon phase and butterflies fade
But I'll never let you go
We were just kids stealing a kiss
And it feels like forever ago

Even got our name on 'em
I feel your love, I hear your laugh, got them take-me-way-on-back
Hurt-me memories, I don't want 'em
Up and down the boulevard
In and out of every bar
I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this   whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this   whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
I would start it where we started at the downtown party
Where you kissed my lips and stole my beer
The city park in the dark where we looked up at the stars
Watched them fireworks  pop last year
I'd start it under that Texaco   sign where you said goodbye
I'd get some gas and drop a match right there
I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this   whole town down

Goin' out, stayin' in, stayin' up, long nights
Now, I'm wakin' up alone, wishing I could move on
Blocked your number in my phone, thought it'd help, but it don't

 How's your mama, how you've been?

 Saw your sister at the Circle K
Heard baby number two was on the way

With you on my arm
It's good to hear from you again
Girl, what a coincidence
I was just thinkin' 'bout that weekend out on Cumberland Lake
And that one time in Baton Rouge when we made out in the rain
Where we went chasin' fallin' stars on a hill at your daddy's farm
Don't be sorry for callin' me up out of the blue
I was just thinkin' 'bout you (Oh)
I was just thinkin' 'bout you  (Mmm yeah)
 Hey, I just gotta say
I  heard your song the other day
And it put a smile on my face
When I started reminiscing
I've been on the edge of callin' you

Collided with the vehicle driving it out through the lightning

Then end back up on the same damn ground he started

The small amount we’re given must be some sort of crime
Yet the little we have feels like too much most of the time

Just waiting on the stars that will never align

Get it in peanut form and fill up a box
So that the crappy ash tray that your kid made in class
To send to Grandpappy don’t get cracked along the way
Hey, it's also used to make rafts for the US Military
I'm for anything that supports the US Military
Thousands of usages, all kinds of stuff

And top it off with brown liquor

Long nights shakin' in a stranger's house
With a bottle in my lap
Runnin' from the deafening sound
Of a future with no one around
From Barcelona to Vestal's Gap
And I spent countless hours walkin'
Among the rank and file
Prayin' to some vague set of eyes
That it's only for a while
Now I kneel before the only things I know
This set of keys and I told-you-so's
Someday, it'll be worth the miles
It was cigarettes outside an empty bar
On a dark December morning
Months of bad food and a pauper's guitar
Never heedin' any warning
I've had friends and I've let my friends down
Lookin' for my heart in the lost and found
Bare hands, tryin' to stop the rain from pourin'
And I been gainin' on the crack of dawn
With glass eyes and a smile
Prayin' Saint Faustina please
Let me go out in style
And I'll never know how far it goes
'Til the Devil reaps what I have sown
'Til then, I'm going to feel every mile

The twisted hand of heaven spreading terror all around
Sending farmers in a deeper debt and ranchers to the grave
Where towers mark the end of time with slowly spinning blades

You don't get to think that you can take it all back
You don't get to miss what you said we never had
I don't have to understand, you don't get to give a damn
After all you put me through, no, you don't get to
You don't, you don't, you don't, you don't get to
Did you come back 'cause I didn't break enough?
Did you hear that I was happy? You just had to mess it up
Or is it just some phase you're always going through?
To want what you can't have and leave it when you do
So you don't get to know what I do with my time
You don't get to say you ain't doing alright
You don't get to come around saying that you want me now
You don't get to show up with that look in your eyes
You don't get to think that you can take it all back

You don't, you don't, you don't, you don't get to
You don't get to kiss me and make it all better
You don't get to lay it all out in a letter
Blame it on something, break me like it's nothing
Just to love me back together
And you don't get to show up with your hair hanging down
Move a little closer like you're moving right now
I don't have to understand, you don't get to give a damn
After all you put me through, no, you don't get to
You don't, you don't, you don't, you don't get to

If thats the truth, then friend, I'm dying
I spent a lifetime salvaging shipwrecks
Falling so long I thought Is flying
Ive been falling so long I thought Is flying
Most folks I know don't have a problem
Reaching out when they're in trouble
But Im the kind of guy that hits rock bottom
Laughs and asks you for a shovel
I just laugh and ask you for a shovel
Any day that ends in Y is a good day to wreck it
Rip it all to pieces just to start brand new
But then I met you
Changed my way of thinkin
Now I don't want a day that doesn't start with you
Dont want a day that doesn't start
With you
She said why do you play all them sad songs?
Who went and hurt you so badly?
I just laugh and say baby, them sad songs
The only things that make me happy
Yeah, sad songs they make me happy
Like a dream she disappeared into the distance
Thats when I knew that Id been bitten
She Made me smile more in that instant
Then any sad song ever written
Every sad song ever written
Any day that ends in Y is a good day to wreck it
Rip it all to pieces just to start brand new
But then I met you
Changed my way of thinkin
Now I don't want a day that doesn't start with you
Dont want a day that doesn't start

My whole life
Set up shop on the wrong ones
At least a couple dozen times
For all of this to say
I just had to get out of my own way

Cash up front no questions asked
I gotta buddy's gotta friend said he needs some help
And we both know the rent don't pay itself

Throw that hammer down
And watch it all fade to black

And it's been a year since I've seen a deer and a smallmouth on the line
The other day I hooked a monster, and as I reeled him in
I thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""
I spent way less time in Nashville, more time in L.A
My back home buddies, they quit callin', thought I had too much on my plate
But last night, we cracked some cold beers and cranked Eric Church to ten
Man, it feels good to be country again
Yeah, I love me some California, but it sure ain't Tennessee
And my roots down there in Georgia, yeah, they started missin' me
And I wouldn't change the things I've done or the places that I've been
Man, it feels good to be country again
I traded in my Silverado, didn't need no four by four
I tucked my boots in the back of the closet, they didn't feel like me no more
But I dug 'em out and slipped 'em on, they been on my feet since then

I traded sunsets with my wife, for hours on my phone
And even when I was right beside her, I still wasn't really home
But last night, we built a fire, watched the moonlight kiss her skin

""Man, it feels good to be country again""
I saw the light, I found the way home

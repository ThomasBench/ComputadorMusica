I know You'll work it all for good but how long will it take?
I've been asking for healing and I'm not gonna lie
I'm ready for the miracle… God, let it be this time
But if I never see the promise on this side of the grave
My hope might be shaken but my faith will never break
Because I know the day is coming when You'll right all of the wrong
So I'll praise You in the waiting and my faith will stay strong
God, You taught me to trust You, You showed me how to believe
You're the author and the finisher of what You start in me
So I'm not gonna doubt it, I'm gonna hold on to peace
'Cause if I have You and nothing else, I still have everything
'Cause if I never see the promise on this side of the grave
My hope might be shaken but my faith will never break
Because I know the day is coming when You'll right all of the wrong
So I'll praise You in the waiting and my faith will stay strong
I'll count it joy when I am tested
'Cause You bring beauty from my pain, it's never wasted
But if I never see the promise on this side of the grave
My hope might be shaken but my faith will never break
Because I know the day is coming when You'll right all of the wrong
So I'll praise You in the waiting and my faith will stay strong
Because I know the day is coming when You'll right all of the wrong
So I'll praise You in the waiting and my faith will stay strong

1,Gas Well,Charles Wesley Godwin,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/charles-wesley-godwin/gas-well-chords-3948563,"I've never been too good to pick up a penny and lately I've been short of too damn many
Wife up and left, and baby in my ride, dog's at my feet beggin' for a bite
Empty pockets make sinners out of bona fide saints, swore to my daddy never tarnish his name
Droughts have been long and the floods have been fierce
Ain't made a profit on the farm in near a dozen years
There's money all around eight thousand feet down
Be a few more months 'fore the drill can break ground
So far behind every loan is dеnied and the bank has a mind to kick us out of herе
I'd see this whole world ground down to sand if I ever see the day that a suit takes my land
I've got a pistol and some TNT
There's an armoured truck on Tuesday carries what I need
I'm not proud of this cliff I'm jumpin'
But I've gotta make it through 'til the gas starts pumpin'
I'll take it on the road where no one will see
I know the mountains better than a warrior Cherokee
I grew up with Tommy and he did right by me
I'll take the cash he's guardin' and buy whatever I need
I've got a pistol and some TNT
There's an armoured truck on Tuesday carries what I need
I'm not proud of this cliff I'm jumpin'
But I've gotta make it through 'til the gas starts pumpin'
I hope daddy's not lookin' down as I wait here for that truck
And if he is I pray to God he sends a little luck
I've never been too good to pick up a penny and lately I've been swimmin' in so damn many
Every cheque I receive comes at a high price
Sometimes I visit Tommy's grave at night
And the well'll yield high for many years
And damn my reckonin' surely nears

It gets harder standing steady
And holding on gets tougher everyday

And an empty bourbon bottle by his bed
A pile of change, a worn-out match book with a name
And a number scribbled on it that can’t be read
Living all alone and in the red
I guess sometimes it’s worse than being dead
And he said, dying isn’t cheap
It’s a mighty hefty cost
When you’re doing it like me
You’ve already lost
Guess I’d go to hell
Since the only thing she left me
Was this old soul to sell
Since she set me free
Living don’t come easy and dying isn’t cheap
He said, that woman she was everything
But I guess I wasn’t everything to her
For that woman I gave anything
Now I’d give anything to drown the hurt
I guess I’ll live forever missing her
Because the pills and top shelf whiskey just don’t work
Dying isn’t cheap

You’ve already lost

You drove a Pontiac and my heart crazy
If you jumped off that river bank, hell, I'd do the same after you
I'd walk into that bar right behind
Catch a stare down with some old boy, let 'em know you were mine
Swore it was gonna last the rest of our lives
But fireworks in February turned to one damn cold July
And now I'm burning down this hole in the wall
And I'm just tryna make some sense of it all
Looking for answers on this old bar stool
Just tryna figure out life after love, after leaving
After too much drinking, after you
After you, I thought about taking that runway
To I don't care, anywhere but this rundown place
Leave all this shit and put my Chevy in drive
I'll take any town, any day, any state but outta my mind
And now I'm burning down this hole in the wall
And I'm just tryna make some sense of it all
Looking for answers on this old bar stool
Just tryna figure out life after love, after leaving
After too much drinking, after you
I should've ran after you
Fast as I can after you
I didn't know I was gonna need a plan after you
You can tell after you
It's been hell after you
I don't even know who I am after you
And now I'm burning down this hole in the wall
And I'm just tryna make some sense of it all
Looking for answers on this old bar stool
Just tryna figure out life after love, after leaving

After dreaming, after too much thinking, after you

I held it all together but I left it all behind
I didn't see you coming, coming down the line
Traffic in the atmosphere, salt inside your smile
Lessons I’m unlearning, back and forth in time
Coming up all rocky but opening my mind
I have been holding down long as I can remember, you know
The only thing I have depended upon has been me (Oh well)
But I’d like to rest on the shore
Before I go back and do more
And I’m taking a plane and a car straight to your door
The sap it runs in springtime
The thaw begins at night
My hips are moving forward
I come from a long line
Reckless deep abandon
Streets that open wide
I thought I wasn’t ready
I was ready all the time

The only thing I have depended upon has been me (Oh well)
But I’d like to rest on the shore
Before I go back and do more

Some folks want their time
I just like to spend my days
Seeking the divine, the divine, the divine

This time of year the rains never last
 Streets lights making all the sidewalks shine
I watch your taxi pull away
Realize I never really thought about this day
 Don't you worry now, you'll do fine
One heart pulled in two
Each on a different track
The same road that carries you
Will one day bring you back
I will wait for you
Yes, I'll be here, it's true
No matter where you go
Or what you do,
I will wait for you
Out in the madness of this world
Don't be alarmed by all the stories you have heard
  Don't you let them turn you around
There will be cuts and some will last
But love long and forgive fast
 And hold on tight to the ones you found
Hazy days and moonlit nights
They'll carry you along
And every word you choose to write
Shows you you belong
I will wait for you

No matter where you go
Or what you do,

I go out late so there's no one I will meet
 Watch the empty cars on the subway line
I wonder if you're scared at all
Afraid to walk, afraid you'll fall
 It's time to let your radiance shine
I know every reason why
You're a thousand miles away
Some nights I miss you more
More than I can say

When you get through,
I will wait for you

 Too long alone on the range

I just wanted to be seen
Heavy like the air before it rains, clean like grass and summer sage
I lost track of all the days
Warm like the sunshine on the pines, fresh tomatoes off the vine
Pickin’ peaches for the pie
Cold, like that first beer on my lips and those midnight skinny dips
Careful like your kiss
Lightning in a bottle, if only  I had known
I’d be back here after twenty years driving down this road
Wondering where that girl has gone and how to bring her back
Missing life when it was easier and love   when it was magic
Dark like that trail through the woods, sneaking out late when we could
My hand in yours fit good
Bright like Venus on the rise in the early morning sky
I grew up that night
Breathless, heart pounding in my chest, I placed your hand upon my breast
And surrendered to the rest
Lightning in a bottle, if only  I had known
I’d be back here after twenty years driving down this road
Wondering where that girl has gone and how to bring her back
Missing life when it was easier and love   when it was magic
And every dream I had back then is finally coming true
But last night I found the letter that I kept for years from you
And I wonder if I lost something somewhere along the way
I came back to find the piece of my heart buried in this place
Lightning in a bottle, if only  I had known
That summer flames burn out so just enjoy the afterglow
That time is touching all of us and the years are coming fast
Missing life when it was easier and love
Oh, love
Lightning in a bottle, if only  I had known
I’d be back here after twenty years driving down this road
Wondering where that girl has gone and how to bring her back
Missing life when it was easier and love   when it was magic

It don't matter much to me
So take these hands, throw them
Up into the wind and

49,Light In Your Eyes,Tenille Townes,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tenille-townes/light-in-your-eyes-chords-4166002,"It was something you said, we were driving
There was something on your mind
I was staring out the window at the pine trees
The memories flying by
You know when something just hits you
The right song with the windows down
And the radio tells all your secrets
Can't believe what you just found
I see a highway running straight and long into the western sky
I feel a little sad about it but I couldn't tell you why
Let the road go on forever, let the stars fall out of sight
'Cause, baby, you got the light in your eyes
It's more like a kind of flame burning ocean blue
I could stare at it forever like it's the only thing that's true
So, take me out, hold me close
Lift me up, bring me home
I see a highway running straight and long into the western sky
I feel a little sad about it but I couldn't tell you why
Let the road go on forever, let the stars fall out of sight
'Cause, baby, you got the light in your eyes
 Yeah, you do
     Uh ohhhh, uh oh I
Oh I see a highway running straight and long into the western sky
Yeah, I feel a little sad about it but I couldn't tell you why
Let the road go on forever, let the stars fall out of sight
'Cause, baby, you got the light in your eyes
Yeah, baby, you got the light
In your eyes
Yeah ah, yeah

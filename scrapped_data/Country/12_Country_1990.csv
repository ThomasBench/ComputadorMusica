0,Youre Still The One (ver 5),Shania Twain,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/shania-twain/youre-still-the-one-chords-2053515,"Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we'd get there someday
They said, ""I bet they'll never make it""
But just look at us holding on
We're still together still going strong
(You're still the one)
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one)
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night
Ain't nothin' better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missin'
They said, ""I bet they'll never make it""
But just look at us holding on
We're still together still going strong
(You're still the one)
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
(You're still the one)
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night

You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life

You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night
So glad we made it
Look how far we've come  my   baby.

1,Not The Only One,Bonnie Raitt,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bonnie-raitt/not-the-only-one-chords-2321665,"I was in a daze moving in the wrong direction
Feeling that I’d always be the lonely one
Then I saw your face on the edge of my horizon
Whispering that I wasn’t the only one the lonely one
One chance intervention see what it can signify
The slightest misapprehension baby and we’d have passed each other by
When I heard your sweet voice calling
Saw your light come shining through
I couldn’t stop my heart from turning, churning our my love for you
I was in a daze moving in the wrong direction
Feeling that I’d always be the lonely one
Then I saw your face on the edge of my horizon
Whispering that I wasn’t the only one the lonely one
True love or perfection   it seems like it’s overdue
Then just when you least expect it it come sneaking up on you
When I thought that I was dreaming felt your body close to mine
Now love takes on a different meaning together till the end of time
I was in a daze moving in the wrong direction
Feeling that I’d always be the lonely one
When I saw your face through the web of my confusion
Whispering that I wasn’t the only one the lonely one
Oh the lonely one

 I'm probably lucky I'm alive

that lights up just about dark.
A welcome beakon on a lost highway
when you're weary and when you've lost heart.

it's only the drinks and the band,
but something brings us back here again,
and again.

Mile after mile goes by

I think Kris and Merle are songwrittin' saviors
And Townes Van Zant, he died too soon
But now he’s up there with Hank and they’re both fightin’ the Nashville blues
Well the songwritin's left up to old hillbillies
Hippies and rednecks and girls like Miss Emmylou
I'm too young to have a point of view
But I just want to be a part of fightin' the Nashville blues
Fightin' the Nashville blues it ain't fun, no
It takes a toll upon your mind
But all the great ones they been there too
And they're all fightin' the Nashville blues
Well, I moved back to Austin to try to make a livin
But it ain't been so easy with those hill country women
And I'm stuck inside of this 8x12 room
And my throat's a scratchin' from the cigaretts and booze
And my face is wrinklin' and my mind's a strayin'
And I get on my knees and I get to prayin'
But my hands are worn like the soles of my shoes
And the Lord only knows I'm just fightin' the Nashville blues
I like Johnny Cash, Willie and Waylon
I think Kris and Merle are songwritin' saviors
Old Keith Whitley, he died too soon
Bun now he's up there with Hank
And there both fightin' the Nashville blues

I felt the yearning I felt the fire
In their touch but this goes deeper

Forever unfold oh you made me whole

Speak God's word and watch him flee

To the sound of a distant whippoorwill, or the hum of a passin' car,
It was where I first got up  the nerve to steal me my first kiss,

This feelin just keeps gettin' stronger as the time goes by
It's written on my face you can see it in my eyes
My love for you is true.

     Well this time girl I swear to you I'll listen
     help me understand where I went wrong

     Scared that I'll go crazy once you're gone

     once our love was strong, it can be again
     you said it takes two, to make love last
     you were right all along so help me hold on
     What have I got do to make it better?
     What have I got to do to make you see
     That even though I promised you forever
     I never knew how hard that would be
     I realize I took your love for granted
     but I've learned that love worth havin' don't come free
     and I'll pay any price it takes to keep you
     satisfied and stayin here with meeeeeeeeee

It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart.
Without saying a word, you can light up the dark.
Try as I may I can never explain.
What I hear when you don't say a thing.
The smile on your face let's me know that you need me.
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me.
The touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall.
You say it best, when you say nothing at all
All day long I can hear people talking out loud
But when you hold me near, you drown out the crowd.
Old Mr. Webster could never define,
What's been said between your heart and mine.

You always said the day that you would leave me
Would be a cold day in July
Your bags are packed not a word is spoken
I guess we said everything with good bye
Time  moves so slow and promises  get broken
On this cold day in July 
Sun's coming up coming up down on Main Street
Children shout as they're running out to play
Head in my hands here I am
Standing in my bare feet
Watching you drive away
Watching you drive away
You said that we were gonna last forever
You said our love would never die
It looks like spring and
It feels like sunny weather
But it's a cold day in July

Children shout as they're running out to play

The moon is full  my arms are empty

Sharpen them with lies

Will follow you around

You laugh at every joke
Drag your blanket blindly
And fill your heart with smoke
And the first thing that you want
Will be the last thing you ever need
That's how you fight it

Giant dripping leaves, spoons of powdered cream

Like those Indians lost in the rain forest

They all had forgotten how to start a fire
This is why people OD on pills
And jump from the golden gate bridge
Anything to feel weightless again
     Those poor lost Indians, when the white man found them
Most died of TB, the rest went insane
     In our motel room you're drinking slice and gin
Reading Moby Dick on the other bed
     Remember the first time we slept together?
You said it felt like when you learned to float
This is why people OD on pills
And jump from the golden gate bridge

You've been here forever, so clear in my mind
I just don't know where you are
But I know I'll find you but girl till I do
This is my love song for you
Let's hold hands on the porch swing, under the moon
While the wind through the willows plays us a tune
We can lie on a blanket, out back in the yard
And wish for our future on a far away star
And you'll feel the passion as time after time
I press your sweet lips to mine
We can dance to the radio, right up till dawn
Till you drift off to dream in my arms
You might be hundreds or more miles away
Or you might be just down the street
But there'll be a hunger deep in your eyes
That I'll recognize when we meet
It might take hours or it might take years
But this is the song you will hear
And you'll feel the passion as time after time

We can dance to the radio, right up till dawn

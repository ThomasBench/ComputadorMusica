Sold I to the merchant ships
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit
But my hand was made strong
By the hand of the almighty
We forward in this generation
Triumphantly
Won’t you help to sing
These songs of freedom?
Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs
Redemption songs
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Some say it’s just a part of it
We’ve got to fulfill the book
Won’t you help to sing
These songs of freedom?
Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs
Redemption songs
Old pirates yes they rob I
Sold I to the merchant ships
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Some say it’s just a part of it
We’ve got to fulfill the book
So Won’t you help to sing
These songs of freedom?
Cause all I ever have
            Redemption songs
      All I ever have
            Redemption songs
These songs of freedom?
      Songs of freedom?

ridin' on a midnight bus bound for Mexico
One was headed for vacation, one for higher education
and two of them were searchin' for lost souls
That driver never ever saw the stop sign
and eighteen-wheelers can't stop on a dime.
There are three wooden crosses,
on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows
I guess it's, not what you take
when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go
That farmer left a harvest,   a home and eighty acres
the faith and love for growin' things
in his young sons heart
And that teacher left her wisdom
in the minds of lots of children
Did her best to give'em all a better start
And that preacher whispered,
""Can't you see that promised land?""
as he laid his blood-stained bible
in that hookers hand
There are three wooden crosses
on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows
I guess it's, not what you take
when you leave this world behind you
it's what you leave behind you when you go
That's the story that our preacher told last Sunday,
as he held that blood-stained bible up
for all of us to see
He said, bless the farmer, and the teacher,
and that preacher
Who gave this Bible to my Momma, Who read it to me
There are three wooden crosses
on the right side of the highway
why there's not four of them, now I guess we know
It's not what you take,
when you leave this world behind you,
It's what you leave behind you when you go
There are three wooden crosses
on the right side of the highway

Headlights shining like silver moons rollin' on the ground

And we made time look like time could never fade
Friday night we both made the guitar hum
Saturday made Sunday feel like it would never come
Gonna be a long Monday
Sittin' all alone on a mountain
By a river that has no end
Gonna be a long Monday
Stuck like the tick of a clock
That's come unwound again
Soul to soul, heart to heart and cheek to cheek
Come on baby, give me a kiss that'll last all week
The thought of you leavin' again brings me down
The promise of your sweet love brings me around
Gonna be a long Monday
Sittin' all alone on a mountain
By a river that has no end

knowin that he couldnt have his toy till his nuggets were gone
A green traffic light turned straight to red, I hit my brakes and mumbled under my breath
His fries went a flyin' and his orange drink covered his lap
Well, then my 4 year old said a 4-letter word, 
it started with ""s"" and I was concerned,
So I said son, now where'd you learn, to talk like that.
He said Ive been watchin' you dad ain't that cool,
I'm your buckaroo I wanna be like you
And eat all my food, and grow as tall as you are.
We got cowboy boots and camo pants yea we're just alike hey aint we dad
I wanna do everything you do(hold), 
So I've been watchin you
We got back home and I went to the barn, I bowed my head and I prayed real hard,
Said Lord please help me help my stupid self
Just this side of bedtime later that night, turning on my son's scooby doo night light
He crawled out of bed and he got down on his knees
He closed his little eyes, folded his little hands,
Spoke to God like he was talkin' to a friend,
And I said son, now where'd you learn, to pray like that
He said I been watchin you dad ain't that cool,
Im your buckaroo I wanna be like you,
And eat all my food, and grow as tall as you are,
We like fixin' things and holdin' mama's hand
yea we're just alike hey ain't we dad,
I wanna do, everything you do(hold),
So I've been watchin' you
With tears in my eyes I wrapped him in a hug
Said my little bear is growin' up
And he said but when I'm big, I'll still know what to do.
Cause I've been watchin' you dad aint that cool
I'm your buckaroo I wanna be like you,
And eat all my food, and grow as tall as you are
By then I'll be strong as superman,
We'll be just alike hey won't we dad,

I make a lot of noise cause the girls, they are so pretty
Riding up and down Broadway on my old stud Leroy

Save a horse, ride a cowboy
Everybody says

Well, I don't give a dang about nothing
I'm singing and bling-blanging while the girls are drinking long necks down

As I was gettin' buzzed on suds out on some back country road
We were flying high, fine as wine, having ourselves a big and rich time
And I was going, just about as far as she'd let me go
But her evaluation of my cowboy reputation
Had me begging for salvation all night long
So I took her out giggin' frogs, introduced her to my old bird dog
And sang her every Willie Nelson song I could think of and we made love

How's it hit 'cha when you get that kind of news, man what'cha do, and he said
I went sky diving, I went rocky mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu
And I loved deeper and I spoke sweeter and I    gave forgiveness I'd been denying
and he said some day I hope you get the chance to live like you were dying
He said I was finally the husband    that most the time I wasn't
And I became a friend a friend would like to have
And all of a sudden going fishin' wasn't such an imposition
And I went three times that year I lost my      dad

at what I'd do if I could do it all again, and then...

I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu
And I loved deeper and I   spoke sweeter and I   gave forgiveness I'd been denying
and he said some day I hope you get the chance to live like you were dying
Like tomorrow was a gift and you got eternity to think about what you'd do with it

What did I do with it
What would I do with it

That's what they say
Everything I ever done
Gonna give it away.
Someone hit the big score
They figured it out
We're gonna do it anyway
Even if doesn't pay.
I can get a tip jar
Gas up the car
Try to make a little change
Down at the bar.
Or I can get a straight job
I've done it before
Never minded working hard
It's who I'm working for.
Everything is free now

Every day I wake up
Humming a song
But I don't need to run around
I just stay home.
Sing a little love song
My love of myself
If there's something that you want to hear
You can sing it yourself.
'Cause everything is free now
That's what I said
No one's got to listen to
The words in my head.

And I figured it out
That I'm gonna do it anyway

Well it oughtta be more than enough to get you through

And there are fancy cars and diamond rings
But you know that they don't mean a thing 
They all add up to nothin compared to you
Well, remember me in ribbons and curls
I still love you more than anything in the world

36,The Little Girl,John Michael Montgomery,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-michael-montgomery/the-little-girl-chords-764463,"Her parents never took the young girl to church,
Never spoke of His name, never read her His Word.
Two non-believers walking lost in this world.
Took their baby with them, oh what a sad little girl.
Her daddy drank all day and mommy did drugs.
Never wanted to play or give kisses and hugs.
She'd watch the TV and sit there on that couch,
While her mom fell asleep and her daddy went out.
And the drinking, and the fighting,
Just got worse every night.
Behind their couch, she'd be hiding,
Oh what a sad little life.
And like it always does, the bad just got worse,
With ever slap, and every curse.
Until her daddy in a drunk rage one night,
Used a gun on her mom, and then took his life.
Then some people, from the city,
Took the girl far away.
To a new mom, and a new daddy.
Kisses and hugs every day.
First day of Sunday school, the teacher walked in,
Saw a small little girl, staring at a picture of him.
She said I know that man, there on that cross,
I don't know his name, but I know he got off.
Cause he was there in my old house,
Held me close to his side.
As I hid there behind our couch.
The night that my parents died.

0,Trail Of Tears (ver 2),Billy Ray Cyrus,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/billy-ray-cyrus/trail-of-tears-chords-3444641,"Too many broken promises too many trail of tears
Too many times you were left cold for oh so many years
Too many times you walked away and was made to feel ashamed
And though you only tried to give you were often blamed
How can this world be so dark so unfair and so untrue
How did the cards of life fold right on top of you
God in heaven hear my prayer if you are still above
Send the children hopes and dreams and lots and lots of love
For this I only ask of you to conquer all their fears
And let them soar like eagles across the trail of tears

Lashed my soul 'cross this twin-v horse and rode off in the night
Guess you noticed I'm gone and the old mornin' sun's castin' shadows with questions inside
So the truth in this letter at dawn will shed a new light
Truth  is, I lied when I said I'd always be your whippin' pet
I lied when I said I didn't mind the hurt I guess
When I pleaded and stated I needed you just to survive (I lied)
Truth  is, last night when you tore my heart apart my mind began
Never thinkin' 'bout thinkin' like your fool again
And the freedom that filled me kept spellin' out truth as I'd write
Truth  is  I li - ed
Saw an image of you where the highway touched the sky
It was blockin' my view so I steered that thought aside
Now the mornin' and me ride a cold memory past tomorrow to some other town
Where we'll never care whether this truth was lost or found
Truth  is   I lied when I said I'd always be your whippin' pet
I lied when I said I shouldn't mind the hurt I guess
When I pleaded and stated I needed you just to survive (I lied)

When you spend your whole life wishing,   wanting and wondering why
It's a long enough life to be living, why walk when you can fly
In this world there's a whole lot of golden
In this world there's a whole lot of plain
In this world you've a soul for a compass
And a heart for a pair of wings
There's a star on the far horizon, rising bright in an azure sky
For the rest of the time that you're given, why walk when you can fly

In Jacksonville, Illinois
When asked what my name was there came no reply
They said I was a deaf and sightless half wit boy
But Louis was my name, though I could not say it
I was born and raised in New Orleans
My spirit was wild, so I let the river take it
On a barge and a prayer upstream
Well, they searched for a mother
And they searched for a father
And they searched till they searched no more
The doctors put to rest their scientific tests
And they named me 'John Doe No. 24'
And they all shook their heads in pitty
For a world so silent and dark
Well, there's no doubt that life's a mystery
But so too is the human heart
And it was my heart's own perfume
When the crepe jasmine bloomed on saint Morgue Avenue
Though I couldn't hear the bells
Of the streetcars coming by toeing the track I knew
And if I were an old man returning
With my satchel and porkpie hat
I'd hit every jazz joint on Bourbon
And I'd hit everyone on Basin after that
The years kept passing as they passed me around
From one state ward to another
Like I was an orphan shoe from the lost and found
Always missing the other
And they gave me a harp last Christmas
And all the nurses took a dance
But lately I've been growing listless
I've been dreaming again of the past
I'm wandering down to the banks
Of the great Big Muddy where the shotgun houses stand
I am seven years old and I feel my dad
Reach out for my hand
While I drew breath no one missed me
So they won't on the day that I cease
Put a sprig of crepe jasmine with me
To remind me of New Orleans

Back where the sun can find you
Under the wise wishing tree
And with all of them made we'll lie under the shade
And call it a jubilee
And I can tell by the way you're talking
That the past isn't letting you go
But there's only so long you can take it all on
And then the wrong's gotta be on its own
And when you're ready to leave it behind you
You'll look back, and all that you'll see
Is the wreckage and rust that you left in the dust
On your way to the jubilee

That you're still expecting to hear
Your name being called like a summons to all
Who have failed to account for their doubts and their fears
They can't add up to much without you
And so if it were just up to me
I'd take hold of your hand, saying come hear the band
Play your song at the jubilee
And I can tell by the way you're searching
For something you can't even name
That you haven't been able to come to the table
Simply glad that you came
And when you feel like this try to imagine
That we're all like frail boats on the sea
Just scanning the night for that great guiding light
Announcing the jubilee
And I can tell by the way you're standing
With your eyes filling with tears
That it's habit alone keeps you turning for home
Even though your home is right here
Where the people who love you are gathered
Under the wise wishing tree
May we all be considered then straight on delivered
Down to the jubilee
'Cause the people who love you are waiting
And they'll wait just as long as need be

Is a love that's forever
Someone who can capture my soul in a heartbeat
And stay for all time
What I'm prayin' for
Is a match made in Heaven
Someone who will worship my body
And still put his heart on the line
Commitment
Someone who'll go the distance
I need somebody with staying power
Who will make me go weak in the knees
Commitment
And everything that goes with it
I need honor and love in my life from somebody
Who's playin' for keeps
What I'm searching for
Is a man who'll stand by me
Who will walk through the fire
And be my flame in the night
I won't settle for less
Than what I deserve
A friend and a lover who'll love me
For the rest of my life
Commitment
Someone who'll go the distance
I need somebody with staying power

Honesty can really cut you down to size

Soon you'll know why people say talk is cheap
Life is just one big compromise

Keep on shining, keep on smiling
Don't lose faith and don't lose heart
When you're crying just keep trying to remind yourself
You're a shining star Yes, you are
Somewhere down the line you'll face your judgement day
When the angels look at you they will say
We've got a way of knowing who qualifies
Just let them see that light in your eyes

        She goes direct to my heart
    And when it comes to lovin' me
   She's everything I need, bulls-eye perfect
   She's right on the money
She's no red lights when I've overslept
She's a three point jump shot that's nothing but net
A hand full of aces, when the dealer's done dealin'
I'm forever on a roll, that's how she's got me feeling
        right on the money
        She goes direct to my heart
    And when it comes to lovin' me
   She's everything I need, bulls-eye perfect
   She's right on the money
She's the best cook that's ever melted cheese
I ain't much around the house, but I aim to please
There's absolutely no reason to doubt her
When she says I wouldn't last ten minutes without her
        right on the money
        She goes direct to my heart
    And when it comes to lovin' me
   She's everything I need, bulls-eye perfect
   She's right on the money
        right on the money
        She goes direct to my heart
    And when it comes to lovin' me
   She's everything I need, bulls-eye perfect
She's

And lord, I've heard it all
A rumour's not a stranger in this town
Now me, I pay no mind
But it's hitting home this time
Now I've been told you've gone and let me down
Straight from you____
Is it rumour or truth
It would break my heart in two____
But if it's gonna be bad news____
I need to hear it straight from you
I need to hear it straight from you___
They all know her name
You didn't spare me any shame
I wonder did you even try to hide
I think that you owe me
Just a little honesty
And even though you told me with your eyes
Straight from you____

It would break my heart in two____

You said I stole your heart away by looking in your eyes
I wonder now how many times you sold that pack of lies
If this is how you act when you give your heart away
Well, take it back, take it back
Then tell me what you're doing now sneaking out the back door
You're bringing home flowers and a bottle of Chablis
You forgot I don't drink wine, I know that bottle's not for me
If this is how you act when you give your heart away
Well, take it back, take it back
Oh, you must think I'm blind and I don't smell your new cologne
You don't think I notice all the nights I've spent alone
Well, I'm not one for sitting 'round in some ole pity pool
You think you got a ticket and I must be some kind of fool
I hate to steal your thunder but your playing days are through
At least they are with me 'cause babe, I got no use for you
Tonight laying on the street babe, your bag is packed
So, take it back, ah take it back

Those are crazy schemes that fill your fool head
But it was clear from the moment we met
We could prove them wrong
All my life I heard that same old story
Dare to dream and you'll just be sorry
I might have given up my shot at glory
But then you came along
We're not expecting this to go down easy
We're not expecting any sweet dreams, sure thing
But with a little luck, could be we'll be
Winding up the way we planned
Heading for our promised land
Holding one last good hand
Something's calling us, I know you hear it
Day by day I feel us growing near it
But once you find a kindred spirit
There's nothing you can't do
Oh baby, I'm not saying we won't ever stumble
Some days will be rough and tumble
You and I know that life's a gamble
But I'll bet mine on you____

48,For Herself,Reba McEntire,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/reba-mcentire/for-herself-chords-1814579,"Uncle Slim had let her know she couldn't ride that horse
He was the one that was only meant for men
She waited 'round 'til way after dark
Rode that horse with all her heart
And in the night how she rode
Somehow she always knew she had the strength inside
And even if she fell, she'd survive
In spite of all the tears she may cry
This is how she has to live her life
As hard as it may be, she has to find out for herself
Mama and daddy told her from the start he was no good
They'd seen how he treated the other girls
She waited around till the sun went down
Slipped out of the house not making a sound
And in the night, oh, how they drove
Somehow she always knew she had the strength inside
And even if she fell, she'd survive
In spite of all the tears she may cry
This is how she has to live her life
As hard as it may be, she has to find out for herself
It was fifteen years to the day
He became a stranger in her eyes
In the coldest words of anger
He said without me you won't survive
There's a suitcase in the closet she had packed six months ago
She don't leave a note that's not her style
So she waited around till way after dark
Left that man who broke her heart
Now she's gone, oh, she's gone
Somehow she always knew she had the strength inside
And even if she fell, she'd survive
In spite of all the tears she may cry
This is how she has to live her life
As hard as it may be, she has to find out for herself
Yes, she's gotta find out for herself

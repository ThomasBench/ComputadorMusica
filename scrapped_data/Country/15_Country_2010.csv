0,Church Bells (ver 2),Carrie Underwood,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/carrie-underwood/church-bells-chords-1803004,"Jenny grew up wild, like a blackfoot daisy    
Out in the shack with a blue tick hound    
Broke as hell, but blessed with beauty    
The kind that a rich man can't turn down    
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing    
One summer night in a dime store dress    
She had the looks, he had the mansion    
And you can figure out the rest    
He was all roses, dripping in diamonds, sipping on champagne    
She was all uptown, wearing that white gown, taking his last name    
She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing    
And up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing    
Fold your hands and close your eyes Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing   Yeah, they're ringing    
Jenny was hosting Junior League parties    
And having dinner at the country club    
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie    
But Ken was always getting way too drunk    
Saturday night, after a few too many    
He came home ready to fight    
And all his money could never save Jenny    
From the devil living in his eyes    
It was all bruises, covered in makeup, dark sunglasses    
And that next morning, sitting in the back pew, praying with the baptist   
She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing    
And up in the loft, that whole choir singing, singing    
Fold your hands and close your eyes Yeah, it's all gonna be alright 
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing  Yeah, they're ringing   
Jenny slipped something in his Tennessee whiskey    
No law man was ever gonna find    
And how he died is still a mystery    
But he hit a woman for the very last time    
She could hear those church bells ringing, ringing    
Standing there in a black dress singing, singing     
Fold your hands and close your eyes Yeah, it's all gonna be alright 
And just listen to the church bells ringing, ringing   Yeah, they're ringing

1,Save It For A Rainy Day (ver 4),Kenny Chesney,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/kenny-chesney/save-it-for-a-rainy-day-chords-1776916,"It's no secret that lately there ain't no escape, and that I've been waking up alone
Just me and the TV and a sinking feeling that you ain't ever coming home
But today, the tears ain't gonna hit the floor cause the boat's in the bay and it's calling my name
So I'm heading on out the door
Cause the sun is too bright, the sky is too blue, beer's too cold to be thinking 'bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away, save it for a rainy day
When I turned the ignition I knew I'd been missing
The feel of the wind on my face
I was stuck in a habit of wondering what happened
Two days you're taking all the blame
Got a drink, or two, that's as fool proof a remedy
It's a beautiful world with a beautiful girl
Kinda making eyes at me
Cause the sun is too bright, the sky is too blue, beer's too cold to be thinking 'bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away, save it for a rainy day
Yeah, the music's too good, my friends are all out
And they're all too high to be bringing them down
If they ask about you, I've got nothing to say
I'll save it for a rainy day
There'll be plenty of time for what ifs and why's
And how'd I let you get away
But the lying in bed all stuck in my head
Cause the sun is too bright, the sky is too blue, beer's too cold to be thinking 'bout you
Gonna take this heartbreak and tuck it away, save it for a rainy day
Yeah, the music's too good, my friends are all out
And they're all too high to be bringing them down
If they ask about you, I've got nothing to say

2,You Are In Love (ver 2),Taylor Swift,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/taylor-swift/you-are-in-love-chords-1674179," One look, dark room
 Time moved too fast
 Buttons on a coat
 No proof not much
 Small talk, he drives
 The light reflects
 He says look up
 No proof, one touch
 You can hear it in the silence, silence
 You can feel it on the way home, way home
 You could see it with the lights out, lights out
 You are in love, true love
 You are in love
 Morning, his place
 You keep his shirt
 And for once you let go
 One step, not much, but it said enough
 You kiss on sidewalks
 One night he wakes, strange look, his face
 Pauses, then says, you're my best friend
 You knew what it was, he is in love
 You can hear it in the silence, silence
 You can feel it on the way home, way home
 You can see it with the lights out, lights out
 You are in love, true love
 So it goes
 You two are dancing in a snow globe, round and round
 He keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
 And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
 And why I spent my whole life try to put it into words
 'Cause you can hear it in the silence
 You can feel it on the way home
 You could see it with the lights out
 You are in love, true love
 You are in love
 You can hear it in the silence, silence
 You can feel it on the way home, way home
 You could see it with the lights out, lights out
 You are in love, true love
 You are in love
 You can hear it in the silence, silence
 You can feel it on the way home, way home
 You could see it with the lights out, lights out
 You are in love, true love

When no one's left to call you home

I'm a little lost at sea
I'm a little birdie in a big old tree
Ain't nobody looking for me

Somedays, I think it's all okay
Some nights, I throw it all away

Keep on ridin' 'til i see that dawn

The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
Walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah
We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard
not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent mindedly
 makin' me want you

it gets better than
this You take my hand and drag me

he calls exactly when
he says he will

Talks business with my father

2am and I'm cursing your name

Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush

i dont need you but
i do, i do, i do
you say theres nothing you can
say to make this right again

i dont know how
it gets better than this
you take my hand and drive me

faded picture of a beautiful night

broke down crying was she worth this mess?after
everything and that little black dress after
 everything i must confess

She used to be a beauty you can tell
The lights down in the lobby they don't shine
They just flicker while the elevator whines
And the couple in the corner of the bar
Have traveled light and clearly traveled far
She's got nothing left to learn about his heart
They're sitting there a thousand miles apart

I'll throw rocks at your window from the street

And cowboy boots for seven dollars more
And I remember how you loved to see them shine
So I run upstairs and get a pair of mine
And there's a painting on the wall beside the bed
The watercolor sky at Hilton Head
Then I see you in that summer when we met
And that boy you left in tears in his Corvette
Baby let's not ever get that way
I'll drive you to the ocean every day
We'll stay up in the presidential suite
And call ourselves the flagship of the fleet

And in spite of all the evidence believe
And volunteer to lose touch with the world
And focus on one solitary girl

Like hard times when a loved one dies
Or heartache in an empty home

And there's nothing for the woman left to take from a man

All the lies told to protect us and keep from breaking our hearts

Early marriages and empty graves

We read all the right books, we sang songs we misunderstood
And with or without any reason, we did rebellion what justice we could

12,American Pie,Garth Brooks,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/garth-brooks/american-pie-chords-47431,"A long, long time ago,
I can still remember how that music used to make me smile
And I know if I had my chance,
That I could make those people dance and maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver, with every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep, I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried when I read about his widowed bride
Something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' this will be the day that I die, this will be the day that I die
Did you write the book of love
And do you have faith in god above, if the bible tells you so?
Do you believe in rock and roll
Can music save your mortal soul and can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well I know that you're in love with him  'cuz I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes, man I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck with a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck the day the music died, I started singin'
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news, but she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before, but the man there said the music
wouldn't play
But in the streets the children screamed, the lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken, the church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most, the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast the day the music died,
And they were singin'
So bye, bye Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
And them good old boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' this will be the day that I die

And the thunder cries
That’s when I would hold you tight

I’d get real close and whisper goodnight
And I’m layin’ down thinkin’ ‘bout

Yeah I should be cleanin’ my closet
Anything to keep my mind from runnin’ back to you
Instead I’m lookin’ up at the ceilin’

But I don’t care at all I was destined to be poor
I was destined to stay in this city
New Orleans in the morning after Mardi Gras
Is like the sweetest hangover you ever saw
All the buildings sag, beads hang from the trees
In the pink sky dawn I stumbled to Lafitte’s
In the corner of the bar with a notepad and a pen
A little hair of the dog, I wrote Mr. Tambourine Man 
When the apocalypse is over, I hope you like your job
Ain’t it a shame nobody sets anybody free anymore
I hate a song where the singer is mad at their ex
Cause they said they’d always love ‘em now they’ve gone up and left
And they complain and they whine, and they want ‘em to come back home
I say, out of seven billion people, let the ones who don’t love you go
When the apocalypse is over, I hope you like your job
Ain’t it a shame nobody sets anybody free anymore
Never trust a musician who plays with their eyes open
All the good stuff happens when they’re closed
You gotta give yourself the shivers before you can give ‘em to someone else
So I wrote Mr. Tambourine Man and I left it in the dust
The perfect song is the song that you only got to play once
I don’t wanna be no dinosaur blaming the asteroid for my strife
I might’ve been born yesterday, but I’ve been up all night
When the apocalypse is over, I hope you like your job
Ain’t it a shame nobody sets anybody free anymore

When I thought about my wife

From somewhere up above
No greater gift has man than to lay down his life for love   (12th Fret Palm Mute)

       Could I make that sacrifice

I dont understand it all myself
Theres a brother on my left and another on my right
And in his pocket just like mine 
Hes got a photograph
And theyre waiting for him back home
Its weighing on my mind
Im not trying to be a hero
I dont wanna die
But right now in this moment
You dont think about right
You dont think about wrong
You just do what you gotta do
      To fend your own
And Id do the same, for you.

After all that I'd found, in my circles around the world, was there anything left?
""Gentlemen,"" I said, ""I've studied the maps, and if what I am thinking is right,
There's another new world, at the top of the world, for whoever can break through the ice,""
I looked 'round the room, in that way I once had, and I saw that they wanted belief,
So I said, ""All I've got are my guts and my God,"" then I paused, ""and the Annabel Lee.""
Oh, the Annabel Lee, I saw their eyes shine, the most beautiful ship in the sea,
My Nina, my Pinta, my Santa Maria, my beautiful Annabel Lee
That spring we set sail, and the crowd waved from shore, and on board the sailors waved caps,
But I'd never had family, just the Annabel Lee, so I never had cause to look back.
I just studied the charts, set the course north, and towards dark I drifted toward sleep,
And I dreamed of the fine, deep harbor I'd find past the ice, for my Annabel Lee.
After that it got colder, and the world got quiet. It was never quite day or quite night.
And the sea turned the color of sky turned the color of sea turned the color of ice.
After that all around us was fastness, one glassy desert of arsenic white,
And the waves that once lifted us, shifted instead into drifts against Annabel's sides.
And the crew gathered closer, at first for the comfort, but each morning would bring a 
Of tracks in the snow, leading over the edge of the world, til I was the only one left.
After that it gets cloudy, But it feels like I laid there for days, or maybe for months
But Annabel held me, the two of us happy, Just to think back on all we had done
I told her {We talked) of the other new worlds We'd discover as she gave up her body to me,
As I chopped up her mainsail for timber, I told her of all that we still had to see.
As the ice {frost} turned her mooringsTo nine-tails and the wind lashed her sides in the cold,
I burned her to keep me alive every night in the loving embrace of her hold.
I can't {won't} call it rescue,What brought me back here to this old world to drink and decline,
Pretend that the search for another new world was well worth the burning of mine.
But sometimes at night, in my dreams, Comes the singing of some unheard tropical bird,
And I smile in my sleep, Thinking Annabel Lee's finally made it to the top of the world.
Yeah, sometimes at night in my dreams comes the singing of some unheard tropical bird,
And I smile in my sleep, thinking Annabel Lee's finally found another new world.

You know my dad he does his livin a little less mild
He'd rather sing those gospel songs on the

On the other side of where dad and I land
We laugh and joke and give him hell but he 
loves that little girl

It's a place where all of us fit in

As I have on Sunday morning
Brother john's there sipping his drink
He don't care what the others might think
He'll laugh and joke and finds it funny
That the others all drink alone at home

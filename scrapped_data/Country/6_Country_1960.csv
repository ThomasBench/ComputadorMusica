We never did before
Since we found out how it hurts
I bet we never quarrel any more
I'm back in baby's arms
How I missed those loving arms
I'm back where I  belong
Back in baby's arms
Thought I didn't need his love
'Til he took it away
Now I'm back where I belong
And in my baby's arms I'm gonna stay
I'm back in baby's arms
How I missed those loving arms
I'm back where I belong

The Germans had the biggest ship that had the biggest guns
On her decks were guns as big as steers and shells as big as trees
Out of the cold and foggy night came the British ship the Hood
And every British seaman he knew and understood
Stop those guns as big as steers and those shells as big as trees
We'll find the German battleship that's making such a fuss
We gotta sink the Bismarck cause the world depends on us
Yeah, hit the decks a running boys and spin those guns around
When we find the Bismarck we gotta cut her down
The Hood found the Bismarck and on that fatal day
The Bismarck started firing fifteen miles away
But when the smoke had cleared away the mighty Hood went down
For six long days and weary nights they tried to find her trail
Churchill told the people put every ship a-sail
We gotta sink the Bismarck to the bottom of the sea
We found that German battleship was makin' such a fuss
We had to sink the Bismarck 'cause the world depends on us
We hit the decks a-runnin' and we spun those guns around
Yeah, we found that mighty Bismarck and then we cut her down
The fog was gone the seventh day and they saw the morning sun
Ten hours away from homeland the Bismarck made its run
The Admiral of the British fleet said turn those bows around
We found that German battleship and we're gonna cut her down
The British guns were aimed and the shells were coming fast
The first shell hit the Bismarck, they knew she couldn't last
Sink the Bismark was the battle cry that shook the seven seas
We found that German battleship was makin' such a fuss
We had to sink the Bismarck 'cause the world depends on us
We hit the decks a-runnin' and we spun those guns around
Yeah, we found that mighty Bismarck and then we cut her down
We found that German battleship was makin' such a fuss

I lived on hopes that you'd return and that's how I got by
The agony of loneliness just got too much for me
I couldn't wait forever needing love so desperately
So I found new lips to kiss me new arms to hold me tight
I found new love and happiness to fill these empty nights

There's no stronger wind than the one that blows down a lonesome railroad line.

There's nothing that's as real as the love that's in my mind.
Close your eyes I'll be here in the mornin',
Close your eyes I'll be here for a while.
There's lots of things a-lookin' back I'd surely like to see.
I'd like to lean into the wind and tell myself I'm free
But your softest whispers louder than the highway's call to me
Close your eyes I'll be here in the mornin',
Close your eyes I'll be here for a while.
All the mountains and the rivers and the valleys can't compare
To your bluely dancin' eyes and yellow shinin' hair
I could never hit the open road and leave you lyin' there
Close your eyes I'll be here in the mornin',
Close your eyes I'll be here for a while.
Aw lay your head back easy love and close your cryin' eyes
I'll be layin' here beside you when the sun comes on the rise
And I'll stay as long as the cuckoo wails and the lonesome Blue Jay cries.
Close your eyes I'll be here in the mornin',
Close your eyes I'll be here for a while.

You're asking me where this call comes from

If your new romance turns out a failure
Here's where to find me my dear
I'm just on the blue side of lonesome
Right next to the heartbreak hotel
In a tavern that's known as Three Tear Drops
On a bar stool not doin' so well
The floor has a carpet of sorrow
But no one can weep in the aisle
And they say someone broke the bar mirror
With only the ghost of a smile
The hands on the clock never alter
For things never change in this place
There's no present, no past, no future
We're the ones who have lost in love's race
I'm just on the blue side of lonesome
Right next to the heartbreak hotel
In a tavern that's known as Three Tear Drops
On a bar stool not doin' so well

The moon's dancin' purple all through her black hair

And the sun will rise soon on the false and the fair
Sing a-too a-loor-a-lie-o
She tells me she comes from my mother the mountain
Her skin fits her tightly and her lips do not lie
She silently slips from her throat a medallion
Slowly she twirls it in front of my eyes
Sing a-too a-loor-a-lie-o
I watch her, I love her, I long for to touch her
The satin she's wearin' is shimmering blue
Outside my window her ladies are sleeping
My dog's a-gone hunting, the howling is through
Sing a-too a-loor-a-lie-o

And her hair turns to splinters and her flesh turns to brine
She leaps 'cross the room, she stands in the window
And screams that my first-born will surely be blind
Sing a-too a-loor-a-lie-o
Then she throws herself out to the black of the nightfall
She's parted her lips, but she makes not a sound
I fly down the stairway and I run to the garden
No trace of my true love is there to be found
Sing a-too a-loor-a-lie-o
So walk these hills lightly and watch who you're lovin'
By mother the mountain, I swear that it's true
And love not a woman with hair black as midnight
And a dress made of satin all shimmering blue
Sing a-too a-loor-a-lie-o

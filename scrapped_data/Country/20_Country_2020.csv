0,Stone Me (ver 2),Margo Price,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/margo-price/stone-me-chords-3249617,"Everybody wants to live in a glass house
I'd rather stay home 'cause when I go out
I wish I never did
Take me back home, when I was a kid
Sobriety is a hell of a drug
They say you only fight with the people you love
But I won't forget what it's like to be poor
I could be there again, baby that's for sure
Love me, hate me
Desecrate me
Call me a bitch then call me baby
You don't know me
You don't own me
Yeah that's no way to stone me
Yeah that's no way to stone me
You can pick a side but both are wrong
You can fight the good fight
but you're on your own
I used to feel loved but now I feel used
Almost went broke just from paying dues
Through the mud and rain you can drag my name
You can say I've spent my life in vain
But I won't be ashamed of what I am
For your judgement day I don't give a damn
Love me, hate me
Desecrate me
Call me a bitch then call me baby
You don't know me
You don't own me
Yeah that's no way to stone me
Yeah that's no way to stone me
Yeah that's no way to stone me
Yeah that's no way to stone me

You ain't got the heart to tell her
She'd be loaded up and shipped off
On that truck to you know where
And if you're gonna feed her
You might as well just breed her

Is another open mare
It's raining horses
We just may drown
In a flood of palominos, paints and
Grays and bays and browns
It's raining horses
It's coming down
Round here it ain't cats and dogs but
Colts that hit the ground
The forecast calls for foalin'
With zero chance of knowin
If the lead or if the weather's gonna
Change on down the line
The kids can't even ride her
Cause what if there inside her
Is the one that spins and slides and
Finally makes it all worthwhile
It's raining horses
We just may drown
In a flood of palominos, paints and
Grays and bays and browns
It's raining horses
It's coming down
Round here it ain't cats and dogs but
Colts that hit the ground
If I could only see into the future
And if a cloud with silver lining waited there
Well I wouldn't mind so much that it
Keeps pouring down these ponies
And I'd make sure I'm always where
It's raining horses

In a sea of palominos, paints and
Grays and bays and browns

Well, I think it's a little too late to be moving on
No one is a really to say, what's right, what's wrong
So let's just get through the day
Maybe a new way, to get more fists for the fight
Fight or flight, I recheck the meter but the meter was right
When the dance is done, still nobody wanna live in no paradise
At least you took the time to take the transcendental ticket to ride

Fell on your face and busted one eye up
You told a story about a boxing glove
And you're the Hemingway hero
A black-eyed James Dean in a one-man show

You get the glory, and I get the mess
You play the good guy and I'm the fool, I guess
You can't remember, and I can't forget

I was scrolling like hell to find a friend to call
Crying on the front lawn in flashing lights
I still see you on that stretcher in the back of my mind

You get the pity, and I'm just a wreck
I live with the memories, you get to push reset
You can’t remember, and I can’t forget
But I remember that 911 call
And picking you up from jail still drunk
Too many nights just watching you breathe
You aren't just killing yourself, now you’re killing me
Remember tonight when I told the truth
Just like these drugs, I'm bad for you
'Cause if I stay, you'll never ask for help
But if I go, you might save yourself
So I pray like hell that you’ll save yourself

Saying things in the morning that he can’t repeat
Dreams of death in a drowning epiphany
He starts to weep, singing
The sky explodes, the sea it roars, the crashing of the waves
The howling wind it stings his skin the blinding of the rain

Towed into the grey

Full of holes and marks

And you'll leave this place alive""

Lookin' for a love oh me oh my

Don't drink too much

Greetings from Tobacco Town, USA
Greetings from Tobacco Town, USA
I've been wandering these roads
Since I was 3 years old
Watching the men I thought were gods
Turning green leafs into gold
Now the fields they all lay empty
Curing barns are growing cold
All the while another cash crop
Just begging to be sold
Yeah, we got the infrastructure
Lord know's we got the will
But a solution to a problem
Doesn't pay that problem's bills
So they'll keep calling it illegal
Keep pumping us with pills
Tell Roosevelt what the Bible Belt
Went and did to his New Deal
We get low down
We get high as a kite
Lord I wish I may
Lord I wish I might
Be singing this song
When I hit the pearly gates
Greetings from Tobacco Town, USA
Greetings from Tobacco Town, USA
We could pay for oil
Coal and steel
If the factory work ain't left yet
Bet a dollar that it will
We redefined resilience
We'll make it somehow
But if God was going to save us, he'd have done it by now
If your god was going to save us, he'd have done it by now
We get low down
We get high as a kite
Lord I wish I may
Lord I wish I might
Be singing this song
When I hit the pearly gates

That I'd never make you regret
Choosing me to stand by your side
And I swear I had an honest plan
To make myself an honest man
But the ones best-laid often go awry
And I know good and well
That I'm goin' straight to hell
For all the things I put   you   through
Yes, my biggest regret in life
The thing that keeps me up at night
The day I learned how to lie to you
I've long set fire to things I love
Told myself I don't deserve
To ever have and hold that kind of glory
But I'll come back in a couple days
To search the ash and memory
And start paintin' my side of the story
And I know good and well
That I'm goin' straight to hell
For all the things I put   you   through
Yes, my biggest regret in life
The thing that keeps me up at night
The day I learned how to lie to you
For the lies, they started short and small
But then they grew up big and tall
Like that old oak tree out in our front yard
And without warning, late last May
A branch, it snapped and then gave way
It tumbled down and tore our home apart
Yeah, it tumbled down and tore right through your heart
And I lied when I told you I was different
And I lied when I told you I could change
Now I'm stuck in Kansas City
Wishing I could go back to
The day I learned how to lie to you
Oh, the day I learned how to lie to you
Ah, the day I learned how to lie to you

You were sitting alone
I came up for your order and asked you what you want
You said ""do you really wanna know?""
Just got to town I didn’t have a friend, no,
I didn't even have a car
Down at the three clubs I wrote you a poem
And you bought the drinks at the bar
Oh then you
Fell in love with me
Yes you did
You took me to A from Z
Yes you did
There was something you could see
I was broken, I was poor,
And you said I could be yours
Though I don't have a dime
Even bums get lucky sometimes
I have never been a hero
I can't pretend to  have a plan
No I just want to be a regular guy
Does that mean I could be your man
Not strong or fast, wasn’t good in school
Yes when I sing I’m flat or sharp
Then you took your aim at me
And you shot your arrow through my heart
Oh when you
Fell in love with me
Yes you did
You took me to A from Z
Yes you did
There was something you could see
Oh I found my key
We’re in perfect harmony

come on down and take a seat. We’ll put some John Prine on repeat,

with four flat tires and a smog check that’s never gonna pass.
  If you were a pair of socks, you’d be full of holes,
you’re one bad hombre, so, why don’t you just turn around and go home.
And maybe do something with that hair, take a walk in the park, visit a renaissance fair.
You’re headed for prison, you know, but don’t be scared, the first time is the hardest.

With some news no one ever wants to hear
It hit me like a punch, it took my breath
He was just gettin' into his best years
Yeah, somethin' like that'll shake you up
Wake you up
So I stopped off at a Texaco, bought a Slim Jim and a coke
Parked out by the water just to watch that river flow
Grabbed my guitar from the back seat, wrote a song just for me
And I sung it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees
I thought of home, grabbed my phone from my pocket
And I called mama
It rang a couple times, and she picked up
I can always hear her smile when I call
I just called to tell you that I loved you
I was missing you and dad and home, that's all
I got to really thinking this morning
About what's important
So I stopped off at a Texaco, bought a Slim Jim and a coke
Parked out by the water just to watch that river flow
Grabbed my guitar from the back seat, wrote a song just for me
And I sung it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees
I thought of home, grabbed my phone from my pocket
And I called mama
And from now on
I ain't gonna wait so long
To stop off at a Texaco, buy a Slim Jim and a coke
Park out by the water just to watch that river flow
Grab my guitar from the back seat, write a song just for me
Sing it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees
I think of home, grab my phone from my pocket
Instead of sayin' tomorrow, I'm gonna
And I called mama

48,Rivers Still Running,High Valley,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/high-valley/rivers-still-running-chords-3138965,"Got a couple barefoot
Blue jean kids on a rope swing
That grand daddy hung from the limb of an oak tree
Got the floor boards creakin' in our cabin in the woods
And that ole' truck needs a little bit of love underneath that hood
But baby it's all good
It's alright
Ain't worried bout nothin
Sun came up and the river's still runnin'
It's a good day to be here livin
Soakin up every single minute I'm given
I'm blessed ain't talkin' bout money
I'm rich when I'm holding you honey
Alright  Ain't worried bout nothin
Sun came up and the river's still runnin' (Alright)
Sun came up and the river's still runnin' (Alright)
You're the silver lining in a cloudy world
Everything's brighter when I'm with you girl
When I see you smile and I hear you pray
I got a pretty good feeling everything's gonna be OK
At the end of the day
It's alright
Ain't worried bout nothin
Sun came up and the river's still runnin'
It's a good day to be here livin
Soakin up every single minute I'm given
I'm blessed ain't talkin' bout money
I'm rich when I'm holding you honey
Alright  Ain't worried bout nothin
Sun came up and the river's still runnin' (Alright)
Sun came up and the river's still runnin' (Alright)
Even if the mailman fills that box with bills
And I burn them t-bones on the grill
If the breaker trips and the dryer fries
We'll hang them clothes out on the line

I'e been floating for so long from the shore
the sea it has its song that it's singing
it's a sad and lonely tune in the blue
and it calls to drifting sailors like me and you
but I cannot understand
why I'm longing for the land
I miss the sound of the breeze through the leaves of the sycamore
wading in the waves to my knees on a sandy shore
the birds and the bees and your panties on the bathroom floor
well I miss you more
I miss you more
The sea calls to me again like it's screaming
home is in the water in the stars
In the chasm of the deep they're feeding
on the changing aching cavern of my heart
though its her that is tearing us apart
I begin to understand
why I'm longing for the land
I miss the sound of the breeze through the leaves of the sycamore
wading in the waves to my knees on a sandy shore
the birds and the bees and your panties on the bathroom floor
well I miss you more
I miss you more

Midnight, I'm wound up tight
Slowly comin' down in the daytime
I been lyin' low from work,
hangin' over from the hurt from you babe
But I'm gonna suffer through the strain, till I get a
Better thing with you, Darlin', me and you.
So hard to see so far ahead
When I can't seem to drag myself out of bed
gotta find me a good man, a good man, a good man.Yeah.
You better stop, think about what you're saying
I was seriously dedicated, in the game of playin'
You made ten thousand promises you couldn’t keep
I forgave you when you lied, pleaded and weeped
Put up with your disrespect and neglect
What an experience, I'll never forget.
Till now, everything I did was wrong. (I'm sorry, baby)
Today you're free, but we live alone.
Gotta find me a good woman...Good woman...Good woman...Yeah.
It was twelve o'clock in the midnight hour
Gotta find a good woman

 The last one to know, the last one to show
 I was the last one you thought you'd see there
 And I saw the surprise and the fear in his eyes when I took his glass of champagne
 I toasted you, said honey we may be through but you'll never hear me complain
 'Cause I got friends in low places where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
  My blues away and I'll be okay
  I'm not big on social graces, think I'll slip on down to the oasis
  So I've got friends in low places
 Well I guess I was wrong I just don't belong but then, I've been there before
 Everything's alright I'll just say goodnight
 And I'll show myself to the door
 Hey I didn't mean to cause a big scene just give me an hour and then
 I'll be as high as that ivory tower that you’re livin’ in
 'Cause I got friends in low places where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
  My blues away and I'll be okay
  I'm not big on social graces, think I'll slip on down to the oasis

And if you look real close you'll see, our eyes are just the same
I never met them face to face but I still know them well
From the stories my dear grandmama   tells
Elijah was a farmer he knew how to make things grow
And Fanny vowed she'd follow him where ever he would go
As things turned out they never left their small Kentucky farm
But he kept her fed and she kept him warm
They're my guardian angels and I know they can see
Every step I take they are watching over me
I might not know where I'm going but I'm sure where I come from
They're my guardian angels,  and I'm their special one
Sometimes when I'm tired I feel Elijah take my arm
He says, ""People doing hard work never did a body harm""
And when I'm really troubled and I don't know what to do
Fanny whispers, ""Just do your best, we're awful proud of you""
They're my guardian angels and I know they can see
Every step I take they are watching over me
I might not know where I'm going but I'm sure where I come from

Why do you rope for short pay? 
You ain't gettin' nowhere 
And you're losin' your share 
Oh, you must've gone crazy out there

Never seen the spring hit the Great Divide

 Spend your life working it out

I'd get off and drink till daylight
Sleep the morning away
I had a plan to take my wages
Leave the rigs behind for good
But that life it is contagious
And it gets down in your blood
I lived in Corpus with my brother
We were always on the run
We were bad for one another
But we were good at having fun
We got stoned along the seawall
We got drunk and rolled a car
We knew the girls at every dancehall
Had a tab at every bar
If I could live my life all over
It wouldn't matter anyway
'Cause I never could stay sober
On the Corpus Christi Bay
My brother had a wife and family
You know he gave 'em a good home
But his wife thought we were crazy
And one day we found her gone
We threw here clothes into the car trunk
Her photographs her rosary
We went to the pier and got drunk
And threw it all into the sea

It wouldn't matter anyway
'Cause I never could stay sober

He married for the second time
He got a job with the union
And it's keeping him in line

He said he finally gave up drinkin'
Then he ordered me a beer

Never have drifted down a bayou stream

And I swore some day I was gonna go
Down Highway 10 past Lafayette
To Baton Rouge and I won't forget

A gulf storm blowing into town tonight
Living on the delta's quite a show
They got hurricane parties every time it blows
But here up north it's a cold, cold rain
And there ain't no cure for my blues today

Is a-coming into town, baby let's go down

You learned to swing with a do-si-do
But you learn to love at the fais-do-do

From too many people, too many machines.
And the time is upon us, today is forever,
Tomorrow is just one of yesterday’s dreams.

But I ain't got a nickel to my name
And everywhere I look I see temptation
She stands on every corner and calls my name
Now won't you tell me if you can
'Cause life's so hard to understand
Why's the rich man busy dancing
While the poor man pays the band
Oh they're billing me for killing me
Lord have mercy on the working man
Uncle Sam's got his hands in my pockets
And he helps himself each time he needs a dime
Them politicians treat me like a mushroom
'Cause they feed me bull and keep me in the blind
Now won't you tell me if you can
'Cause life's so hard to understand
Why's the rich man busy dancing
While the poor man pays the band
Oh they're billing me for killing me
Lord have mercy on the working man
Hey St. Peter look down for a minute
And see this little man about to drown
There's quicksand all around and man I'm in it
Please help me up Lord cause I'm going down
Now won't you tell me if you can
'Cause life's so hard to understand
Why's the rich man busy dancing
While the poor man pays the band
Oh they're billing me for killing me
Lord have mercy on the working man
Won't you tell me if you can
'Cause life's so hard to understand
Why's the fat man busy dancing
While the thin man pays the band
Oh they're billing me for killing me
Lord have mercy on the working man
Please Lord have mercy on the working man
Please Lord have mercy on the working man

 This thing called love, I must get around to it,
 I ain't ready...Crazy little thing called love.
 This thing called love, it cries in a cradle all night
 It swings, it jives, it shakes all over like a jellyfish
 I kinda like it....Crazy little thing called love.
 Well there goes my baby, well she knows how to rock and roll
 She drives me crazy...she gives me hot and cold fever
 And she leaves me in a cool, cool sweat.
 I gotta be cool, relax, get hip and get on my tracks
 Take a back seat, hitch hike. Take a long ride on my motorbike
 Until I'm ready....Crazy little thing called love.
 This thing called love, I just can't handle it
 This thing called love, I must get around to it,
 I ain't ready...Crazy little thing called love.

slavin on the fence line
stretchin those wires tight

and sweatin in the sunshine
but I get off tonight
I got a date with a girl
a pretty ranchers daughter
green eyes and golden hair
gonna pick her up at 8
after some soap and water
and we're headed
to the county fair
Well there's a full moon
in the western sky
and there's magic in the air
ain't nothin I know of
can make you fall in love
like a night at the
county fair
Well we walked
through the midway
lights and the laughter
little hand in mine
well she don't act
like she knows
what I'm after
but tonight
I'm gonna make her mine
tunnel of love
it ain't my style
on the ferris wheel
way up in the sky
with the stars in her eyes
gonna tell her
just how I feel
Well I know monday mornin
I'll be back on the fence line
But I'll be alright
cause that pretty little girl
said she's gonna
be all mine
and I'll take her out
next friday night

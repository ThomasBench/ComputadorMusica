i'm breathing deeper than I've ever done,
and it sure feels good, to finally feel the way i do,
I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you
And i'm lettin' go of all my lonely yesterdays,
I've forgiven myself for the mistakes I've made,
now there's just one thing, the only thing i wanna do,
i wanna love somebody, love somebody like you.
Yeah, I wanna feel the sunshine, Shinin' down on me and you,
when you put your arms around me, 
you let me know there's nothing in this world i cant do oo oo oo oo
I used to run in circles goin' nowhere fast,
i'd take one step forward and a two steps back
I couldn't walk a straight line even if i wanted to,
I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you
Yeah, I wanna feel the sunshine, Shinin' down on me and you,
when you put your arms around me, 
you let me know there's nothing in this world i cant do oo oo oo oo
Sometimes its hard for me to understand, 
but you're teachin' me to be better man,
I don't wanna take this life for granted like i used to do, no,no 
i wanna love somebody, love somebody like you,
i'm ready to love somebody, love somebody like you
And i wanna love somebody, love some body like you, yeah
I wanna be the man in the middle of the night,
shinin' like its true, I wanna be the man that you run to,
whenever i call on you, when everything that loved someone finally found it's way,
and i wanna be a better man,i see it in you yeah,yeah,yeah

3,The Storm,Garth Brooks,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/garth-brooks/the-storm-chords-2316171,"She sits among the pieces of broken glass and photographs
Reluctantly releases the last of what was her past
It struck without warning or did she just ignore the signs
In those dark clouds forming behind those silver lines
The door it slammed like thunder and the tears they fell like rain
And the warnings from her family whirl like a hurricane
She's drowning in emotions and she cannot reach the shore
She's alive but can she survive the storm
A broken jewel box dancer lies in pieces down the hall
She's finding out the answers don't change nothing at all
It's time she stopped searching for who's to blame or what went wrong
The only thing for certain is he's gone, she's got to move on
The door it slammed like thunder and the tears they fell like rain
And the warnings from her family whirl like a hurricane
She's drowning in emotions and she cannot reach the shore
She's alive but can she survive the storm
Someday days just roll on by without a gray cloud in the sky
She keeps telling herself, ""I will make it on my own""
And her friends they've all gone back to their lives
Thinking she will be all right
As she races through the night to make it home
The door it slammed like thunder and the tears they fell like rain
And the warnings from her family whirl like a hurricane
She's drowning in emotions and she cannot reach the shore
She's alive but can she survive the storm

""Don't let this fading summer pass you by""
""Don't let this fading summer pass you by""
Black hands held so high, the vulture wheels and dives
Something on the thermals yanked his chain
Smelled your boring apex rotting on the train tracks
He laughed under his breath because you thought that you could outrun...
Sorrow,   take your own advice
This thundering and lightning gets you rain
You run an airtight mission, a Cousteau expedition
To find a diamond at the bottom of the drain
A diamond at the bottom of the drain
Mockingbird sings     in the middle of the night
All his songs are stolen so he hides
He stole them out from whippoorwills
And screaming car alarms
  He sings them for you special
  He knows you're afraid of the dark
  Come on sorrow,   take your own advice
  Hide under the bed,   turn out the light
The stars this night in the sky are ringing out
You can almost hear them saying
""Close your eyes now kid""
""Close your eyes now kid""
Morning's teeth are lit
They are waiting
Waiting

Be a lover to their mother, and everything to everyone.

Yeah I'm dressed up for success, from my head down to my boots.
I don't do it for the money, there's bills that I can't pay.
I don't do it for the glory, I just do it anyway.
Providing for our futures, my responsibility.
Yeah I'm real good under pressure, being all that I can be.
I can't call in sick on Monday when the weekend's been too strong.
I just work straight through the holidays, sometimes all night long.
And you can bet that I stand ready, when the wolf growls at the door.
Hey I'm solid. Hey I'm steady. Hey I'm true down to the core.
And I will always do my duty no matter what the price.
I've counted up the cost, I know the sacrifice.
Oh, and I don't want to die for you, but if dying's asked of me.
I'll bear that cross with honor, 'cause freedom don't come free.

Stepping out, everyone can see my face
All the things I can’t erase
From my life, Everybody knows
Standing out, so you won’t forget my name

Sat down at a booth in a cafe there, gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair
He's a little shy so she gives him a smile and he said would you mind
Sittin down for a while and talking to me, I'm feeling a little low
She said I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go
So they went down and they sat on the pier he said ""I bet you got a boyfriend but I don't care
I've got no one to send a letter to.  Would you mind if I sent one back here
to you?""

Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waitin for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letters said, a soldiers coming home
So the letters came from an army camp, in California then Vietnam
And he told her of his heart, might be lovin all of things he was so scared of
He said when things were getting kinda rough over here, I think of that day
Sittin down at the pier and I close my eyes and see your pretty smile
Don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waitin for the love of a travelin' soldier

Waitin' for the soldier to come back again

sang a man said folks would you bow your head for a list of local Vietnam dead
Cryin all alone under the stands was a piccolo player in the marching band
And one name read and nobody really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair

Pounding brain
My last transmission down the drain
But the master of disaster     Gets tangled in his telecaster
He can't play it any faster     When he plays the blues
When he had the heart to ask her     And every note just shook the plaster
Now he's just a mean old bastard      When he plays the blues
There's a debt I owe
I'll never pay before I go
So I sing the blues
Hand me down my walking shoes
You're in my heart
Though we may be miles apart
There's my point
I'll see you in another joint
But the master of disaster     Gets tangled in his telecaster
He can't play it any faster     When he plays the blues
When he had the heart to ask her     And every note just shook the plaster
Now he's just a mean old bastard      When he plays the blues
Now he's just a mean old bastard      When he plays the blues

And you took my heart and turned your back on me

And you hit the bottle hard
And you race round in your fancy  cars
And you blow all your money
In brothel's beds and bars

You're broke and times are hard

 It’s getting cold 
 I’ve got my big coat on 
 I hear your laugh 
 And look up smiling at you 
 I run and run 
 Past the pumpkin patch 
 And the tractor rides up now 
 The sky is gold 
 I hug your legs and fall asleep 
 On the way home
 I don’t know why all the trees change in the fall
 I know you’re not scared of anything at all 
 Don’t know if Snow White’s house is near or far away 
But I know I had the best day with you today 
 I’m thirteen now
 And don’t know how my friends 
 Could be so mean 
 I come home crying 
 And you hold me tight 
 And grab the keys 
 And we drive and drive 
 Until we’ve found a town 
 Far enough away 
 And we talk and window-shop 
 Until I’ve forgotten all their names 
 I don’t know who I’m gonna talk to now at school 
 I know I’m laughing on the car ride home with you 
 Don’t know how long it’s gonna take to feel okay 
 But I know I had the best day with you today 
 I have an excellent father 
 His strength is making me stronger 
 God smiles on my little brother 
 Inside and out he’s better than I am 
 I grew up in a pretty house 
 And I had space to run 
 And I had the best days with you 
 There is a video 
 I found from back when I was three 
 You set up a paint set in the kitchen 
 And you’re talking to me 
 It’s the edge of princesses and pirate ships 
 And the seven dwarves 
 Daddy’s smart and you're the prettiest lady
 In the whole wide world 
 Now I know why all the trees change in the fall 
 I know you were on my side even when I was wrong 
 And I love you for giving me your eyes 
 Staying back and watching me shine 
 And I didn’t know if you knew 
 So I’m taking this chance to say 
 That I had the best day with you today

I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there, on a balcony in summer air
See the lights; see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello, little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
begging you, ""Please don't go...""
And I said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes... escape this town for a little while, o, Oh.
Cause you were Romeo - I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said ""stay away from Juliet"" 
but you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go""
And I said
Romeo take me somewhere, we can be alone
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes
Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes
Oh, Oh.
I got tired of waiting
  Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting, for you but you never come
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad -- go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby just say... yes
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh.

42,Red Dirt Girl,Emmylou Harris,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/emmylou-harris/red-dirt-girl-chords-956534,"Me and my best friend Lillian
And her blue tick hound dog Gideon
Sittin' in the front porch' coolin' in the shade
Singin' every song the radio played
Waitin' for the Alabama sun to go down
Two red dirt girls in a red dirt town
Me and Lillian
Just across the line and a little southeast of Meridian
She loved her brother I remember back when
He was fixin' up a '49 Indian
He told her ""Little sister, gonna ride the wind
Up around the moon and back again""
He never got farther than Vietnam
I was standin' there with her when the telegram come
For Lillian
Now he's lyin' somewhere about a million miles from Meridian
She said ""There's not much hope for a red dirt girl
Somewhere out there is a great big world,
that's where I'm bound
And the stars might fall on Alabama, but one of these days
I'm gonna swing my hammer down
Away from this red dirt town
I'm gonna make a joyful sound""
She grew up tall and she grew up thin
Buried that old dog Gideon
By a crepe myrtle bush at the back of the yard
Her daddy turned mean and her mama leaned hard
Got in trouble with a boy from town
Figured that she might as well settle down
So she dug right in
Across a red dirt line just a little southeast of Meridian
She tried hard to love him but it never did take
It was just another way for a heart to break
So she learned to bend
But one thing they don't tell you 'bout the blues when you got Îem
You keep on fallin' 'cause there ain't no bottom
There ain't no end, at least not for Lillian
Nobody knows when she started her skid
She was only 27 and she had 5 kids
Coulda' been the whiskey, coulda been the pills
Coulda been the dream she was tryin' to kill
But there won't be a mention in the news of the world
About the life and the death of a red dirt girl named Lillian
Who never got any farther across the line than Meridian
Now the stars still fall on Alabama
Tonight she finally laid that hammer down
Without a sound, in the red dirt ground

No matter where you wander, No matter what you do
Come what may I will walk with you.
I will walk with you. And treasure every smile
No matter what the fashion. You’ll always be my style.
My pretty little princess. An angel dressed in blue.
Come what may I will walk with you.
I will walk with you. Even if the sun don’t shine.
The rain it may come down. And fate may be unkind.
If you get a scrape. I’ll brush away the tears.
Come what may I will walk with you.
I will walk with you. Together we will share.
Jelly beans and pink ice cream. A Christmas teddy bear.
And one day I am certain a brand new puppy too.
Come what may I will walk with you. 
I will walk with you. And love you for all time.
Travel this ol’ world, your little hand in mine
I’ll never be far from you, this I promise too.

Seems like everything I do just turns out wrong
Why don't you come on out and despise me
So I could pack my bag and baby I'd be gone
Remember when you used to call me honey
I'd turn around and call you honey too
You might think it's a joke, but it ain't funny
To hurt someone who's so in love with you
A clown puts his makeup on upside down
So he wears a smile even when he wears a frown
You might think I'm here when you put me down
But actually I'm on the other side of town.
My body's in this room with you just catching hell
While my soul is drinking beer down the road a spell
You might think I'm listening to your grocery list
But I'm leaning on the jukebox and I'm about half ... way there
A clown puts his makeup on upside down
So he wears a smile even when he wears a frown
You might think I'm here when you put me down
But actually I'm on the other side of town.
I'm sittin' on a chair just behind my ear
Playing dominoes and drinking some ice cold beer
When you get done talking I'll come back downstairs
And assume the body of the person you presume who cares
A clown puts his makeup on upside down
So he wears a smile even when he wears a frown
You might think I'm here when you put me down
But actually I'm on the other side of town.
I'm across the river on the other side of town
In my mind I'm going to the dog-racing side of town

Plastic cap on my hair
I used to mind, now I don't care
I used to mind, now I don't care 'cause I'm gray
Did I show you this picture of my nephew?
Taken at his big birthday surprise
At my sister's house last Sunday
This is Monday and we're making pies
I'm making pies, making pies, I-hi hi
Thursday nights I go and type
Down the church with father Mike
It gets me out and he ain't hard to like at all
Jesus stares at me in my chair with his
Big blue eyes and his honey brown hair and he's
Looking at me way up there on the wall
Did I show you this picture of my sweetheart?
Taken of us before the war
Of the Greek and his Italian girl
One Sunday at the shore
We tied our ribbons to the fire escape
They were taken by the birds
Who flew home to the country
As the bombs rained on the world
5 a.m. here I am
Walking the block to Table Talk
You could cry or die or just make pies all day

He's off to slay some demon or dragonfly
And he looked at me, that long last time
Turned away again and I waved goodbye
In an envelope, inside his coat
Is a chain I wore, around my throat
Along with, a note I wrote
Said ""I love you but, I don't ... even know why""
But darling, I wish you well
On your way to the wishing well
Swinging off of those gates of hell
But I can tell how hard you're trying
Just have that secret hope
sometimes all we do is cope
Somewhere on the steepest slope
There'll be an endless rope
and nobody crying.
Well a long night turns into a couple long years
Of me walkin' around, around this trail of tears
Where the very loud voices of my own fears
Is ringin' and ringin' in my ears
It says that love is long gone
Every move I make is all wrong
Says you never gave a damn for me
For anything, for anyone
But darling, I wish you well
On your way to the wishing well
Swinging off of those gates of hell
But I can tell how hard you're trying
Just have that secret hope
sometimes all we do is cope
Somewhere on the steepest slope
There'll be an endless rope
and nobody crying.
May you dream you are dreaming, in a warm soft bed
And may the voices inside you that fill you with dread
Make the sound of thousands of angels instead
Tonight where you might be laying your head
But darling, I wish you well
On your way to the wishing well
Swinging off of those gates of hell
But I can tell how hard you're trying
Just have that secret hope
sometimes all we do is cope
Somewhere on the steepest slope
There'll be an endless rope

0,Im Looking For A World,Skeeter Davis,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/skeeter-davis/im-looking-for-a-world-chords-4117960,"A paper pack of sugar
A plastic spoon and knife
A paper cup a paper plate
A different boy each night
I'm getting ti-ired
    Of a paper and a plastic world
One that's not a lasting world
That's how I feel
   I'm looking for
   A silver and a crystal world
Not an artificial world
   But one that's real
        Shiny plastic flowers, (Shiny plastic flowers)
Electronic steeple chimes,(Electronic steeple chimes)
Seem to be becoming, (Seem to be becoming)
The symbols of our times
  I'm looking for    what I’m looking for
   a simple, a simple sandy suntan world
    Not a handy sun, not a handy sunlamp world
    But one that is true
   (I'm searching for)
    The kind and honest joy
    That I'll find in a boy
    Li-ike you

They rode to the Madre Sierra

In the glow of a soft candle light

You can hear them as they answer
To that roll call in the sky
Colonel Travis, Davy Crockett, and a hundred eighty more
Captain Dickenson, Jim Bowie
Present and accounted for
Back in 1836, Houston said to Travis
“Get some volunteers and go
Fortify the Alamo”
Well the men came from Texas
And from old Tennessee 
And they joined up with Travis
Just to fight for the right to be free.
Indian scouts with squirrel guns
Men with muzzle-loaders
Stood together, heel and toe
To defend the Alamo.
“You may ne'er see your loved ones,”
Travis told them that day
“Those who want to can leave now
Those who fight to the death let 'em stay.”
In the sand he drew a line
With his army sabre
Out of a hundred eighty five
Not a soldier crossed the line
With his banners a-dancin'
In the dawns' golden light
Santa Anna came prancing
On a horse that was black as the night.
Sent an officer to tell
Travis to surrender
Travis answered with a shell
And a rousing rebel yell
Santa Anna turned scarlet
“Play dugello!” he roared
“I will show them no quarter
Every one will be put to the sword!”
One hundred and eighty five
Holding back five thousand
Five days, six days, eight days, ten
Travis held and held again
Then he sent for replacements
For his wounded and lame
But the troops that were coming
Never came, never came, never came...
Twice he charged and blew recall
On the fatal third time
Santa Anna breached the wall
And he killed 'em all, one and all
Now the bugles are silent
And there's rust on each sword
And the small band of soldiers...
Lie asleep in the arms of the Lord...
In the southern part of Texas
Near the town of San Antone
Like a statue on his pinto rides a cowboy all alone
And he sees the cattle grazing where a century before
Santa Anna's guns were blazing and the cannons used to roar 
And his eyes turn sorta misty
And his heart begins to glow
And he takes his hat off slowly...
To the men of the Alamo
To the thirteen days of glory
At the siege of Alamo...

And the sound of thunder is spookin' The herd

Their bellows strike fear in my heart
I know if the storm lasts very much longer
There's bound to be a stampede

And the storm is lingering still
The lightning's glare on the restless herd
Make it seem like a sea's angry swell
Then all of a sudden a bolt of fire
Strikes the tree where my pony stands
As I fall to the ground I can hear the sound
Of a drover yellin' stampede
Stampede (Stampede!) cry stampede (Cry Stampede)
The thing that a cowboy fears the most is stampede
For a moment I lay in the mud half dazed
I could hear the herd bearin' down
And I crawled in a ditch where a tree came to rest
And I crouched between it and the ground
It seems like a miracle of God's hand
It's over and I'm still alive
And I thank the trail boss up in the sky
For sparin' me from the stampede
Stampede (Stampede!) cry stampede (Cry Stampede)

As he struggles with an old dream all night long
And when she awakes, she turns to reassure him
She whispers to a shadows and finds him gone
Way out in the barn a single lamp is burning
She faintly hears a radio play a sad old cowboy song
She watches as he works, with his riggins and his saddle
A sudden chill runs through her in the still of the not quite dawn
She's losing him, to the rodeo wind
That blows through his soul, when the summer begins
When the winter snow falls, he'll come back again
But his heart always drifts, on the rodeo wind
One sure way to lose him
Is to try and make him stay
He can't explain he don't even know himself
But the force that drew her to him
Has just gotta break away
And the sound of the road and the rolling wheel
Is the only thing that helps
She's losing him, to the rodeo wind
That blows through his soul, when the summer begins
When the winter snow falls, he'll come back again
But his heart always drifts, on the rodeo wind
Now it all makes sense, those signs she's been seeing all along
She feels like such a fool, a woman ought to know
Just the other day, she saw him sittin' out on the south fence
Throwing stones at prairie dogs, and staring down the road

When the winter snow falls, he'll come back again

The old house is still standing, though the paint is cracked and dry,
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk and with my sweet Mary,
hair of gold and lips like cherries.
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.
And then suddenly I awake and look around me
at the four gray walls that surround me
and I realize that I was only dreaming.
For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak
again I'll touch the green, green grass of home
Yes, they'll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree;
As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home.

47,Man With Money,The Everly Brothers,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-everly-brothers/man-with-money-chords-1750998,"She wants a man with lots of money, and 
He buys her things, she calls him honey, 
she calls me poor boy.
What good does it do to give her love 
good and true?
When any fool would understand, she thinks 
money makes a man.
She wants a man with lots of money, and 
She wants the things you buy with money 
and not a poor boy..a man with money, a
man with money, a man with money.
Just down the street, I know a place, when 
they're asleep, I'll cover my face,
I'll break the lock, open the door,
I'll slip inside, I'll rob the store.
Then I'll be a man with lots of money and 
I'll buy her things, she'll call me honey 
and not a poor boy.
A man with money..a man with money..a man 
with money..a man with money..a man with 
money....(Fade.)

of light.
She look at you once in a day that's all 
wrong looks all right.
And I love her, God knows, I love her.
Kentucky woman......if she get to know you.
She gots to own you......Kentucky woman.
She's not the kind that gets turned at the 
drop of her name.
But something inside that she's got turns 
you on just the same.
And she loves me, God knows, she loves me.
Kentucky woman......if she get to know you.
She gots to own you......Kentucky woman.
Don't want much, the good Lord's earth 
That one girl, and life is sweet and good,

49,You Kept Me Awake Last Night,Jim Reeves,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jim-reeves/you-kept-me-awake-last-night-chords-3850448,"You kept me awake last night
Thought about you, 'til broad daylight
If you ask me, it just ain't right
This keepin' me awake, at night
How you expect, a poor guy to last
With nothin', but a lonesome past
Though you're gone, you're never out of sight
You kept me awake last night
I was foolin' myself, by goin' to bed
'Cause I saw your face, in the book that I read
I hugged my pillow and whispered sleep tight
But you kept me awake last night
When twilight came, I said goodbye to the sun
Then thought about, all those sweet things you done
And I know the same thing, will happen tonight
You kept me awake, last night

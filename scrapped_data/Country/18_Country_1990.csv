0,Please Come To Boston,Reba McEntire,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/reba-mcentire/please-come-to-boston-chords-1815601,"He said, ""Please come to Boston for the springtime
I'm staying here with some friends and they've got lots of room
You can sell your paintings on the sidewalk
By a cafe where I hope to be working soon
Please come to Boston""
I said ""No
Boy, would you come home to me.""
I said, ""Rambling boy, why don't ya settle down?
Boston ain't your kind of town
There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan of a man from Tennessee
He said, ""Please come to Denver, where the snow falls
We'll move up into the mountains so far, we can't be found
And throw ""I love you"" echoes down on the canyon
And then lie awake at night until they come back around
Please come to Denver
I just said ""No
Boy, won't you come home to me.""
And I said, ""Rambling boy, why don't you settle down?
Denver ain't your kind of town
There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan of a man from Tennessee
Now that drifter's world goes 'round and 'round,
And I doubt if it's ever gonna stop
But of all the dreams he's lost or found
And all that I ain't got
He still needs to lean into
Somebody he can sing to
He said, ""Please come to L.A. to live forever
The California life alone is just too hard to bear
I live in a house that looks out over the ocean
And there's some stars that fell from the sky, living up on the hill
Please come to L.A.""
I just said ""No
Boy, won't you come home to me.""
And I said, ""Rambling boy, why don't you settle down?
L.A. can't be your kind of town
There ain't no gold and there ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan of a man from Tennessee
I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee___

1,Some Gave All,Billy Ray Cyrus,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/billy-ray-cyrus/some-gave-all-chords-65438,"I knew a man called him Sandy Cane
Few folks even knew his name
But a hero yes was he
He left a boy, came back a man
Still many just don't understand
About the reasons we are free
I can't forget the look in his eyes
Or the tears he cried
As he said these words to me
All gave some, some gave all
Some stood through for the red, white and blue and some had to fall
And if you ever think of me
Think of all your liberties and recall
Some gave all
Now Sandy Cane is no longer here
But his words are oh so clear
As they echo throughout our land
For all his friends who gave us all
Who stood the ground and took the fall
To help their fellow man
Love your country, live with pride
And don't forget those who died
America can't you see?
All gave some, some gave all
Some stood through for the red, white and blue and some had to fall
And if you ever think of me
Think of all your liberties and recall
Some gave all

 He said don't look surprised old man I'm older than you think
 If I was the talkin' kind I could tell you a thing or two
 And since you didn't ask, let me show you my tattoos
 He said I got this rose in Memphis in some back old alley dump
 Picked this eagle up in Dallas, man I sure was good and drunk
 And you know the way I see it, if it gets any worse out there
 A guy like me hasn't got a prayer
 The old man poured some coffee, he said this one's on me
 Sat down his cigarette and rolled up his sleeve
 Take a good look here my friend, you see what these are
 Just my ragged old and jagged ordinary scars
 He said I got this one in Paris in a war 'fore you were born
 And this one when I was half your age workin' on my daddy's farm
 And you know the way I see it, son you ain't seen what I've seen
 Cause tattoos and scars are different things
 He said I've been here for all these years, and what I know is this
 If you look and listen close, a man will show you what he is
 You know the way I see it, you've been 'round but you're still green
 Cause tattoos and scars are different things
 A young kid stepped in from the cold, he ordered up a drink
 He said don't look surprised old man I'm older than you think

3,Blow You Away,Robert Earl Keen,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/robert-earl-keen/blow-you-away-chords-2097643,"You take off from work a bit early,
The boss doesn't care if you stay.
The guard with the key has to check your ID,
But he'd just as soon blow you away.
The cops have stopped ten miles of traffic,
They're sorry for all the delay.
No need for alarm as they're waving their arms,
But they'd just as soon blow you away.
Two pretty blondes in a Porsche,
Their bumper says 'We Love L.A.'
They look pretty fair but they're crazy out there,
They'd just as soon blow you away.
You got in some trouble in high school,
But you feel like a new man today.
You keep to yourself because anyone else.
Would just as soon blow you away.
You're standin' in front of the teller,
She's countin' out all of your pay.
There's twenties and ones and there's guards with their guns,
And they'd just as soon blow you away.
And one old ex-con at the station,
Fixes flats in the back of the bay.
He winks and he jokes and he borrows a smoke,
But he'd just as soon blow you away.
You like the new girl at the hotel,
She drops your room key in the tray.
No words will pass through the bullet-proof glass,
'Cause she'd just as soon blow you away.
You climb up the stairs every evening,
To your room right above the cafe.
There ain't much mystique but you pay every week,
Cause they'd just as soon blow you away.
And you turn out the light that you read by,
You pray that you're one of the few.
When you're in with the Lord there's just one reward,
And they'd just as soon make it come true.
The mattress is mildewed and lumpy,
But you fall fast asleep where you lay.
Under the lump there's a twenty gauge pump,
Cause they'd just as soon blow you away.

Leavin' nobody to sing his sad song
Leavin' nobody to carry him home
He was only a hobo, but one more is gone

And I wish I could have told the bride and groom
Just what I think of marriage
What's in store after the honeymoon
About how men and women ought to live apart
How a promise never made could not be broken 
And would never break a heart
This little girl came spinning across the floor
Her crinolines were billowing
Beneath the skirt of calico she wore
Each one of them was drawn into her dream
And they laughed and stamped and clapped their hands 
And hollered at her dance little Jean
They said dance little Jean this day is for you
Two people that you love stood up to say I do
Dance little Jean the prayer that you had was answered today
Your Momma's marrying your dad
As I figured what this get together meant
And how it ended years of tears 
And sad confusions that the little girl had spent
About the time the couple cut the cake
But we stayed and we played all night long 
For love and laughs and little Jeanie's sake
We played dance little Jean this day is for you
Two people that you love stood up to say I do
Dance little Jean the prayer that you had was answered today

From the dirty old mess hall
You march to the brick wall,
And too tired to sing.
And, it's all afternoon
You remember your home town
All In-side the walls,
The walls of Red Wing.
Oh, the gates are cast iron
And the walls are barbed wire.
With the 'lec-tri-city sting.
And it's keep down your head
And stay in your number,
All Inside the grounds,
Of the walls of Red Wing.
Oh, it's fare thee well
To the deep hollow dungeon,
That takes you to  screen.
farewell to the minutes
They threaten you with it,
All In-side the grounds,
Of the walls of Red Wing.
It's many a_  guard
That stands around smilin',
Like he was a king.
Hopin' to get you
Behind the wood pilin',
All In-side the grounds,
Of the walls of Red Wing.
The night aimed shadows
Through the crossbar windows,
To make the wall-siding sing.
It's many a night
I pretended to be a-sleepin',
All In-side the grounds,
Of the walls of Red Wing.
As the rain rattled heavy
On the bunk-house shingles,
They made my ears ring.
'Til the keys of the guards
Clicked the tune of the morning,
All Ins-ide the grounds,
Of the walls of Red Wing.
Oh, some of us'll will up
In St. Cloud Prison,
To be lawyers and things,
And some of us'll stand up
To meet you on your crossroads,
From In-side the grounds,
Of the walls of Red Wing.

Stuck between some letters and some keys

In the ache of old good-byes

There he did meet young Sarah McCray
That wild rose of morning, that pale flower dawning,
Herald of springtime in his young life that day.

That lie to the north of New Mexico.
He was overheard to say he was lookin' for Billy Grey,
   A ruthless man and a dangerous outlaw.
The deadly news came creeping, while Billy lie sleeping,
There in the Claredon Bar and Hotel.
He fled toward the old church, there on the outskirts,
Thinking he'd climb that old steeple bell.
A rifle ball came flying, face down he lay dying,
There in the dust of the road where he fell.
Sarah she ran to him, cursing the lawman,
Accepting no reason, just knowing he was killed.

Of each day of sorrow the long years had sown.
Written on a stone where the dusty winds had long blown,
Eighteen words to a passing world say:
""True love knows no season, no rhyme nor no reason,
Justice is cold as the Grainger county clay.""

She was so young and fair
A voice like spring rain fallin' down and sunlight in her hair
I'd never seen her face before so I asked all around
Her daddy owns a grocery store and she lives in Bristol town
Carrie darlin' Carrie Carrie Brown I cry
If I can't marry Carrie Brown believe I'd rather die
I laid my last ten dollars down
Though I didn't need a thing
Just to touch sweet Carrie Brown
When she handed me my change
I hung around 'till closin' time I scarce believed my eyes
My darlin' walkin' arm in arm
With a boy named Billy Wise
Carrie darling Carrie , Carrie Brown I cry
If I can't marry Carrie Brown,I believe I'd rather die
I walked around in Bristol town a bitter broken man
A heart that pined for Carrie Brown and a pistol in my hand
We met again on State Street poor Billy Wise and me
I shot him in Virginia and he died in Tennessee
Carrie Darling Carrie , Carrie Brown I cry
If I can't marry Carrie Brown , I believe I'd rather die
Now I'm down in the Bristol jail and all I do is cry
'Cause the jury found me guilty and the judge says I must die
I'm just a poor young mountain boy
Ain't never been to town
And I've come to ruination for the love of Carrie Brown

Losing not an ounce of what
You see in me, my lamb
If you're not with me tomorrow
That would be the worst
I'm glad I dream of what I dream of
Today a thing was burst
O all around
O all around
It's kept together moving all around
O all around
O all around
It's kept together moving all around
My brain it beams, it's here at all
And living, I must work
To make our lives here justified
And not let trouble lurk
Instead of seeing monkeys biting
I lay on the ground
While my hectic travelling partner
Wandered all around
O all around
O all around
It's kept together moving all around
O all around
O all around
It's kept together moving all around
O all around a left buttock
And all around a right
All around your every curve
I hope to go tonight
But only hold me, hold me
All the city's on me
And all they wish to scold me
And lay their hands upon me
So only hold me, hold me
And I'll return your baby
I just need an evening
With someone nice to hide me

And I cannot get close to thee
Our life is ruled by enmity
And I can't weaken that
The only way that I can see
Is to hold you close to me
To love you for it's meant to be
I weaken your attack
Everything was lucked and downy
What was good was up from under
Until black, that awful tender
Came and popped my sense of wonder
All at once all eyes turned at him
Leaving me an unwatched body
And it sagged, my body's rib cage
Out from under ogler's study
Black was decomposing quickly
This was found offensive to me
His disrespect for life's proprieties
Made me scared he would destroy me
Black, you are my enemy
And I cannot get close to thee
Our life is ruled by enmity
And I can't weaken that
The only way that I can see
Is to hold you close to me
To love you for it's meant to be
I weaken your attack
So I thought I'd try to cut him
Try to force him 'neath my level
The only way to equal to him
Would be hit him with a shovel
But to really rise above him
That would be the final evil
So instead I asked the sucker
If he'd care to see my rooms
And as a friend and as a comrade
And all the things that these implied
I made him leave what it was that he had
Used to keep us unallied
Black, you are my enemy
And I cannot get close to thee
Our life is ruled by enmity
And I can't weaken that
The only way that I can see
Is to hold you close to me
To love you for it's meant to be
I weaken your attack 
Now black and I we are together
Fairly just inseparable
And in the terriblest of weather
Our bonds are incorruptible
Black, you are my enemy
And I cannot get close to thee
Our life is ruled by enmity
And I can't weaken that
The only way that I can see
Is to hold you close to me

And when I reached Jamaica
I made a stop

And the dancing girls swing to and fro

And the rum is good any time of year

0,The Class Of 57,The Statler Brothers,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-statler-brothers/the-class-of-57-chords-636058,"Tommy's selling used cars, Nancy's fixing hair,
Harvey runs a grocery store and Margaret doesn't care.
Jerry drives a truck for Sears and Charlotte's on the make,
And Paul sells life insurance and part time real estate.
Helen is a hostess, Frank works at the mill,
Janet teaches grade school and probably always will.
Bob works for the city and Jack's in lab research,
And Peggy plays organ at the Presbyterian Church.
And the class of '57 had its dreams,
Oh, we all thought we'd change the world with our great works and deeds.
Or maybe we just thought the world would change to fit our needs,
The class of '57 had its dreams.
Betty runs a trailer park, Jan sells Tupperware,
Randy's on an insane ward, Mary's on welfare.
Charlie took a job with Ford, Joe took Freddie's wife,
Charlotte took a millionaire, and Freddie took his life.
John is big in cattle, Ray is deep in debt,
Where Mavis finally wound up is anybody's bet.
Linda married Sonny, Brenda married me,
And the class of all of us is just a part of history.

They'd rather give you a song
Than diamonds or gold

And each night begins a new day

Grow up to be cowboys

Let 'em be doctors

Little warm puppies and children
And girls of the night

Gimme a little a little charm that'll make me rich
Gimme a million dollars and I tell you what I'll do
This very night I'm gonna marry you

Made a million dollars and she put it in his hand
Then she giggled and she wiggled and she said hey hey
I'm getting ready for my wedding day
But old handsome Jack he said goodbye Marie
You're too damned ugly for a rich man like me
Then Marie started mumbling her fangs started gnashing
Her body started trembling and her eyes started flashing

A soft white floating cloud sailing across the sky of blue
A yellow dandelion pretty evergreen
And some red and orange flowers growing wild along the stream

The blackness in a stormy sky the brown in fallen leaves
And the multicolored rainbow stretched across the sky
And the purple haze at sunset just before the night

The more I realize that I was viewing God's coloring book

Remember the night you blowed Sadie down?""

First degree and the second degree 
Got any papers would you read 'em to me

Sent me back to the county jail

Heaven  should be proud.
  The fifties left town on a crowded dance floor.
  The sixties came in with a bang and a roar.
  The world heard a knock  it was Janice at the door;
  They let her in.
  And when it seemed this whole world was falling apart,
  The houselights would fall and the  music would start.
  She'd be givin¡¯ us all a piece of her heart,
  Once again.
But it¡¯s all right now.
Keep on  singin' loud.
It¡¯s all right now.
Heaven  should be proud.
  It was October in  St. Louis town,
  When we heard that the Free Bird had  fell to the ground;
  We all said a prayer before we went down,
  To play.
  And Ronnie, my buddy,   above all the rest,
  I miss you the most and I  loved you the best,
  And now that you¡¯re gone I thank God I was blessed
  Just to know you.
But it¡¯s all right now.
Keep on  singin' loud.
It¡¯s all right now.
Heaven  should be proud.

To the one that I left behind
In a moment of glory, a face comes before me

question the course that I follow

He walked on by the rest of us as if he hadn't heard
A thousand bucks went to the man that could ride this wild Cayuse
A meaner horse was never born than the one they called The Brute
The horse that he was looking for was in chute number eight
He walked up very slowly put his hand upon the gate
We knew he was a thoroughbred when he pulled a sack of Dukes
From the inside pocket of his continental suit
He rolled himself a quirley and he lit it standing there
He blew himself a smoke ring and he watched it disappear
We thought he must be crazy when he opened up the gate
Standing just inside was fifteen hundred pounds of hate
The buckskin tried to run him down but the stranger was too quick
He stepped aside and threw his arms around the horse's neck
He pulled himself upon the back of the horse they called The Brute
Sat like he was born there in his continental suit
The Brute's hind end was in the air his front end on the ground
Kicking and a squealing trying to shake the stranger down
But the stranger didn't give an inch  he came to ride The Brute
And he came to ride the buckskin in a continental suit

By a city cowboy in some continental clothes

We don't know where he came from and we haven't seen him since

I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway
Where hustle's the name of the game
And nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain
There's been a load of compromizin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone
Well, I really don't mind the rain
But you're down when you're ridin' the train that's takin' the long way
And I dream of the things I'll do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe
There'll be a load of compromisin'
On the road to my horizon
But I'm gonna be where the lights are shinin' on me
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Rhinestone cowboy
Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know
And offers comin' over the phone
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star-spangled rodeo
Rhinestone cowboy
Gettin' cards and letters from people I don't even know

to ride on the crest of a wild raging       storm
To       work in the service of life and a living,
in search of the answers to questions un-      known
To be      part of the movement a part of the growing,
part of beginning to under-     stand,
   Aye Calypso the   places you've been to, 
the   things that you've   shown us, 
the   stories you  tell
  Aye Calypso, I  sing to your spirit,
the  men who have  served you 
so  long and so  well
Hi dee  ay-ee ooo  doo-dle  o 
oo do  do do do do  doo-dle ay  yee
Hi dee  ay-ee ooo  doo-dle  o

Like the       dolphin who guides you, you bring us beside you
To light up the darkness and       show us the way
For       though we are strangers in your silent world
To live on the land we must learn from the       sea
To be       true as the tide and free as a wind swell
Joyful and loving in letting it      be
   Aye Calypso the   places you've been to, 
the   things that you've   shown us, 
the   stories you  tell
  Aye Calypso, I  sing to your spirit,
the  men who have  served you 
so  long and so  well
   Aye Calypso the   places you've been to, 
the   things that you've   shown us,

49,Follow Me (ver 3),John Denver,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-denver/follow-me-chords-1869649,"It's by far the hardest thing__ I've ever done__
To be so in love with you and so alone.
Follow me__ where I go, what I do and who I know,
Make it part of you to be a part of me.
Follow me up and down all the way and all around.
Take my hand and say you'll follow me.
It's long been on my mind, you know it's been a long long time,
I'll try to find the way that I can make you understand
The way I feel about you and just how much I need you
To be there where I can talk to you when there's no one else around.
Follow me where I go, what I do and who I know
Make it part of you to be a part of me.
Follow me up and down, all the way and all around.
Take my hand and say you'll follow me.
You see I'd like to share my life with you 
And show you things I've seen,
Places that I'm going to, places where I've been,
To have you there beside me and never be alone,
And all the time that you're with me, then we will be at home.
Follow me where I go, what I do and who I know,
Make it part of you to be a part of me.
Follow me up and down all the way_______ 
Take my hand and I will follow too.

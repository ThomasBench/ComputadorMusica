0,Heartbreak Highway,Keith Whitley,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/keith-whitley/heartbreak-highway-chords-2688054,"Arms were hot and sweaty hope my heart is ready
Here goes  coming fast
Check the rear view river memories getting clearer
Right there  let it pass
Driving myself crazy I'm losing control
Looks like I'm headed for a rough and rocky road
Heartbreak highway fast lane to the blues
Each turn I take leads me back to you
and there's nothing I can do
Wrong way going over I've already been there
Can't see  through the rain
Truck stop coffee's bitter last night took forever
Can't see  through the pain
I still see you with me every time I lay down
That leaves a burning bridge to turn my life around
Heartbreak highway fast lane to the blues
Each turn I take leads me back to you
and there's nothing I can do
Something's starting shaking and falling apart
If something's breaking up it's gotta be my heart
Heartbreak highway fast lane to the blues
Each turn I take leads me back to you
and there's nothing I can do
Heartbreak highway fast lane to the blues
Heartbreak highway leads me back to you
Heartbreak highway fast lane to the blues
Heartbreak highway leads me back to you

1,You Put The Soul In The Song,Waylon Jennings,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/waylon-jennings/you-put-the-soul-in-the-song-chords-2360711,"         We started with nothing but each other and reached for the stars
         From a one room apartment,with a dream and a pawnshop guitar
         God gave the talent but you found the will to survive
         In a city of songs where dreamers are eaten alive
         I made the music,but you make the man
         When i stumbled and lose it,baby you'd understand
         When i was tempted to give up,your strength made me strong
         I make the music but you put the soul in the song
         When i look at you girl,i see a true work of art
         So many beautiful things in one little heart
         You're every word i ever wrote and every note that i ever sung
         You never stop believing,that's where the feeling comes from

2,House On Old Lonesome Road,Conway Twitty,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/conway-twitty/house-on-old-lonesome-road-chords-3778817,"Every night it's the same old grind
I leave work at five-o-five
Been doing my best to forget about her
But she's driving me out of my mind
When I get home I know what I'll find
How I wish that it wasn't so
There'll be no one there to hold me tonight
In that house on old lonesome road
I recall how we laughed when we read the name
In the paper before we moved in
After we did our friends all asked
If that house was lonesome back then
We were so young our dreams were so new
There's just no way that we could have known
The irony of that place where we loved
That house on old lonesome road
It's only shingles and shutters and a case of worn out stairs
Just like my old heart they need repair
Maybe I should sell it yeah maybe that would be the best
Maybe then someone else could find some love at that address
I used to love that old house so much
Back before she went away
Now everything there is just gathering dust
I should clean it up if I'm gonna stay
But I don't have too much time anymore
I'm too busy talking to ghosts
Cause her memory keeps me company
In that house on old lonesome road
It's only shingles and shutters and a case of worn out stairs
Just like my old heart they need repair
Maybe I should sell it yeah maybe that would be the best
Maybe then someone else could find some love at that address
Every night it's the same old grind

Been doing my best to forget about her

Till I found out the hard way there was some other man
Now what else could I do how could anyone blame me
To stand there smilin’ with a gun in his hands

Good love and affection can make anything right
But judge had no mercy for my infatuation
Said killin's a sin boy you gotta pay the price

Doin' what I can to get out of here
And these chains won't keep me from seein' my freedom
Changin' my name and startin’ over again
Down the hall there's a window you can barely see through it
Deep in the night I see the lights of town
And I started to thinking that a mystical ladder
Is as high as these walls and I'm climbin' it right one by one
These chains won't keep me from bein' a free man
Doin' what I can to get out of here

But she didn't blow out the birthday lights
Jamie and her momma had another big fight
She locked herself in her room
She climbed up on her window-seat
Sat and stared at the cars on the street
Listened to her own heart beat
And whispered to the moon
Am I the only one who cares what I do
'Cause if I'm the only one, then who can I turn to
Oh, moon can you tell me that it's not just me and you
Or am I the only one who cares
What I do_________

You're acting like there ain't nobody else
Come on girl take a big old breath
You know what you gotta do""

A woman's been standing at the window below
Searching for the words to let you know 
How much she loves you too""

Then the tall one he bumped in a dollar, He said boys I've got nothing to hide
Now if the King and the Queen stood together, Then the Ace he would not be to blame
And if the cards were all laid on the table, Then love could be more than a game
And if the stars didn't shine on the water
Then the sun wouldn't burn on the sand
And if I were the man she wanted
I would not be the man that I am      
And I have seen my share of long nights, And I have told my share of lies
And I have run into the darkness, When I saw the look in your eyes
But if the night didn't lie in the darkness, Then the daylight would be hard to find
And if the truth didn't turn to a weakness, I would never have spoken my mind
And if the stars didn't shine on the water
Then the sun wouldn't burn on the sand
And if I were the man you wanted
I would not be the man that I am

And if you think of the one there behind you, Then you might not feel so alone
And if the stars didn't shine on the water

It would never get off the ground
And I don’t know what make a big boat float
When its heavy enough to sink
If I was the man who drew up the plans
They’d probably have me walkin the plank
There’s a whole lot of things
That I don’t know
But one thing I do know that’s true
Just as long as I walk this earth
I’ll be lovin you
Oh, I’ll be lovin you (with my heart and soul)
As long as the world turns around
I’ll be lovin you (you ask me how I know)
That’s one thing I know a whole lot about
Shoop shoop shoop shoop
I don’t know what makes a young man run
From one woman to the next
There was a time I played that game
And I wound up a nerves reck
There’s a whole lot of things
That I don’t know
But one thing I do know that’s true
Just as long as I walk this earth
I’ll be lovin you
Just as long as I walk this earth
I’ll be lovin you
Just as long as I walk this earth
Oh, I’ll be lovin you, shoop shoop shoop

And I've seen the northern lights dance in the air

Old men go fishing with black line and spoons
And if they catch nothing they never complain
And I wish I was with them again
The boys in their boats call to girls on the shore
Teasing the ones that they dearly adore
And into the evening the courting begins
And I wish I was with them again
Can you imagine a piece of the universe
More fit for Princes and Kings
I'll trade you ten of your cities
For Marion Bridge and the pleasure it brings
Out on the Mira on soft summer nights
Bonfires blaze to the children's delight
They dance round the flames singing songs with their friends
And I wish I was with them again
And over the ashes stories are told
Of witches and werewolves and Oak Island gold

And if you come broken they'll see that you mend

Sweet be your dreams and your happiness swell

Like no other had before
And now his heart was just a token
Of the pain it had endured
And his memories were clouded
With all the hurtful things she'd said
Yes, for all intent and purpose
He might just as well been dead
And some people claim they still hear him call her name
Hey, hey, Maureen, swear they hear it just that plain
Deep in the night and sometimes right at dawn
See, his body died some years ago
But around here Mr. Johnson's love lives on
He seemed far away and distant
With that cold and silent stare
Never moving, never speaking
And just barely breathing air
No one really knew her reason
And who can judge her right or wrong
The only true and solemn fact is
The man we'd known was all but gone
And some people claim they still hear him call her name
Hey, hey, Maureen, swear they hear it just that plain
Deep in the night and sometimes right at dawn
See, his body died some years ago
But around here Mr. Johnson's love lives on
Sissy Thompson said she'd seen him
Late that night on Shelby Road
About a mile from there they found him
It seems he'd died out in the snow
I hear'd the preacher at the service
Say from love he's finally free
But I say love, it knows no season
It haunts the soul eternally
And some people claim they still hear him call her name
Hey, hey, Maureen, swear they hear it just that plain
Deep in the night and sometimes right at dawn
Yeah, his body died some years ago

Young and free we had nothing to hide
And we were doing all the things that nobody told us
Summer days when there weren’t any courses
Down at the creek riding make believe horses
Acting out westerns that they had seen
Down at the picture show movie screen
One year later feeling 5 years older
Still scared of the girls but we were acting much bolder
And in the evening when the sun went down
Back street, make out, fooling around

Then he tied a cord, to the end of a mop
And said, ""son, here's a pony, keep her at a trot""
And I'd ride in circles while he laughed a lot
Then I'd flop down beside him
And he was ninety years old in '63
And I loved him and he loved me
And lord, I cried the day he died
'Cause I thought, that he walked, on water
And if the story was told, only heaven knows
But his hat seemed to me, like an old halo
And though his wings, they were never seen
I thought that he walked, on water
Yeah, I thought that he walked, on water

It's just a matter of time
After I gave you everything I had 
You laughed and you called me a clown

What goes up must come down

That my love is a true love

I hate to see you torn a part

Oh, girl I believe in destiny
I bless the day he set you free
And, I know that it sounds selfish of me
But, I love the way he left you
But, I hate the way you hurt
I thank my lucky stars a bove
That I got to you first
Don't you see he lead you
Right into my arms
I'd tell you that I'm sorry
But I, I love the way he left you
Girl, I know that you still see his face
It's something that I can't er ase
That's a chance I just have to take

I know you're gonna be al right
I'm gonna drive him out of your mind

49,Battle Of Armageddon,Hank Williams,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/hank-williams/battle-of-armageddon-chords-1754979,"There's a mighty battle coming and it's well now on its way.
It'll be fought at Armageddon, it shall be a sad, sad day.
In the Book of Revelation, words in chapter sixteen say
«There'll be gathered there great armies for that battle on that day.»
All the way from the gates of Eden to the Battle of Armageddon
There's been troubles and tribulation, there'll be sorrow and despair.
He has said «Ye not be troubled for these things shall come to pass.»
Then your life will be eternal when you dwell with Him at last.
Turn the pages of your Bible, in St. Matthew you will see,
Start with chapter twenty-four and read from one to thirty-three.
In our Savior's blessed words He said on earth, He prophesised,
For He spoke of this great battle that is coming by and by.
All the way from the gates of Eden to the Battle of Armageddon
There's been troubles and tribulation, there'll be sorrow and despair.
He has said «Ye not be troubled for these things shall come to pass.»
Then your life will be eternal when you dwell with Him at last.
There'll be nation against nation, there'll be wars and rumors of war.
There'll be great signs in Heaven, in the moon, the sun, the stars.
Oh, the hearts of men shall fail them, there'll be gnashing of the teeth.
Those who seek it will recieve it, mercy at the Savior's feet.
All the way from the gates of Eden to the Battle of Armageddon
There's been troubles and tribulation, there'll be sorrow and despair.
He has said «Ye not be troubled for these things shall come to pass.»
Then your life will be eternal when you dwell with Him at last.

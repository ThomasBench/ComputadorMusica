0,Fly Away (ver 3),John Denver,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-denver/fly-away-chords-1059924,"All of her days have gone soft and cloudy
All of her dreams have gone dry
All of her nights have gone sad and shady
Fly away
Fly away
Fly away
Life in the city can make you crazy
For sounds of the sand and the sea
Life in the high rise can make you hungry
For things that you can't even see
In this whole world there's nobody as lonely as she
There's nowhere to go and there's nowhere that she'd rather be
She's looking for lovers and children playing
She's looking for signs of the spring
She listens for laughter and sounds of dancing
She listens for any old thing

Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze 
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, Mountain Mama

Miners' Lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky 
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye 
Country roads, take me home

Take me home, country roads

The radio reminds me of my home far away

That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

3,Matthew,John Denver,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-denver/matthew-chords-277170,"I had an uncle name of Matthew...he was his father's only boy
Born just south of Colby, Kansas...he was his mother's pride and joy
   CHORUS:  Yes, and joy was just the thing he was raised on
   Love was just a way to live and die
   Gold was just a windy Kansas wheat field
   Blue was just a Kansas summer sky
And all the stories that he told me back when I was just a lad
All the memories that he gave me...all the good times that he had
Growin' up a Kansas farmboy...life was mostly havin' fun
Ridin' on his daddy's shoulders behind a mule, beneath the sun
Well, I guess there were some hard times and I'm told some years were lean
They had a storm in '47...twister came and stripped 'em clean
He lost the farm and lost his family...he lost the wheat, he lost his home
But he found the family bible and faith as solid as a stone
So he came to live at our house...and he came to work the land
He came to ease my daddy's burdens and he came to be my friend
So I wrote this down for Matthew...it's for him this song is sung
Ridin' on his daddy's shoulders behind a mule, beneath the sun

4,Back Home Again (ver 3),John Denver,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-denver/back-home-again-chords-1144021,"There's a storm across the valley, clouds are rollin' in 
The afternoon is heavy on your shoulders. 
There's a truck out on the four lane, a mile or more away 
The whinin' of his wheels just makes it colder. 
He's an hour away from ridin' on your prayers up in the sky 
And ten days on the road are barely gone. 
There's a fire softly burning, supper's on the stove 
But it's the light in your eyes that makes him warm. 
Hey, it's good to be back home a-gain 
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend 
Yes'n, hey it's good to be back home a-gain 
After all the news to tell him: how'd you spend your time? 
And what's the latest thing the neighbors say 
And your mother called last friday; ""Sunshine"" made her cry 
And you felt the baby move just yester-day. 
Hey, it's good to be back home a-gain 
Sometimes this old farm feels like a long lost friend 
Yes'n, hey it's good to be back home a-gain 
And oh, the time that I  can lay this tired old body down 
And feel your fingers feather soft up-on me 
The kisses that I live for, the love that lights my way 
The happiness that livin' with you brings me. 
It's the sweetest thing I know of, just spending time with you 
It's the little things that make a house a home. 
Like a fire softly burning and supper on the stove. 
And the light in your eyes that makes me warm

Comin' home to a place he'd never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door
When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
On the road and hangin' by a song
But the string's already broken and he doesn't really care
It keeps changin' fast and it don't last for long

I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
The shadows from the starlight are softer than a lull---a---bye
Rocky mountain high    (Colorado)
 Rocky mountain high   (high in Colorado)
He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below 
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept the memory
Now he walks in quiet solitude the forest and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake
But the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
Talk to God and listen to the casual    re--ply
Rocky mountain high    (Colorado)
 Rocky mountain high   (high in Colorado)
Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land
But the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky

He was born in the summer of his 27th year
Comin' home to a place he'd never been before
He left yesterday behind him, you might say he was born again
You might say he found a key for every door
When he first came to the mountains his life was far away
On the road and hangin' by a song
But the string's already broken and he doesn't really care
It keeps changin' fast and it don't last for long
But the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it raining' fire in the sky
The shadows from the starlight are softer than a lull---a---bye
Rocky mountain high    (Colorado)
Rocky mountain high   (high in Colorado)
He climbed cathedral mountains, he saw silver clouds below
He saw everything as far as you can see
And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun
And he lost a friend but kept the memory
Now he walks in quiet solitude the forest and the streams
Seeking grace in every step he takes
His sight has turned inside himself to try and understand
The serenity of a clear blue mountain lake
In the Colorado   Rocky Mountain High
I've seen it raining' fire in the sky
   Talk to God and listen to the casu---al  re---ply
Rocky mountain high    (Colorado)
Rocky mountain high   (high in Colorado)
Now his life is full of wonder but his heart still knows some fear
Of a simple thing he cannot comprehend
Why they try to tear the mountains down to bring in a couple more
More people, more scars upon the land
But the Colorado rocky mountain high
I've seen it rainin' fire in the sky
    I know he'd be a poorer man if he never saw an ea----gle fly

there are children raised beneath a golden sun.
There are children of the water, children of the sand,
and they cry out through the universe, their voices raised as one:
I want to live, I want to grow, I want to see, I want to know,
I want to share what I can give, I want to be, I want to live.
Have you gazed out on the ocean, seen the breaching of a whale?
Have you watched the dolphins frolic in the foam?
Have you heard the song the humpback hears five hundred miles away?
Telling tales of ancient history of passages and home?
I want to live, I want to grow, I want to see, I want to know,
I want to share what I can give, I want to be, I want to live.
For the worker and the warrior, the lover and the liar, 
For the native and the wanderer in kind.
For the maker and the user, and the mother and her son.
I am looking for my family and all of you are mine.
We are standing all together, face to face and arm in arm.
We are standing on the threshold of a dream.
No more hunger, no more killing, no more wasting life away.
It is simply an idea and I know its time has come.
I want to live, I want to grow, I want to see, I want to know,
I want to share what I can give, I want to be,
I want to live, I want to grow, I want to see, I want to know,
I want to share what I can give, I want to be, I want to live.

Of the choice of a lady
 and the love of a man
How he loved her so dearly,
 he went out of his mind
When she left him for someone
 she'd left behind 
It was the time of the preacher
 in the year of 01
Now the preachin' is over 
and the lesson's begun
An' he cried like a baby
He screamed her name in the Night
An' he saddled his pony
An' he went for a ride
It was the time of the preacher
 in the year of 01
Now the preachin' is over 
and the killin's begun
But he could not forgive her
 though he tried and tried 
And the halls of his memories
 still echo her lies

An' just when you think it's all over 
it's only begun
It was the time of the preacher
 when the story began
Of the choice of a lady

Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
Took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my har'poon out of my dirty red bandana
I was playin' sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield whipers slappin' time and Bobby clappin' hands
We finally sang up ever song that driver knew
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' left is all she left for me
Feeling good was easy Lord when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling it was good enough for me good enough for me and Bobby McGee
From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Every night she'd keep me from the cold
Somewhere near Salinas Lord Bobby slipped away
Lookin' for the home I hope she'll find
I'd trade all of my tomorrows for just one yesterday
Holding her body close to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feeling good was easy Lord when Bobby sang the blues
Feeling it was good enough for me good enough for me and Bobby McGee

And the high flying trains no longer roll
The floors are all sagging with boards
That are suffering from not being used anymore
Things are all changing and the world's
Rearranging a time that will soon be no more
Where has a slow moving once quick-draw
Outlaw got to go
The whiskey that once settled the dust
And tasted so fine now tastes of pain
And the memories it once blotted out come back
Stronger and more clearly with each drink you take
The women that warmed you once thought so pretty
Now look haggard and old
Where has a slow moving once quick-draw
Outlaw got to go
The land where I traveled once fashioned with beauty
Now stands with scars on her face
And the wide open spaces are closing in quickly
From the weight of the whole human race
And it's not that I blame them for claiming her bounty
I just wish they'd taken it slow
Cause where has a slow moving once quick-draw
Outlaw got to go

I've made a point to let it show
Cloudy days, don't the sun ever shine anymore

I recall the time when times were good
Lord, they seem so long ago

And held your hand in mine
And now when you hold another's hands

While the cool summer breeze
Blew away the sands of time
And thought of days when you were near
Remembering when you were mine
Gone are the times when I held you close
And pressed your lips to mine
Now when you kiss another's lips

Your habits, my dear, were surely absurd
But how many times do I have to tell you
Soup is a dish to be seen and not heard
Where, where, are you tonight?
Why did you leave me here all alone?
I searched the world over,
And thought I found true love.
Phht! you were gone.
Remember you phoned me a-sobbin' and cryin'
The dog bit your maw, and drug her around
You said she looked pale and thought she was dying
I said ""Don't worry, I'll buy a new hound.""
Where, where, are you tonight?
Why did you leave me here all alone?
I searched the world over,
And thought I found true love.
Phht! you were gone.
I went to your house at three in the morning.
You had all them curlers and junk in your hair.
You would not have scared me and I'd not have run so,
If you had not looked like you'd wrestled a bear.
Where, where, are you tonight?
Why did you leave me here all alone?
I searched the world over,
And thought I found true love.
Phht! you were gone.
You took out your false teeth, your wig and your glasses.
And you shoud've seen the look on my face
I wanted to kiss you and hug you so tightly.
I guess that I would have if I'd found your face.
Where, where, are you tonight?
Why did you leave me here all alone?
I searched the world over,
And thought I found true love.
Phht! you were gone.
I know that you loved me, here's my way of knowing
The proofs hanging out right there on the line
When I see the snow and feel the wind blowing
Your nighties hugging them long johns of mine
Where, where, are you tonight?
Why did you leave me here all alone?
I searched the world over,
And thought I found true love.
Phht! you were gone.
I told you, my darlin', you looked like a gopher.
Made you so mad, you haven't spoke since.
But tell me my darling if you ain't got buck teeth.
How do you eat apples through a picket fence?
Where, where, are you tonight?
Why did you leave me here all alone?
I searched the world over,
And thought I found true love.
Phht! you were gone.
When I picked you up for our date last weekend.
You looked so pretty in satin and lace.
But when I bent over and started to kiss you, 
You popped a pimple all over my face!
Where, where, are you tonight?
Why did you leave me here all alone?
I searched the world over,
And thought I found true love.
Phht! you were gone.
Down here on the farm the weather gets messy
Laying around with nothin' to do
When you went away, you took my cow Bessie
I miss her darling, more than I miss you
Where, where, are you tonight?
Why did you leave me here all alone?
I searched the world over,
And thought I found true love.
Phht! you were gone.

Woke up in my rockin' chair, holdin' a beer in my hand,
Sportin' a neon tan
My stereo cranked up, I can't find my truck
How'd I get home from the club?
Ain't got a clue what went down, so I started callin' around
And all my friends say I started shootin' doubles when you walked in
All my friends say I went a little crazy seein' you with him
You know I don't remember a thing
But they say I sure was raisin' some Cain
I was a rock-star, party-hard, gettin' over you comeback kid
Yeah, I musta did what all my friends say (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I found my billfold, I cried oh, no, no
Good Time Charlie got me, now I'm broke
But it was worth actin' like a fool
Yeah, girl, I must've really showed you
'Cause all my friends say I started shootin' doubles when you walked in
All my friends say I went a little crazy seein' you with him

you ok He said
I just climbed out of the cotton wood tree
I was running from some honey bees
Drip-drying in the summer breeze
After jumpin' into Calico Creek
I was walkin' down an old dirt road
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed
Man I wish you'd just left me alone
Cause I was almost home
Then he said, I was just comin' round the barn,
I heard momma holler son hurry up
I was close enough for my own nose
I saw daddy loadin' up the truck
Cane poles on the tailgate bobbers blowin' in the wind Since
July of 55 that's as close as I've been
Yeah I just climbed out of the cotton wood tree
I was running from some honey bees
Drip-drying in the summer breeze
After jumpin' into Calico Creek
I was walkin' down an old dirt road
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed
Man I wish you'd just left me alone
Cause I was almost home
I said old man you're gonna freeze to death
Let me drive you to the mission
He said boy if you'd left me alone
Right now I'd be fishin'
I just climbed out of the cotton wood tree
I was running from some honey bees
Drip-drying in the summer breeze
After jumpin' into Calico Creek

Walked on that next summer
Wound up getting cut
Flipped off that coach, left that school in the dust
For letting my dreams go bust

Coulda been a corner office, country club, suit and tie man
Answerin' to no one, but her and him
I ran out on his money, ran out on her love
At four in the morning I loaded my truck
I left my home town in a big cloud of dust
I just had to follow my gut

Pouring out my heart for tips on a stool
I ain't making a killing, but then theres those nights
When the song comes together and hits them just right
The crowds on their feet cause they can't get enough

Sure I've got a minute but I can't stay long
I've got someone waiting for me outside
Damn you sure look just like I remember
It's too bad things turned out like they did
You've got that same look in your eyes now
Last time I saw it you were leaving
Has anybody ever told you you sure cry pretty
You stand tall and move with grace
Has anybody ever told you you sure cry pretty
Tears fall don't leave a trace
Yeah I thought about you for a little while
Yeah I guess I still do now and then
If only this had been another time girl
Maybe you might just break me down
Has anybody ever told you you sure cry pretty
You stand tall move with grace
Has anybody ever told you you sure cry pretty
Tears fall don't leave a trace
It's time for me to go I hope you understand
I'm sure that you'll be fine once I'm gone
I'm sure there's someone out there you can turn to
Just keep your head up girl and you'll be fine
Has anybody ever told you you sure cry pretty
You stand tall move with grace
Has anybody ever told you you sure cry pretty
Tears fall don't leave a trace

Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you’re not pretty
But that’s not true, cause I know you…
Hold on, baby, you’re losing it
The water’s high, you’re jumping into it
And letting go... and no one knows
You cry, but you don’t tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you’re tied together with a smile
But you’re coming undone
I guess it’s true that love was all you wanted
Cause you’re giving it away like it’s extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh, cause it’s not his price to pay
Hold on, baby, you’re losing it
The water’s high, you’re jumping into it

Discovered I'd been wrong for so long
I thought it was the fame and the glory and the money

I woke up in the morning she was gone
And the note that she wrote didnt say dear john
It said goodbye fucker im gone
She was a homegrown mountain girl
Raised in a different world
I was a wanna be rocker She was more into Merle
Couldn't see it just wouldn't work
And now I'm double fisting long necks, grapefruit and Stoli
But I'm never getting over Joely
Well I poured myself in my car
I drove it on down to the bar
But they wouldn't let me in Cause I ain't a movie star
So I went to the Horse Shoe on Lamar
Well the bouncer threw me out too
And I didn't know what to do
So I picked up the phone And I called dear Sue
The cock blocker wouldn't let me through
And now I'm wishing for some drugs or a shrink to console me
But I'm never getting over Joely
Well I gathered up all my guns
And a pipe bomb just for fun
I drove to her house and parked out on the lawn
She's right I always was the crazy one.
Well her boyfriend was sure nice to me
Said ""calm down would you like a drink""
And I shot him full of holes From his nose to his knees
And I polished off her little sweet pea
And I'm crying on me knees feeling dirty and unholy
But I'm never getting over Joely

Winter's stuck around so long
I kept trying anyhow and I'm still trying now
Just to keep working, just to keep working.
I remember when it didn't use to be so hard
This used to be impossible
A new season has to begin
I can feel it leaning in whispering
""Nothing's lonely now”
Nothing anymore in pain.
A tall shadow dressed how secrets always dress
When they want everyone to know that they're around.
Leaning in whispering

That everyone makes it out?
Almost no one makes it out.

To hide from what was shining and has finally burned us out.

Your eyes were open and sure, anyone could look right in.
As I followed closely your gaze, you looked up towards the sky,
And I watched your face drift away, other things had caught your eye.
Oh, the magazines and media supplied you with their plastic protocol,
Oh, and maybe music television really is the devil after all.
But all I can say is I knew you before you were beautiful back then,
Before you grew up,      Before you gave in.
You dream of sharing your heart, instead you share your bed,
And your heart beats empty and cold with all the tears you have shed.
And you dream of baring your soul, instead you bare more skin,
And you wear dark glasses to keep anyone from looking in.

So you hike your skirt higher still till their eyes are all on you.
You drive in fast foreign cars the color of your sin,
And you tint your windows to keep anyone from looking in.

He was dropped in the jungle where the choppers would rumble
With the smell of napalm in the air
And the seargent said
Look up ahead
Like a dark evil cloud twelve hundred came down
On him and twenty-nine more
They fought for their lives but most of them died
In the 173rd airborne
On the 8th of November the angels were crying
As they carried his brothers away
With the fire raining down and the hell all around
There were few men left standing that day
Saw an eagle fly through a clear blue sky
Nineteen-sixty-five
the 8th of November
Now he's fifty-eight and his pony tail's gray
But the battle still plays in his head
He limps when he walks but he's strong when he talks
About the shrapnell they left in his leg
He puts on a suit over his airborne tatoo
He ties it on one time a year
He remembers the fallen as he orders a tall one
And swallows it down with his tears

  Sometimes I don't even know the reason why
so I Guess I'll keep on gambling'
Lots of booze and lots of rambling'
It's easier than just waitin around   to die.
Once I had a Ma, I even had a Pa
He hit her with a belt once 'cause she cried
She told him to take care of me
Headed back to Tennessee
It was easier 'n just waitin around   to die.
I came of age and I met a girl
in a Tuscaloosa bar
She cleaned me out and hid it on the sly
well I tried to kill the pain
I bought some wine and hopped a train
It was easier than just waiting around   to die
My friend said he knew where some easy money was
We robbed a man and brother did we fly
But The posse caught up with me
drug me back to muskogee
Now it's two long years of waitng around  to die.
Now I'm out of prison
I got me a friend at last
He don't drink, or  cheat, or steal, or lie
His name's codeine
he's the finest thing I've seen
and together we're gonna wait around to die.

Rows of cotton 'bout knee high,
Mrs. Baker down the dirt road,
Still got clothes out on the line,
Erwin Nichols there with Judge Lee,
Playin' checkers at the gin,
When I dream about the southland,
This is where it all begins,
From Carolina down to Georgia,
Smell the jasmine and magnolia,
Sleepy sweet home Alabama,
Roll tide roll,
Muddy water, Mississippi,
Blessed Graceland whispers to me,
Carry on, Carry on,
Sweet Southern Comfort carry on,
Catchin' catfish on the river,
Chasin fireflies by the creek,
Kissin' Debbie Williams sister,
On the porch Homecomin' week,
With rusty cars and weeping willows,
Keepin watch out in the yard,
Just a snapshot of downhome Dixie,
Could be anywhere you are,
In Carolina or in Georgia,
Open arms are waitin for ya,
Louisiana yellow rose of San Antone,
Arkansas, Mississippi,
Old man river whispers to me,
Carry on, Carry on,
Sweet Southern Comfort carry on,
As I sit here I'm surrounded,
By these priceless memories,
I don't have to think about it,
There's no place I'd rather be,
In Carolina or in Georgia,
Smell the jasmine and magnolia,
Sleepy sweet home Alabama,
Roll tide roll,
Muddy water, Mississippi,
Blessed Graceland whispers to me,
Carry on, Carry on,

Sweet Southern Comfort carry on,

And my brain spits bad ideas out of my mouth
Like a thousand words circuits burst crowd screaming hear comes the hearse
And I’m jumping now out of my chest as the crowds begin to scream
And the winos wait into the bar rooms to drink away the dreams
And I can hear years’ worth of traffic outside on that dirty street
I can see the lights turn from red to black to blue to brown to green
And I’ve been staring for so long my eyes begin to bleed
Yes I’ve been staring for so long my eyes begin to bleed
     When I was a young one they told me I left my rights at the door and
     As I grow older this becomes true more and more
     Now I’m just staring out that open door
I should be screaming but I aint got no tears no more
I aint got no tears aint got no tears no more
I aint got no tears aint got no tears no more
Guess I lost a few things that were dear to me
Like my arms and my legs and my body and my soul and my will to speak
Now there just sliding fast towards that ocean floor beneath
Trying to not be pulled under by the waves and the weeds
     Rain on the roof fit together so click like a tailor made suit
It’s like pull aim click bang soar and shoot
And the rain and the wind they lick my skin till its freezing smooth
And they heal over years of a thousand bloody wounds
Oh yes they heal over years of a thousand bloody wounds
     When I was a young one they told me I left my rights at the door and
     As I grow older this becomes true more and more

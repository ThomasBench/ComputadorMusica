Hang the scenes that are painted from life
Then there's pictures of peace and of strife
There hang pictures of youth and of beauty
Of old age and the blushing young bride
They all hang on the wall but the saddest of all
Are the pictures from life's other side
]Tis a picture from life's other side
Someone who's fell by the way
That might have been happy some day
There's a poor old mother at home
Just watching and waiting alone
She's longing to hear from her loved one so dear
It's just a picture from life's other side
The first scene is that of a gambler
Who had lost all his money at play
Yes, the one she wore on her wedding day
His last earthly treasure, he stakes it
And he bows his head, his shame he might hide
Then when they lifted his head they found he was dead
Another picture from life's other side
The next tale is that of two brothers
Whose paths in life, different led.
But the other brother begged for his bread.
Then one dark night they met on the highway
Your money or life, the thief cried.
And then with his knife, he took his own brother's life
Just a picture from life's other side.
Now the last scene is that by the river
Of a heartbroken mother and babe
On an outcast whom no one will save
And yet she was once a true woman
She was somebody's darling and pride
God help her she leaps, but there's no one to weep
It's just a picture from life's other side
There's a new scene now in Korea
Of a boy with a gun in the snow.
He's fighting for us, as you know
He's lonesome and weary and frightened
His life may go out with the tide
But pray God he'll return to the loved ones who yearn
It's just a picture from life's other side

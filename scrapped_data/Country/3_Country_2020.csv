I lay under them dreamin', your face all I see
I'm caught up in fever and shiverin' too
All that's keepin' me alive is the thought of losing you
Juanita when I found you I was at my end
So hold on Juanita, I'll find you again
You are the ocean, I am a grain of sand
In waves of motion a violent and craven man
But the day that I found you, calm washed over the storm
Sun came up, soft blue eyes and the moon , and I'm so worn
Juanita, where'd your Mama get that name?
There's no senoritas from the mountains where you came
And if I ever saw one, she wouldn't be pretty as you
With black hair so long, soft eyes so blue
Juanita, I'll search the world 'til you're in my hands
Juanita I'll find you,
I'll find you again

Show that boy the real me

What my tombstone would say
Would they mention any of my good
Or just evil in my days
The dust has now settled
From those boys who busted in
I am not a bad man
But there's bullets in my skin

Of the pain that leaves permanent marks

And a ship that is tossed on the waves
And the wreckage I find on the shoreline
And what’s left of the ones I can’t save
I am the witch of the water

Bewitched by invisible forces
To lead you away from the light
Oh, I sing to the flow of the river
To the shadows of black and of blue
For the thunder that echoes above me
Is the rhythm that I’m writing to
The tales of the ones who are heavy
The lonely, the lost and the gone
Are the searchers that break through my levy
And the well water that I have drunk
I am the witch of the water
I come like a thief in the night
Bewitched by invisible forces
To lead you away from the light
Follow me into the current
And seeking the magic below
Wait where no happy man searches
In the place only mad women go

I come like a thief in the night
Bewitched by invisible forces

In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer though a youth of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one an nineteen more
One and nineteen more
Now the stranger started talking made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizona ranger wouldn't be too long in town
He came here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter he was after Texas Red
After Texas Red
Wasn't long before the story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry men that tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take twenty men had made a slip
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
Well,the morning passed so quickly it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they walked out in the street
Folks were watching from their windows every-body held their breath
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death
About to meet his death
There was forty feet between them when they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the ranger is still talked about to-day
Texas Red had not cleared leather for a bullet fairly ripped
And the rangers aim was deadly with the big iron on his hip
The big iron on his hip
It was over in a moment and the folks had gathered round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh he might have gone on living but he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip
Big iron Big iron
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip
Big iron on his hip

And often times,
Boys from this town,
Put wheels down and disappear,
Mrs. Cole asked about you
Just three days back,
And I had no answer to give her,
I told her that you moved way out west,
To write some songs and grow a little more bitter,
The kids talk about you around here
Like you’re some kind of legend
I wonder if they know a thousand sunrises ago
You were eager just like them.
But if you ever decide to bring your pain and your pride
Back to this side of Oklahoma City,
There’ll be a porch light on,
From the post you leaned on
Before you wound up on the wrong side of pity,
And often times I pray for you and often times I don’t,
Is it the goodbyes that haunt you or the fear of new hellos,
You won't stay for long 'cause you won’t stop your running,
Wait for tomorrow until tomorrow’s not coming.
Heard you landed in Tulsa while he slipped away,
Is that the reason your fleeing the fields we hauled hay,
Heat this July or the dark last December,
Look in my eyes and you might remember,
Weed out in Norman, the Stillwater strip,
Run far enough boy and you’re bound to trip.
But if you ever decide to bring your pain and your pride

And taking him fishing and busting his butt
When he ain't acting right
I hope he's in every prayer his momma prays
And has a sense of humor
Gonna need it for a girl like this
God bless the boy that melts the way I do
When she smiles at him the first time
He'll be done, oh, he'll be through
Give him patiеnce and kindness
And a heart that's full of hеr
And the sense to know just what she's worth
'Cause ain't nobody ever gonna be good enough
So God bless the boy she decides to love
God bless the boy that melts the way I do
When she smiles at him the first time
He'll be done, oh, he'll be through
There ain't nobody ever gonna be good enough
So God bless the boy she decides to love
Oh, God bless the boy she decides to love

But I'm lonely tonight and I just betcha
Might have some wisdom to pull Of that shelf
Your songs were all fun, 'til I lived them myself
I ain't a coal miner's daughter but my grandmother was
Must be whiskey in the water Must be bourbon in the blood
I'm a long way from Kentucky but the hurtin's the same
Now I know why you sang that way
What ended up tough started out broken
What ended up lost started out hopin'
A lifetime of pain was three minutes long
And you weren't ashamed when the world sang along
I ain't a coal miner's daughter but my grandmother was
Must be whiskey in the water Must be bourbon in the blood
I'm a long way from Kentucky but the hurtin's the same
Now I know why you sang that way
Dear Miss Loretta we both grew up too fast
I wish you could tell me How you made it last
I ain't a coal Miner's daughter But I've sung it all my life
I ain't been a widow But I've been an ex-wife
I hear your truth and I feel your pain
Now I know why you sang that way

From the wretched underworld to the place where fear resides
Behind the line you hold, you can only hold so long
When you see my forked tongue and you hear my twisted song
My sign is the fire line, uncontrolled
My bitter ruthlessness is a beacon to behold
Like cancer growin', someday to die
Where the watеr's flowin', I'm gonna drain the river dry
'Cause it's a poison drеam
Keeps me runnin' through the night
I'll take it all, and then some more
By the dawnin' of the sickly mornin' light
Burn through the midnight oil and the bridges I can't cross
Somehow, I'll find myself in everything you've lost
We've seen it all before, but it comes as no surprise
Just like reflections of the fire in your eyes
'Cause it's a poison drеam
Keeps me runnin' through the night
I'll take it all, and then some more
By the dawnin' of the sickly mornin' light
And when the work is done and the Devil's called his time
You'll feel a sterile breeze that blows through ashen pine
And you may ask yourself, ""Where did the endgame lie?""
The question I might ask if I could stop to wonder why
'Cause it's a poison drеam
Keeps me runnin' through the night
I'll take it all, and then some more
By the dawnin' of the sickly mornin' light
'Cause it's a poison drеam
Keeps me runnin' through the night
I'll take it all, and then some more
By the dawnin' of the sickly mornin' light

He loved howlin' at the moon
He loved treein' that racoon
Most of all, he was my best friend
And he's gone too soon
He was the runt of the litter but a plenty mean pup
Put Sam on the scent, and he never let up
Spent his nights on the porch, chеwin' on a bare bone

 The stench of darkness and defeat
 Another day without relief
 Leaves me broken
 Curtains falling all around
 Echoes up from underground
 Screaming out without a sound
 Leaves me breathless
Well, it's a dark time, I do believe
A cold wind's a-blowin' at my door
Incredible light I'm gonna find
Where I don't have to worry anymore
 A feast for eyes deprived of peace
 Internal pressure, no release
 Pain eternal, my disease
 Never-ending
 Paralyzed and drowned in thought
 All the things that I have lost
 My salvation can't be bought
 Drains me empty
Well, it's a dark time, I do believe
A cold wind's a-blowin' at my door
Incredible light I'm gonna find
Where I don't have to worry anymore
 I wasn't ready to believe
 Constant failure to achieve
 Nothing hidden up my sleeve
 I remember
Well, it's a dark time, I do believe
A cold wind's a-blowin' at my door
Incredible light I'm gonna find
Where I don't have to worry anymore

You got a touch that kills me, makes me feel alive
Couldn't turn me off, yeah, even if you tried
So keep turnin' me on and turn out the lights
Who knows tonight, we might get it right

With the pattern of my life laid out
And I asked what I’ve been asking you
Like trees repeat, like numerals do
Like a ladder to the atmosphere
The rungs each come again and again
And I let it
Land me down and tether me ’till I get it
When we landed in Orlando
And the local time was 11:11
The pilot had his eyes closed
Through that opalescent open road
And then time spread and expanded
The lines fanned out across the land
And I let it
Land me down and tether me ’till I get it
Can I leave the canopy forever
And land me down eternally

Undo the knots that I'm in
Lift me up just to break me again and again
Shine a light on my darkness
Undo the costs of my sins
Lift me up just to hate me again and again
This life is but a dream
Not always what it seems
Pull me under
Save yourself
I'm the one who
Needs the help
It's all because of me
That you haunt me in my dreams
Give it all just to hold you
Take away all of your pain
Lift you up like an angel again and again
I cling so desperately
To what we used to be
Pull me under
Save yourself
I'm the one who
Needs the help
It's all because of me

So close to the sky, felt like I could touch it
I've been in a gold shore sand
Drinking rum-runners out of a bucket
But today I'm in this long-lost highway town

And I'm liking where we're headed now
Throwing quarters down that jukebox

You got the lonely I brought in here
Almost gone without a trace

You're a hangover I'd love to wake up to
So come on, baby, whiskey me away
Come on, baby, whiskey me away

So let's keep on working on it
Telling some stories, how where we went wrong
Got us right here, lost in a moment
Yeah, let's make it last, make up a slow dance
To Tennessee river and mountain man

'Cause I can't forgive or forget

You get what you get
You can't keep tellin' lies and changin' your story
And expect the whole world to believe
And use the Stars and the Stripes to serve your own glory

And I don't have amnesia and Lord knows I ain't Jesus
'Cause I can't forgive or forget
And sometimes when you give what you give
You get what you get

If you're gonna point fingers, well I got two for you

A man can get drunk on your life
But my hangover's gone and my give-a-fuck's empty
It's gone just like yesterday's wine
And I don't have amnesia and Lord knows I ain't Jesus

Whеre the Cumberland rows, thе soft wind blows
And home, it ain't far away

Just hangin' out every day

Are your Nashville nights still warm?
Somewhere to the west of town
Well, it's comin' up a storm
Are your rivers dark and muddy
Where the green swamp willows grow?
Nine more days and I'll be home
Lord, back in off the road

Somebody always pays when you get it on the cheap

Banging on the windows of my glasshouse
I get a little hazy on the details

Like getting launched into deep space
In nothing but a nightshirt and a neck brace

There was something going on
You do something to me that I can't explain
Every beat of my heart
We've got something going on
Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel
We ride it together, ah-ha
Making love with each other, ah-ha

That is what we are
No one in between
Sail away with me
To another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ha

I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing, if you got no one
And you did walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing
That won't happen to us and we got no doubt
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing
No more will you cry
Baby, I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
We can ride it together, ah-ha

On the lip of the collapsing letter
In the lap of the confusing moon

I'm consumed by all the shit in my room
Well then maybe if you pick my room up
Carve a path in my moonlit floor
Through the colors I adorn my body with
In ritual
Nowadays I usually just get up
Put on a sweater from the day before
Like you said it's got to get better
I wear my shadow like a uniform
I'm torn right through
Divided right in two
So while I do align my library
By the colors on the spine of my books
When I'm looking for a resolution
But there's wreckage everywhere I look
and there's brambles scratching at the window
and there's silver shining on the thorns
I could've sworn the moon's singing to me
Strung in a phase so strange and torn
Now the stars look fake and strung up
and the colors on the floor are worn
and the hues on my body are muted
In the shadow, my uniform
I'm torn right through
Divided right in two
I'm lost without using
The brightest light I knew
That I knew

47,Put Me Back Together,Caitlyn Smith,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/caitlyn-smith/put-me-back-together-chords-2942498,"  Ain't never met nobody
Nobody that can love me
  You put your hands on my body
  And I know that you got me
When I'm fallin' into you
  You take me high, but I'm dropping low
Even when we're just ridin' 'round town getting stoned
Boy, you put me back together again
  My Coca-Cola Hennesy
But you're my fucked up remedy
Boy, you put me back together again
  Oh, hooh
  Oh, ooh
  hooh-ooh hooh
  When you're lying with me on the car hood
Sharing cigarette dreams
  You don't care that I'm broken
  You just say that I'm golden
Like your Jesus piece
  You take me high, but I'm dropping low
Even when we're just riding 'round town getting stoned
Boy, you put me back together again
  My Coca-Cola Hennesy
But you're my fucked up remedy
Boy, you put me back together again
  Oh, hooh
  Oh, ooh
  Oh, hooh
  Oh, ooh
  hooh-ooh hooh
  You take me high, but I'm dropping low
Even when we're just riding 'round town getting stoned

But you're my fucked up remedy
Boy, you put me back together again
Oh, hooh
Oh, ooh

48,And Its Still Alright (ver 2),Nathaniel Rateliff,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/nathaniel-rateliff/and-its-still-alright-chords-3007298,"It ain't alright, the hardness of my head
Now close your eyes and spin around
Say, hard times, you could find
That it ain't the way that you want
But it's still alright
Late at night, do you lay around wondering?
Counting all the lines, it ain't so funny now
Say, times are hard, you get this far
But it ain't the way that you want
I'll be damned if this old man
Don't start to counting his losses
But it's still alright
They say you learn a lot out there
How to scorch and burn
Gonna have to bury your friends
And then you'll find it gets worse
Standing out on the ledge
With no way to get down
Start praying for wings to grow
Oh, baby, just let go
It ain't alright, you keep spinning out ahead
It was cold outside when I hit the ground
Say, I could sleep here, forget all the fear
It will take time to grow
Maybe, I don't know
Hey, tonight, if you think about it again
Remembering all the times that you pointed out
Say, the glass is clear, but all this fear
Starts a-leaving a mark
Your idle hands are all that stands
From your time in the dark
But it's still alright

You put your hands on the wrong damn man this time
Jezebel
You're bound for Hell
But evidently the devil's busy
So I moved you up in line
Martha Divine
Well you call him darling
And I call him daddy
And daddy says he'll whup me if I don't keep mama happy
Honor thy father
Honor thy mother
Lord the Bible doesn't say a damn thing about your daddy's lover

My daddy  isn't
Looks like a little more of him rubbed off on me than didn’t
Well I'll leave you to it
They'll never prove it
And if they ever find out, I'll say, ""The Devil made me do it""

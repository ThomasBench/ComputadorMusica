0,As Long As The Grass Shall Grow,Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/as-long-as-the-grass-shall-grow-chords-2749551,"     As long,  As the moon shall rise,     As long,  As the rivers,  Flow
     As long,  As the sun will shine,       As long,  As the grass shall grow
     The Senecas are an Indian tribe of the Iroquios Nation
     Down on the New York Pennsylvania Line, You'll find their reservation
     After the US Revolution,  Corn Planter was the chief
     He told the tribe, These men they could trust,  That was his true belief
     He went down to Independance Hall, And there was a treaty signed
     That promised peace with the USA,  And Indian rights combined
     George Washington gave his signature,  The government gave its hand
     They said that now and forever more,  That this was Indian land
     As long,  As the moon shall rise,     As long,  As the rivers,  Flow
     As long,  As the sun will shine,       As long,  As the grass shall grow
     On the Seneca reservation,  There is much sadness now
     Washingtons Treaty has been broken,  And there is no hope now
     Across the Allegheny River,  They're throwing up a dam
     It will flood the Indian country,  A proud day for Uncle Sam
     It has broke the ancient treaty,  With a politicians grin
     It will drown the Indians graveyards,  Corn Planter can you swim
     The earth is Mother to the Senecas, They're trampling sacred ground
     Change the mint green earth,  To black mud flats,  As honour hobbles down
     As long,  As the moon shall rise,     As long,  As the rivers,  Flow
     As long,  As the sun will shine,       As long,  As the grass shall grow
     The Iroquois Indians used to rule,  From Canada way south
     But no-one fears the Indians now,  And smiles the liars mouth
     The Senecas hired an expert,  To figure another site
     But the great good army engineers,  Said that he had no right
     Although he showed them another plan, And showed them another way
     They laughed in his face, And said no deal,  Kinuza Dam is here to stay
     Congress turned the Indians down,  Brushed off the Indians plea
     So the Senecas have renamed the dam,  They call it Lake Perfidy
     As long,  As the moon shall rise,     As long,  As the rivers,  Flow
     As long,  As the sun will shine,       As long,  As the grass shall grow
     Washington, Adams and Kennedy,  Now hear their pledges ring
     The treaties are safe, We'll keep our word,  But what is that gurgling
     It's a back water from Perfidy Lake,  It's rising all the time
     Over the homes, And over the fields,  And over the promises fine
     No boats will sail on Lake Perfidy,  In Winter it will fill
     In Summer it will be a swamp,  And all the fish will kill
     But the Government of the USA,  Has corrected Georges vow
     The father of our country must be wrong,  What's an Indian anyhow
     As long,  As the moon shall rise,     As long,  As the rivers,  Flow
     As long,  As the sun will shine,       As long,  As the grass shall grow

1,Delias Gone (ver 4),Johnny Cash,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johnny-cash/delias-gone-chords-1240213,"Delia, oh, Delia Delia all my life
If I hadn't have shot poor Delia
I'd have had her for my wife
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
I went up to Memphis
And I met Delia there Found her in her parlor
And I tied to her chair
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
She was low down and trifling
And she was cold and mean
Kind of evil make me want to Grab my sub machine
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
First time I shot her I shot her in the side
Hard to watch her suffer
But with the second shot she died
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
But jailer, oh, jailer jailer,
I can't sleep 'Cause all around my bedside
I hear the patter of Delia's feet
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone
So if you woman's devilish
You can let her run
Or you can bring her down and do her
Like Delia got done
Delia's gone, one more round Delia's gone

And bought some store bought cat food for that mean eyed cat.

thing on her side of the bed I found a little old note where her head belonged
It said, ""Dear John, honey, baby, I'm long gone.""
When I heard a whistle blowin', and the big wheels a-turnin' I was scared as I could be
I put on my overalls and I headed to town Gonna bring her back with me.
I asked the man down at the station if he had seen her there I told him all about
her pretty eyes and long, blonde hair He spit his tobacco, said, ""I'll be dad
blamed...... I b'lieve I did see her leavin' on the east bound train.""
I bought a round trip ticket on the east bound train I was broke as I could be
But when I come back, I gotta buy another ticket, gonna bring her back with me.
Well, I got off the train somewhere in Arkansas And I worked up the guts to call
my Mother-In-Law She said, ""I'll tell you where she is, if you act right.""
""She's workin' four to twelve at Trucker's World tonight.""

18,Cottonwood Tree,Marty Robbins,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/marty-robbins/cottonwood-tree-chords-2668122,"I rode into Tucson three hours ago
For supplies and a short friendly game
Of poker while Smitty put some new shoes
On old Dan before he goes lame
I sat in a game at the Miner's Saloon
Soon I had doubled my stake
The cards run like they'd been dealt by Lady Luck
They were just sealing my fate
A young cowboy lost more than he could afford
And accused me of dealing too smart
His draw was too slow and he fell to the floor
With three bullets close to the heart
Oh cottonwood tree are you waiting for me
Waiting to take me away
I've done no wrong but the town cannot see
And so with my life I must pay
A crowd started gathering the sheriff came in
I handed him over my gun
Was then when I found out the boy I had killed
Was the town's biggest man's only son
I tried to explain I had shot in defense
It was the young cowboy or me
The crowd wouldn't listen so they drug me out
To the limb of this cottonwood tree
Majestically standing out here all alone
It's spring and the valley is green
But I can't admire a place I don't belong
To me it's all like a bad dream
But old Dan's beneath me with new shoes and all
As they place the noose round my neck
Cowboys I've never laid eyes on before
Are tying my hands to my back
Oh cottonwood tree are you waiting for me
Waiting to take me away
I've done no wrong but the town cannot see
And so with my life I must pay
I see hate in the eyes of the town's biggest man
As he pulls a branch from the tree
To whip the backside of my old pony Dan
So he'll run out from under me
Insane he won't listen to my last appeal
A wild grin has covered his face
As I tried to reason just how he would feel
If he were up here in my place
There's many a mountain trail I'll never ride
Green valleys I'll never see
A young cowboy died and a man's foolish pride
Brought me to this cottonwood tree
My face is turned upward and I cannot breathe
The sky's growing dark overhead
The knot's pulling tight as my body sweeps free
A few moments more I'll be dead
Oh cottonwood tree were you put here for me
Put here to take me away
I've done no wrong but the town cannot see
And so with my life I must pay

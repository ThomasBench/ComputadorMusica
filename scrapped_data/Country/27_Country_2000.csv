0,I Will Forever Hate Roses,Dolly Parton,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/dolly-parton/i-will-forever-hate-roses-chords-2113389,"I used to love it when roses would come
The card always read, ""You're my number one""
But love never goes the way one supposes
And I will forever hate ros- es
You sent me roses, I thought it was nice
Opened the card and it read, ""Good- bye""
You're movin' on as this chapter closes
And I will forever hate ros- -es
I'll never see a rose from now on
That will not remind me that you're real- -ly gone
Don't trust the rose for the danger it poses
I will for- ever hate ros- -es
The fragrance of roses will last throughout time
Their beauty will linger, but not in my mind
No, I'll love the daisies, the tulips, the posies
But I will forever hate ros- -es
And I'll never see a rose from now own
That will not remind me that you're real- ly gone
Oh, and don't trust the rose for the pain it im- poses
I will for- ever hate ros- es
Now you're movin' on as this chapter closes
And I will for- ever hate ros- es
Yes, I will for- ever hate ros- -es

Until her landlord showed up with two hundred dollar bills
A notice of eviction on the other hand
Now she don't live there no more and everyone thinks she drowned
I pulled into Mecklenburg on them trains
Into a station that was flooded when they opened up the dams
And broke their connections to the railway lines
So they could blast into the quarry for every load of granite
We got a ton, don't worry
One night at the diner, over eggs
Over easy, she showed me the length of her legs
But that gold plated cross on her neck it was real
And you don't get that kind of money from pushing the meal
I shouldh've told him that you were the one for me
But I lied, but I lied
To most any drifter who's looking for work is too weird
I met your sister and I married her in July
But if only to be closer to you, Caroline
Percy and I moved down the street
Until we lost two pretty girls one was seven and one was three
Alderman and Caroline owned the house right up the hill
Where we laid those babies down so they could still see our house
Suspicion got the best of old Alderman Haint
He owned an auto parts store off the interstate
But the Lord took him home in July
And then Rose spilled the beans on the day that he died and we were in trouble
I shouldh've told him that you were the one for me
But I lied, but I lied
Tied up too concrete at the bottom of the quarry
With a tattoo on his heart that spelled out Caroline
He was silent, but his rosary
Well it drifted into custody
Of a sheriff that was just deputised
And I was down at the banquet hall
Where two guys came up, pretty angry and drunk
And I'm still here at the banquet hall, at the banquet hall
Where the gun went off in the Carolina Rain
In the Carolina rain
In the Carolina rain
Oh, Caroline

Like a firecracker waiting to blow
Breakin? like a rocket who was making
His way To the cities of Mexico
Lived in an apartment out on Avenue A
I Had a tar-hut on the corner of Tenth
Had myself a lover who was finer than gold
But I?ve broken up and busted up since
And Love don?t play any games with me Any-
More like she did before???..
World won?t wait so I better shake that
Thing right out there through the door
Hell I still love you New
York???
Found myself a picture that would fit in the folds
Of my wallet and it stayed pretty good
Still amazed I didn?t lose it on the roof of the
Place when I was drunk and I was thinking of you
Every day the children they were singing their tunes
Out on the streets and you could hear from the inside
Used to take the subway up to Houston and Third
I would wait for you and I?d try to hide
And Love won?t play any games with you any-
More if you don?t want it to?..
The World won?t wait and I watched you shake but
Honey I don?t blame you
Hell, I still love you New
York??
??????.?Hell I still Love you New
York??????????.New?
York????????????.
I remember Christmas in the blistering cold
In a church on the Upper West Side
Babe, I stood there singing I was holding your arm
You were holding my trust like a child
Found a lot of trouble out on Avenue B
But I tried to keep the overhead low
Farewell to the city and the love of my life
At least we left before we had to go
And Love won?t play any games with you any
More if you don?t want ?em to
So we better shake this old thing out the door I?ll
Always be thinking of you I?ll always love you though New

Without knowing where
We started from
It's  true    I'm missing you
As I stand alone in your room
Everyday that will pass you by
Every name that you won't recall
Everything that you made by hand
Everything that you know by heart
And I will try to connect
All the pieces you left
I will carry it on
And let you forget
And I'll remember the years
When your mind was clear
How the laughter and life
Filled up this silent house
One room
Two single beds
In the closet hangs
Your favorite dress
The books   that you read
Are in scattered piles
Of paper shreds
Everything that you made by hand
Everything that you know by heart
I will try to connect
All the pieces you left
I will carry it on
And let you forget
And I'll remember the years
When your mind was clear
How the laughter and life
Filled up this silent house

In the garden   off the living room
A chill fills the air
And the lilies bloom
And I will try to connect

 Smoke and mirrors, somebody stole you away
 Well that's the biggest conspiracy since JFK
 So I combed the corners and the glass houses
 Had the right directions but I never found it

 Nobody testify, not a single witness

 And the sheriff shined his light like I was drunk and dangerous
 My hands were already tied, so he put away his handcuffs
 And in my blind spot I saw the silhouette
 Of your crazy legs smokin' a long black cigarette

And I will pledge with mine;
Or leave a kiss within the cup,
And I'll not ask for wine.
The thirst that from the soul doth rise,
Doth crave a drink divine;
But might I of Jove's nectar sup,
I would not change for thine.
I sent thee late a rosy wreath,
Not so much honoring thee
As giving it a hope that there
It could not withered be;
But thou thereon didst only breathe
And sent'st it back to me,
Since when it grows and smells, I swear,
Not of itself, but thee.

  Let us pause in life pleasures,  And count its many tears
  While we all sup sorrow,  With the poor
  There's a song that will linger, Forever in our ears
  Oh, Hard times,   Come again no more
  It's a song,  A sigh, Of the weary
  Hard times, Hard times,  Come again no more
  Many days you have lingered,  Around my cabin door
  Oh, Hard times,  Come again no more
  While we seek mirth and beauty,  And, Music light and gay
  There are frail forms,  Fainting at the door
  Though their voices now are silent, Their pleading looks still say
  Oh, Hard times,  Come again no more

  Hard times, Hard times,  Come again no more
  Many days you have lingered,  Around my cabin door
  Oh, Hard times,  Come again no more
  There's a pale drooping maiden,  Who toils her life away
  With a worn heart,  Whos better days are o'er
  Though her voice should be merry,  It's singing all the day
  Oh, Hard times,   Come again no more
  It's a song,  A sigh, Of the weary
  Hard times, Hard times,  Come again no more
  Many days you have lingered,  Around my cabin door
  Oh, Hard times,  Come again no more
  It's a sigh that has wafted,  Across the troubled wave
  It's a wail,  That is heard upon the shore
  It's a dirge, That is murmered,  Around the lowly grave

And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleepin' bag
And it's knowin' I'm not shackled
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line
That keeps you in the back roads
By the rivers of my memory
It's not clingin' to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or some-thing that somebody said be-cause
It's just knowing that the world
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're movin' on the back roads
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us
And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
I still might run in silence
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see
I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin' cracklin' cauldron
In some train yard
My beard a rustlin' coal pile
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend to hold you to my breast and find
That you're waitin' from the back roads

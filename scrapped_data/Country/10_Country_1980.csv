You’re not a kid at thirty-three.
You play around you'll lose your wife.

Where the smoke is hangin' still
Like an echo of an age long forgotten
There's a story of a home
Crushed beneath those blackened stones
And the roof that fell before the beams were rotten
Cecil Darby loved his wife
And he labored all his life
To provide her with material possessions
And he built for her a home
Of the finest wood and stone
And the building soon became his sole obsession
Oh it took 300 days
For the timbers to be raised
And the silhouette was seen from miles around
And the gables reached as high
As the eagles in the sky
But it only took one night to bring it down
When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground
Though they shared a common bed
There was precious little said
In the moments that were set aside for sleepin'
For his busy dreams were filled
With the rooms he'd yet to build
And he never heard young Helen Darby weepin'
Then one night he heard a sound
As he layed his pencil down 
And he traced it to her door and turned the handle
And the pale light of the moon
Through the window of the room
Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled
 Oh it took 300 days
 For the timbers to be raised
 And the silhouette was seen from miles around
 And the gables reached as high
 As the eagles in the sky
 But it only took one night to bring it down
 When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground

Beneath the Tennessee silver moon we found a feeling we could share
And age made no difference I'd been around and she was young
And my first taste of Texas still lingers in my heart and on my tongue
Her gentle heart was broken in a way a tender lady shouldn't have to know
And mine was somewhere in between somethin' I should hold on to or let go
Her talkin' blue eyes told me the story of the love she failed to find
And without conversation I suppose the lines on my face told her mine

I spent two or three in New York City

Sometimes when it just don't make no sense
Yeah he gets off on country music

A lady down on love, and out of hope and dreams.
The ties that once bound her, now are broke away.
And she's like a baby, just learning how to play.
She never thought that love, could ever end so soon.
Her mind drifts back in time, to a mid-summer moon.
When he asked her to marry, and she gladly said “OK”.
And a woman came to be, from the girl of yesterday.
Now she's a lady, down on love.
She needs somebody, to gently pick her up.
She's got her freedom, but she'd rather be bound,
To a man who would love her, and never let her down.
Well I know the lady, that's down on her love.
Cause I used to hold her, and have that special touch.
But work took me away, from home late at nights.
And I wasn't there, when she turned out the lights.
Then both of us got lonely, and I gave into lust.
And she just couldn't live, with a man she couldn't trust.
Now she's a lady, down on love.
She needs somebody, to gently pick her up.
She's got her freedom, but she'd rather be bound,
To a man who would love her, and never let her down.
Now she's a lady,     Down on love.

You gotta take that first step..ask her out and treat her like a lady.
Second step, tell her she's the one you were dreaming of.
Third step, take her in your arms and never let her go.

46,To Love Is To Bury,Cowboy Junkies,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/cowboy-junkies/to-love-is-to-bury-chords-1103853,"I buried him down by the river
'Cause thats where he liked to be.
And every night when the moon is high
I go there and weep openly.
He and I were married 
By the river 'neath this willow tree
And with God and friends witnessing on
He pledged his life to me
To me he was earth, I rooted in his soil.
I to he was sky vast and free
Of the burdens from which he toiled.
Then one night a terrible fight
Words spoken better left unsaid.
With his wedding vows ringing in my ears
He gave his life to me.
They say to love is to bury
Those demons from which we all hide,
But tonight by this river 'neath this willow tree
Becoming one are earth and sky.

47,If These Old Walls Could Speak,Glen Campbell,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/glen-campbell/if-these-old-walls-could-speak-chords-1801340,"If these old walls, if these old walls could speak.
What a tale they have to tell, parties and people raisin'hell
A couple in love livin' week to week.
Rooms full of laughter, if these  walls could speak.
 If these old halls, if hallowed halls could talk.
These would have a tale to tell, the sun goin' down and dinner bells.
Children playin' at hide and seek.
From floor to rafters, if these old Halls could speak.
They would tell you that I'm sorry.
For bein' and cold and blind and weak.
They would tell you that it's only that I have a stubborn streak.
If these walls could speak.
If these old fashioned window panes were eyes.
I guess they would have seen it all.
Each little tear and silent footfall.
And every dream that we came to seek,
Or followed after, if these old walls could speak.
They would tell you that I owe you,
More that I could ever pay.
Here's someone who really loves you,
Don't ever go away.
That's what these walls would say.

48,Someday Soon,Moe Bandy,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/moe-bandy/someday-soon-chords-1740221,"There's a young girl that I know, she just turned twenty-one
Comes from down in southern Colorado
I just got out of the service and I'm looking for my fun
Someday soon she'll go with me, someday soon
Her parents can not stand me cause I work the rodeo
They say that he's the kind to leave you crying
But I know she'll follow me down any road I go
Someday soon she'll go with me someday soon
When I visit her, her paw aint got one good word to say,
Guess its cause he was just as wild back in his early days
So blow you old blue northern, blow me on my way, 
I'm driving back, from California
I love those danged old rodeos as much as I love her
Someday soon she'll go with me Someday soon
When I visit her, her paw aint got one good word to say
Guess it's cause he was just as wild back in his early days
So blow you old blue northern, blow me on my way
I'm driving back, from California
I love those danged old rodeos as much as I love her, 
Someday soon she'll go with me, someday soon
Someday soon she'll go with me Someday soon

  Gets a winning hand,  now and then
  Once in a while, the angels smile
  And someones life,  turns out just right
  Now and then dreams come true
  When someone like me is loved by someone like you
  So many times I just couldn't help believe in
  I'd never find, the one to make my life worth living
  But now and then miracles still happen
  Oh I know they do   cause I found you
  It'll always be   a mystery
  That in all this world   you chose me
  It's good to know   that now and then
  It all turns around and there's really a rainbows end

He spoke very few words but he made ''em count

Had not fate, cheated him, of his prize

From this guy who'd been busted so bad
It''s better to ride even if you get throwed

Here we go once again
You've been gone and here you stand
With a dozen ""I'm sorrys"" in your hand
Victim of your potent charms 
I took you back with open arms  
But along with the roses came the thorns
And that's why   red roses just won't work now 
'Cause you've done too much to talk things out 
You could tell me you love me
But that's the one thing I'll always doubt 
Red roses just won't work now
Gone for good's the trust I had
You led me down the garden path  
Just too many times to take you back
So faithless lover why don't you
Save the roses for you know who 
I already know how long they'll last
And that's why   red roses just won't work now 
'Cause you've done too much to talk things out 
You could tell me you love me
But that's the one thing I'll always doubt 
Red roses just won't work now
No darling, red roses just won't work now

He didn't have too much to say
Then with a move of his eyes
A move that could have made the wind stand still
He took my hand in his and said the words
That I never will forget
He said have you ever cheated on me
Has there been someone else
Is there someone you love more than me
Someone you can't forget
If his memory is opened again
Let it be chased away by time
He said have you ever cheated on me-
I said only in my mind
How can I tell him,  the time we spent together 
Was time between friends
That I can't just talk with him
How can I tell you
That somewhere in the cards it was meant for us to be
Why am I blushing in front of you now
Is it you or the heat
Darling have you ever cheated on me

And now, he wishes he could stop himself

So he lays down with his lover
In his heart and soul
He knew he was playin? a game he could never win
But ya know, forbidden fruit is sweet
Why it was sweet enough to make him risk it all again
And now, he?s given up on lookin?
for a way to fight the feelin?

47,Time Dont Run Out On Me,Anne Murray,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/anne-murray/time-dont-run-out-on-me-chords-941458,"Time, don't run out on me..gotta make you love me the 
way you used to do.
Gotta get back the feeling and put wind in my sails,
and chart a course that gets me back to you, back to you.
Oh, the lonely days, the lonely nights, lookin' back in time..
time, don't run out on me.
I've gotta get back to where we used to be..
where we used to be.
Time...don't run out on me, don't run out on me.
There's one more thing I gotta do before I pack it in.
Gotta make the right moves, say the right thing to change 
And find a way to get you back again, back again.
All the wasted time, the lonely nights lookin' back in time..
time, don't run out on me.
I've gotta get back to where we used to be.. 
where we used to be..time...don't run out on me.
Once I could catch your eye across the room..
and know just what you were thinkin'.
And when I held you in my arms, we'd dream as one..
but those days are gone, somethin' went wrong..
and when I wake up to the mornin' sun, I find myself sayin'...
Time, don't run out on me, don't run out on me, 
don't run out on me.
Time, don't run out on me..time, don't run out on me.
I've gotta get back to where we used to be..
where we used to be.
Time..don't run out on me.
Time, don't run out on me.....Time, don't run out on me.(x4)(Fade.)

49,A Little Good News (ver 2),Anne Murray,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/anne-murray/a-little-good-news-chords-1776633,"I rolled out this morning kids had the morning news show on
Bryant Gumbel was talking bout the fighting in Lebanon
Some senator was squawking about the bad economy
It's gonna get worse you see we need a change in policy
There's a local paper rolled up in a rubber band
One more sad story's one more than I can stand 
Just once how I'd like to see the headline say
Not much to print today  can't find nothing bad to say
Nobody robbed a liquor store on the lower part of town
Nobody OD'd  nobody burned a single building down
Nobody fired a shot in anger nobody had to die in vain
We sure could use a little good news today
I'll come home this evening I'll bet that the news will be the same
Somebody takes a hostage somebody steals a plane
How I wanna hear the anchor man talk about a county fair 
And how we cleaned up the air how everybody learned to care
Whoa tell me nobody was assassinated in the whole good world today
And in the streets of Ireland all the children had to do was play
And everybody loves everybody in the good old USA
We sure could use a little good news today 
Nobody robbed a liquor store on the lower part of town
Nobody OD'd  nobody burned a single building down
Nobody fired a shot in anger nobody had to die in vain
We sure could use a little good news today

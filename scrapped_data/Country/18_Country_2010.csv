I know how this one ends
It's a phone call from someplace far away
You say you've found yourself
Oh in someone else
And she makes you forget about the rain
Her eyes are a golden hue
And everything you knew
Slips away at the hem of her dress
As I was passing by
That old mountainside
It turned to dust at my feet
So I am incomplete
So loud and so discreet
You try to pinpoint me, I guess that was your mistake
Too much whiskey
Too much honey, too much wine
I learned some thngs never heal with time
I've been waiting here
Feels like a million years
And I'm a photograph that you forgot you took
But I remember spring
I remember everything
Oh, I guess that's the way it goes
La la la....

But I've failed here to find it, so I must travel on;
I don't care for fine mansions on earth's sinkin' sand
Lord, build me a cabin in the corner of glory land
Yes, build me just a cabin in the corner of glory land
In the shade of the tree of life that it may ever stand
Where I can just hear the angels sing and shake Jesus' hand
Lord, build me a cabin in the corner of glory land
Blessed Lord, I'm not asking to live in the midst
For I know I'm not worthy of such splendor as this
But I'm asking for mercy while humbly I stand
Lord, build me a cabin in the corner of glory land
I have many loved ones who have gone on this way
On that great final morning shall I hear them say
Come and join in the singin' and play in our band
Lord, build me a cabin in the corner of glory land

They wanna know what's up when I'm still holding ya
Even when the song is over

Stirring up our little town the last week or two

I feel it, don't you feel it too?

We could really give them something to talk about

Didn't see no use in sticking around

I was sitting on G, waiting on O

Talked a little too much about the rest of our lives

Waving goodbye to Your neighbor

Chasing dreams that You'd been dreaming

So much left I have to learn
Grandpa's shaking off His cancer
Just in case You hadn't heard

Barely making out Your name
Said You got some fancy hair due
My Mommas gone insane
Daddy left no goodbye letter
With no pistol on His grave
In the backyard on the blacktop
Where He left them good old days

Got too much lager   stuck behind my eyes,

Every day people are trying to find,
Their perfect train to get them where they're going on time,
For me, that's the hardest thing I've ever known,
So watch for me walking down that big open road,
If I don't pay attention I'll be a slave to my mind,
Don't need to wait for all my stars to align,
The silver dollar moon is the same as mine,
She wants to hear it speak, but I just let it shine.
And as the tops of the trees turn from golden to green,
And the river sighs softly to her,

Well, sometimes you got to break from this world,
Sometimes a pretty girl does enough,

He could outrun the L&N
Caught a wild cat and made him his friend
He was a flat woods boy
Caught his learnin' from a runnin' brook
Taught him go with the flow and don't get hooked
But Virgil Lee kindly mistook
The devil for a dear friend
You can fool all the jokers with diamonds
You can playboy ramblin' roots
You can lie like a penny on the CNO line
But the good Lord knows the truth
Just like a old hickory
Shadin' the porch of a house that's been torn down
There ain't nothin' that's left but the memory
And that long, tall, scraggily, bitter nut old hickory
It was Gainsboro at the Glow Worm Bar
We were passin' around a jug and a guitar
Virgil picked it like an Opry star
I mean the boy was on fire
I said, ""Hey Virgil Lee, where'd you get that stuff?""
He said, ""I don't know, I guess I made it up?""
Well sometimes an empty cup
Just overflows
And all that summer was fire and rain
Virgil Lee started nursin' the pain
Was twisted, falling down
Like a old hickory
Shadin' the porch of a house that's been torn down
There ain't nothin' that's left but the memory
And that long, tall, scraggily, bitter nut old hickory
Laid him out in his overalls
'Cause when you get too big for your breeches well that's all
Hung his fiddle and his flat top guitar
Up in the high school gym
Nobody remembers his name
And I can't say anyone's to blame

It's not the four walls movin' in that tortures me
It's not the cold cement or shivers down my spine
It's just the visions in my head that make me paranoid
And wonder if I get out will you be mine
I never should have treated you
so bad my love I'm sorry
I'm broken, now I can see that now it's true
My picket fence is turning razor wire
And now I'm awaiting trial
Things you have to know I did not do
If I could get a word with you I'd be just fine
Or any envelope with both your name and mine
We'd be enough to keep me going
In a world where I'm left knowing that
There's something more to live for just outside

Though I've had bad days, this has to be my worst

Since it rested on your shoulder
While we walked along that vacant river side
They carried me away
To a place where I get older
If I cannot prove to them you never died

It’s like I’m sitting at a bus stop

is hard to explain
My heart’s in the right place
what’s left of it I guess
My heart ain’t the problem
it’s my mind that’s a total mess
With these rickety old legs
and these watery eyes
It’s hard to believe
that I could pass for anybody’s prize
And here’s what I know about
the gifts that God gave
You can’t take em with you
when you go to the grave
It ain't over yet ask someone who ought to know
not so very long ago we were both hung out to dry
It ain't over yet you can mark my words
Don't care what you think you heard we’re still learning how to fly
It’ aint over yet
For fools like me
who were built for the chase
It takes the right kind of woman
to help you put it all in place
It only happened once in my life
but man you should have seen
Her hair two shades of foxtail red
her eyes some far out sea blue green
I got caught up making a name for myself
you know what that’s about
One day your ship comes rolling in
the next day it just rolls back out
And you can’t take for granted
none of this shit
The higher up you fly boys
the harder it is you’re gonna get hit
It ain't over yet  I’ll say this about that
you can get up off the mat or you can lay there til you die
It ain't over yet here’s the truth my friend
you can’t pack it in and we both know why
It ain't over yet
Silly boys blind to get there first think of
second chances as some kind of curse
I’ve known you for-ever and ever
If you came by it easy you wouldn’t be you
You make me laugh you make me cry you make me forget myself
Back when down on my luck
kept me up for days
You were there with the right words
to help me crawl out of the maze
When I’d almost convinced myself
I was hipper than thou
You stepped up with a warning shot
fired sweet and low across the bow
And you don’t walk on water
and your sarcasm stings
But the way you move through this old world
sure makes a case for angel wings
And I was half way to the bottom
when you threw me that line
And I’ll quote you now verbatim
Get your head out of your own behind
It ain't over yet what you wanna bet
one more cigarette ain't gonna send you to the grave
It ain't over yet I seen your new girlfriend
thinks you’re the living end big old sparkle in her eye
It ain't over yet

No matter what the papers say
He worked 'til he bled for everything he had
Brought us up to do the same
One afternoon in June
He had us workin' just like a couple mules
My cousin and me were twenty feet deep
And covered in red mud clay
Well we ran pipe from the creek bed
Through the woods to the old grey shack
It was worth the trouble to work them shovels
For granddaddy's sour mash stash
All the weeds and pecan trees hid a secret
We all swore to keep
Well my granddaddy knew what the law would do
If they ever come snoopin' 'round back
Lord I'm down in the gulley
Where the creek is high
Lord I'm down in the gulley
Where only the moon shines
Without money you can't buy nothin'
And nothin' is a damned ol' shame
When you're in the hole
You'd sell your soul for runnin' water instead of rain
Well the hills were filled with the smell of cash
Cookin' in the copper still
Everybody knew where they get their brew
And that made our family name
Lord I'm down in the gulley
Where the creek is high
Lord I'm down in the gulley
Where only the moon shines
Well years and laws passed by
They couldn't keep the county dry
One night, the sheriff went to lookin'
For the man who was cookin' that bootleg moonshine
Well he called the press
And he brought his best to tear our old shack down
But when they went for the stash my granddaddy laughed
For the shack was a pump house
Lord I'm down in the gulley

Where only the moon shines
It was down in the gulley

Funny how seeing you once after a few months gets you locked out
Right back to telling folks you know I know all about some new guy taking you out
Then you unfollow me and follow me back just so I know you're still around

Take a trip back home, pretend they never knew the guy
Some girls drink a bottle of wine
Got an old ex to text to get 'em through the getting by
Sometimes it's a clean break, stay gone, clean slate
Sometimes some girls make it easy on you
Some girls never do
Some hearts stay broke
Some hearts don't skip a beat
Some people say goodbye then try to make it alright

48,Moonlight Motel (ver 2),Bruce Springsteen,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bruce-springsteen/moonlight-motel-chords-2728131,"There's a place on a blank stretch of road where
Nobody travels and nobody goes and the
Deskman says these days 'round here
Where two young folks could probably up and disappear into
Rustlin' sheets, a sleepy corner room
  Into the musty smell
Of wilted flowers and lazy afternoon hours
At the Moonlight Motel
Now the pool's filled with empty, eight foot deep
Got dandelions growin' up through the cracks in the concrete
Chain-link fence half-rusted away
Got a sign, says, ""Children, be careful how you play""
Your lipstick taste and your whispered secret
I promised I'd never tell
A half-drunk beer and your breath in my ear
At the Moonlight Motel
Well then, it's bills and kids and kids and bills
And the ringing of the bell
Across the valley floor through the dusty screen door
Of the Moonlight Motel
Last night I dreamed of you, my lover
And the wind blew through the window and blew off the covers
Of my lonely bed, I woke to something you said
That it's better to have loved, yeah, it's better to have loved
As I drove, there was a chill in the breeze
And leaves tumbled from the sky and fell
On a road so black as I backtracked
To the Moonlight Motel
She was boarded up and gone like an old summer song
Nothing but an empty shell
I pulled in and stopped into my old spot
I pulled a bottle of Jack out of a paper bag
Poured one for me and one for you as well
Then it was one more shot poured out onto the parking lot
To the Moonlight Motel

49,Count Your Blessings,Mattiel,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/mattiel/count-your-blessings-chords-2830120,"Your shoes keep turning different shades of blue
The colors of the other fools before you
And skin keeps turning different shades of red
The colors of the other voice that's swimming in your head
Make yourself at home again
Count your blessings, one to ten
Your body will be whole again, Your body will be whole again
Make yourself at home again
Count your blessings, one to ten
Your hands keep turning lighter shades of white
The color of the temperature that's dropping every night
Your pair of shoes are turning back to black
The color of the inner voice that's slowly coming back
Make yourself at home again
Count your blessings, one to ten
Your body will be whole again, Your body will be whole again
Make yourself at home again
Count your blessings, one to ten

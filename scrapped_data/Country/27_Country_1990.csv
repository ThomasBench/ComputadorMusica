0,You Think You Know Somebody (ver 2),Todd Snider,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/todd-snider/you-think-you-know-somebody-chords-1048701,"You think you know somebody.
You think they know you.
You think you know somebody.
But man you never do.
Jackie used to live three blocks away from me
We used to throw the baseball and we’d climb his old oak tree
And we would sneak his old man's cigarettes behind the picket fence
We swore that  we would always be the best of friends
We used to sit out on the curb and talk on summer nights,
Until Jackie's daddy’d call him, and then he took off like a light

1,Belleau Wood (ver 2),Garth Brooks,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/garth-brooks/belleau-wood-chords-2115901,"Oh  the  snowfakes fell in  silence 
Over Belleau Wood that night 
For a  Christmas truce had been declared 
    By     both sides of the fight 
As we     lay there in our trenches 
The        silence broke in  two 
By a  German soldier singing 
 A    song that we all   knew
Though I did not know the   language
The  song was ""Silent  Night"" 
Then I heard my buddy      whisper, 
  ""All is  calm, and all is bright"" 
Then the  fear and   doubt surrounded me 
'Cause I'd die if I was      wrong 
But I stood up in    trench 
And I began to sing  a - long
Then across the frozen battlefield 
A - nother's voice joined in 
until one by one each man became 
A singer of the hymn 
Then  I  thought that I was dreaming 
For right there in my sight 
       Stood the German    soldier 
'Neath the falling flakes of white 
And raised his hand and smiled at me 
As         if  he seemed to  say 
Here's hoping we both live 
 To   find a better      way
Then the devil's clock struck midnight 
And the skies lit up a - gain 
And the battlefield where heaven stood 
Was blown to hell a - gain 
But for just one fleeting moment 
The answer seemed so clear 
Heaven's not be - yond the clouds 
It's just beyond the fear 
No Heaven's not beyond the clouds 
It's for us to find it here

said sit down, I got some bad news that's gonna hurt
Said I'm you best friend and you know that's right
But your young bride ain't home tonight
Since you've been gone she's been seeing that Amos boy, Seth
Now he got mad and he saw red
Andy said, Boy, don't you lose your head
Cause to tell you the truth, I've been with her myself

  That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods Southern lawyer
Cause the judge in the town's got blood stains on his hands

Walking on home cause he didn't live far
You see, Andy didn't have many friends and he just lost him one
Brother thought his wife must've left town
So he went home and finally found
the only thing Daddy left him and that was a gun
He went off to Andy's house
Slipping through the woods as quiet as a mouse
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make
He looked through the screen at the back porch door
And he saw Andy lying on the floor
In a puddle of blood, and he started to shake
The Georgia Patrol was making their rounds
so he fired a shot just to flag them down
A big bellied sheriff grabbed his gun and said
Why'd you do it?
The judge said guilty in a make believe trial
Slapped the sherrif on the back with a smile
And said suppers waiting at home and I got to get to it

to Andy's house and back that night were mine

The only girl I care about has gone away
Lookin' for a brand new start
But little does she know that when she left that day
Along with her she took my heart
Rain wont you tell her now does that seem fair
For her to take my heart away when she don't care
I can't love another when my heart's somewhere far away
Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
Telling me what a fool I've been
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain
And let me be alone again
Rain won't you tell her that I love her so
Please ask the sun to set her heart aglow
Rain in her heart and let the love we know start to grow
Listen to the rhythm of the falling rain
Telling me what a fool I've been
I wish that it would go and let me cry in vain
And let me be alone again
Listen to the rhythm

You never paid your half the rent
You took the spices from the rack
But you don't have to put 'em back
'Cause in your haste on Halloween
You left your camera on the bed
Where we played roles in black and white
You left a roll of black and white
I set the timer, thought of you
Put the lens up to my head
I took a photograph for you
What comes out gray is really red
So are  you...   happy now?
Are  you.....   happy now?
Are   you.... happy now?
I smashed your pumpkin on the floor
The candle flickered at my feet
As goblins flew across the moon
The children peered into the room
A cowboy shivered on the porch
And Cinderella checked her watch
A hobo waited in the street
An angel whispered trick or treat
What was I supposed to do
But to sit there in the dark
I was amazed to think that you
Would take the candy with you too
So are  you...   happy now?
Are  you.....   happy now?
Are   you.... happy now?
I've sat all night, and now it's dawn
And I cannot believe my eyes
There's garbage strewn across the lawn
Where we once stared up at the sky
And streams of paper fill the tree
That hovered over you and me
And shaving cream covers the car
That we picked up in Baltimore
And though I know it's hard to tell
I hope that what's-his-name treats you )well
I still maintain that he's a bum
But it's your money, have some fun
So are  you...   happy now?
Are  you.....   happy now?
Are   you.... happy now?
You always asked why I had not
Written you a verse or two
Since that's the one thing I regret
I dedicate this one to you
So are  you...   happy now?
Are  you.....   happy now?
Are   you......... ?

Slips me a hundred dollar bill says
""Charlie you best remember who your friends are""

You get used to anything
Sooner or later it just becomes your life

Mary's smiling but she's watching me out of the corner of her eye

In the basement hunting gun and a hacksaw
Sip a beer and thirteen inches of barrel drop to the floor
Come home in the evening, can't get the smell from my hands
Lay my head down on the pillow and
Go drifting off into foreign lands

Under the flag of the greenback dollar

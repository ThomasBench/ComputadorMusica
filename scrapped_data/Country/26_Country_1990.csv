0,Dream Walkin (ver 2),Toby Keith,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/toby-keith/dream-walkin-chords-1766235,"She left a yellow rose and a long neck bottle,
On a table beside my bed.
With a short little note that said I had a good time,
It was written in lipstick red.
She didn't sign her name I wonder,
If that a little secret that she keeps.
Ooo... she's walkin' around in my sleep.
Dream walkin', pillow talkin'.
She's callin' my name again.
Day's breakin' I ain't wakin' up, I'm sleepin' in.
I'm on a roll now, I gotta know how this dream ends.
She took my new sunglasses and my old jean jacket,
And she never even bothered to ask.
You could say I haven't seen her since late last summer,
But every night she comes back.
Just like smoke through the keyhole,
She slips in so silently.
Ooo... she's walkin' around in my sleep.
Dream walkin', pillow talkin'.
She's callin' my name again.
Day's breakin' I ain't wakin' up, I'm sleepin' in.
I'm on a roll now, I gotta know how this dream ends.
Ooo... there's a thin line between dreams and memories.
I'll be losin' my mind 'till she comes back to me.
     -----------
Dream walkin', pillow talkin'.
She's callin' my name again.
Day's breakin' I ain't wakin' up, I'm sleepin' in.
I'm on a roll now, I gotta know how this dream ends.
I'm on a roll now, I gotta know how this dream ends.
I'm on a roll now, I gotta know how this dream ends.

1,Days Between,Grateful Dead,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/grateful-dead/days-between-chords-833711,"   There were days
   and there were days
   and there were days between
   Summer flies and August dies
   the world grows dark and mean
   Comes the shimmer of the moon
   on black infested trees
   the singing man is at his song
   the holy on their knees
   The reckless are out wrecking
   The timid plead their pleas
   No one knows much more of this
   than anyone can see      can see
   There were days
   and there were days
   and there were days besides
   when phantom ships with phantom sails
   set to sea on phantom tides
   Comes the lightning of the sun
   on bright unfocused eyes
   the blue of yet another day
   a springtime wet with sighs
   a hopeful candle lingers
   in the land of lullabies
   where headless horsemen vanish
   with wild and lonely cries     lonely cries
   There were days
   and there were days
   and there were days I know
   when all we ever wanted
   was to learn and love and grow
   Once we grew into our shoes
   we told them where to go
   Walked halfway around the world
   on promise of the glow
   Stood upon a mountain top
   Walked barefoot in the snow
   Gave the best we had to give
   How much we'll never know    never know
   There were days
   and there were days
   and there were days between
   polished like a golden bowl
   The finest ever seen
   Hearts of Summer held in trust
   still tender, young and green
   left on shelves collecting dust
   not knowing what they mean
   Valentines of flesh and blood
   as soft as velveteen
   hoping love would not forsake
   the days that lie between      lie between

2,Come A Long Way,Michelle Shocked,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/michelle-shocked/come-a-long-way-chords-1885173,"I Kicked in his door at 5 A.M.
""I've come for my bike"" I told the repo man
My 920's gonna take me far today
You can travel for miles and never leave L. A.
I've come a long way, I've come a long way
I've gone 500 miles today
I've come a long way, I've come a long way
And never even left L. A.
I drive by the Plaza where the gay boys pose
Stand in their windows wearing no clothes
I heard the screams of the dying dark
Through the sweet green icing of MacArthur Park
And then I crossed the river into East L. A.
Pescado mojado me encontre
And I'm given up on rock 'n roll
And I'm saving up for norteño
The river she runs by the railroad tracks
I swear I'll never take it back
A train, she cries on the midnight hour
All along the Watts Tow---er   
Ohhhhhhhhhhh!!!
I've come a long way, I've come a long way
I've gone 500 miles today
I've come a long way, I've come a long way
And never even left L. A.
I darted down to San Pedro Bay
Watched my ship sail in, watched her sail away
The sun was sinking in-to the sea
But a ball of fire inside of me
Was burning my motor and driving me hard
Past the big hair on the Boulevard
And up Mulholland where I made the scene
Like the one that took little Jimmy Dean
And then I shimmied up Wilshire like a little silk worm
Past the rodeo and the pachyderm
And then I stopped for coffee at an art cafe
I saw the repo man and made my getaway
Doing the Eagle Rock, heading for the hills
Oh tried to let my engines cool
And it is not my fault that this town shakes
I saw the falling rock and I hit my brakes!
I've come a long way, I've come a long way
I've gone 500 miles today
I've come a long way, I've come a long way
And never even left L. A.
Now you tow it to the repo man's front door
And you give him these keys, I don't need 'em no more
You tow it to the repo man's front door
And you give him these keys, I don't need 'em no more...
I've come a long way, I've come a long way
I've gone 500 miles today
I've come a long way, I've come a long way
And never even left L. A. ...

Blackberry blossom when the summertime came?
The blackberry blossom, oh the last time I saw one
Was down in the bramble where I rambled in the spring
The bramble was wild I was torn by the briars
My love he wooed me as I lie there
With a flower in my hair and my cheeks all flashy
Was the Blackberry Blossom from the Blackberry Bush
When I picked the berry I didn't miss the blossom
The blackberry blossom was white as the snow
But the berry that it brings is sweeter than molasses
And black as the wings of an Arkansas crow
The Arkansas crow is a devil and a demon
Known for his cackling and his screaming
Driving away the swallow and the thrush
From the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush
I was picking berries when that crow flew above me
Carrying my lover so far away
Now each spring I lay a blackberry blossom
By a cold gravestone on the Arkansas clay
The Arkansas clay is rocky and hard
With weeds growing over in the old graveyard
And the day settles down to an evening hush
Over the blackberry blossom and the blackberry bush.

I was wrong
Mistakes I've made and lived to tell
I tell them in a song
I knew a river wide and deep
Her banks were very tall
At one end was a mountain stream
The other was a waterfall, boys
The other was a waterfall
I asked the old man by the river
He did not recall
The last attempt to ride a barrel
Over the waterfall
The ferry boatman, he did tell me
That the chance was very small
None survived who went alive
Over the waterfall, boys
Over the waterfall
So I built myself an oaken barrel
And inside I did crawl
I broke the record but I broke my back
Going over the waterfall
And it's been my luck to live to tell
The only tale I can
It don't hurt you when you fall
Only when you land, boys
Only when you land

Back about eighteen and twenty-five
I left Tennessee very much alive
I never would've made it through the Arkansas mud
If I hadn't been riding on the Tennessee Stud
Had some trouble with my sweetheart's Pa
One of her brothers was a bad outlaw
I wrote a letter to my Uncle Bud
And I rode away on the Tennessee Stud
The Tennessee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a horse like Tennessee Stud
Rode right down into no man's land
Across that river called the Rio Grande
Raced my horse with the Spaniard's foe
Got me a skin full of silver and gold
Me and the gambler, we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee
Pulled our guns and he fell with a thud
And I rode away on a Tennessee Stud
The Tennessee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a horse like Tennessee Stud
Rode right back across Arkansas
I whipped her brother and I whipped her Pa
I found that girl with the golden hair
She was riding on a Tennessee Mare
Purty little baby on the cabin floor
Little horse colt playing round the door
I loved the girl with the golden hair
And the Tennessee Stud loves the Tennessee Mare
The Tennessee Stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood

He never hit the brakes
As he left the road
I found him lying in the grass
Among the steel and glass
With an empty whiskey bottle
by his side
And through the blood and tears
He whispered in my ear
A few last words
just before he died
Don't tell Mama I was drinkin'
Lord knows her soul would never rest
I can't leave this world with Mama thinkin'
I met the Lord  with whiskey on my breath
I still think about that night
And how that young man died
And how others sometimes pay
for our mistakes
The last thing on his mind
As he left this world behind
Was knowing someone else's
heart would break
Don't tell Mama I was drinkin'
Lord knows her soul would never rest
I can't leave this world with Mama thinkin'
I met the Lord  with whiskey on my breath
Don't tell Mama I was drinkin'

You loved me just so brutaly,
To have the bitter life wrung out of me.

And we're in this thing over our heads.

The hew and hollar, spit and scream.
Every one of them is sick with lust,
But every one of them will outlive us.
And if I really thought I could,
I'd give up your ghost for good,
But I'm not sure it isn't you...
That keeps my ghost from leaving too.
But I don't miss you half as much,

Another night just staring at the wall.
Last night's conversation knocked me off my feet
guess today I'll fall
I wish that we could find the words to look the other way
Be careful of the things we do and watch the things we say
And maybe then we'd get somewhere we'd never been before
But what's the use in fighting when you know you've lost the war.
Walk the streets in New Orleans, shirt soaked to my skin
Through the mess of yesterday's parade.
Thousand times a day I think of calling you again
Come to my senses instead.
And every time we walk away we lose a little time
Pretending to each other now that everything is fine
I know whatever lies I use to get myself to sleep
I wake up to the promises I know we couldn't keep.
Say you don't see what's wrong
Every night lasting oh so long,
And I know, I do, you're already gone.
I wonder should I get up, would but what's the point?
Oh once something's gone it's gone for good.
Maybe I could look away back to where we used to be,
One more time I wish I could.
Oh, nevermind the reasons that tore us all apart
We've both done things I know we can't defend.
What's the use in tracing it all back to the start
THere's something missing in the end.
I wish that we could find the words to look the other way

The news was out on the radio
That a shot was fired the night before
And a local man lay dead on the floor
And the dust was flying in the lumberyard
Lights were flashing on two black cars
I said, sheriff I ain't done nothing wrong
He just knocked me down and put the handcuffs on
I was framed, they took me away
Like I was the only one to blame
Framed, guilty they said
Railroaded me on a one way train
Framed, and on judgement day
They want me to hang my head in shame
But I was framed, and that's all I'll say
Now don't be running down my name
I was framed
Barbara Jo cried through the glass
At the murder trial I seen her last
I loved that woman but now she's free
She turned away when they sentenced me
And the guilty man ain't never told
Ten years later they put me on the road
And I'll always say that I got screwed
I'm a brand new man with the same attitude
I was framed, they took me away
Like I was the only one to blame
Framed, guilty they said
Railroaded me on a one way train
Framed, and on judgement day
They want me to hang my head in shame
But I was framed, and that's all I'll say
Now don't be running down my name
I was framed
Now the guilty man paid long ago
He's the same man who got laid low
When he took my wife he was hell bound
Even if I did gun him down
I was framed, they took me away
Like I was the only one to blame
Framed, guilty they said
Railroaded me on a one way train
Framed, and on judgement day
They want me to hang my head in shame
But I was framed, and that's all I'll say

You were dressed up fit to kill,
with a pretty girl on your arm
You spun around and you headed up town
Where the neon lights all shine
Left me choking in a cloud of dust
You never pay me no mind
You're livin' in the fast lane
I guess I'm just too slow
I never wore silk or fancy furs
Just plain ole calico
I'll never be a fast lane lover
And they're the only kind you take up town
I am just a country road
That you keep turnin' down
If you ever hit a dead end street
If it's love that you're looking for
You can always turn around
And beat a path right to my door
Do I have to draw you a map
You seem to know your way around
So when you're tired of spinnin' your wheels
Baby, we can go to town
You're livin' in the fast lane

Last I heard she had moved to Boulder but where she's now I don't know.
But there's something 'bout this time of year that spins my head around.
Takes me back, makes me wonder: What's she doing now?
'Cause what's she's doing now is tearin' me apart.
Fillin' up my mind and emptying my heart.
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows,
And I wonder if she knows--what she's doin' now.
Just for laughs I dialed her old number, but no one knew her name.
Hung up the phone, sat there and wondered if she'd ever done the same.
I took a walk in the evenin' wind to clear my head somehow.
But tonight I lie here thinkin' what's she doin' now?
'Cause what's she's doing now is tearin' me apart.
Fillin' up my mind and emptying my heart.
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows,
And I wonder if she knows-
That what's she's doing now is tearin' me apart.
Fillin' up my mind and emptying my heart.
I can hear her call each time the cold wind blows,
And I wonder if she knows--what she's doin' now.

I'll fold you in two and I'll carry you away 
to a place where your headwaters will flow 
clean through to your mouth. 
In return I'll request a small sanctuary
by her banks where we will live 
she will water our garden 
and clean the dirt from our skin.
As the world clamours at our door 
we will dance and not let them in.
And if one day we wake up to a bed dry as a bone 
find our river stolen find our sanctuary gone
we will stand and take stock and be grateful 
for what we've not lost.
We will pack up our bags, pack our small family 
head across the valley to where the aspen trees 
shiver as they ascend - 
the green hills rising to blue. 
At the edge of the chopping we will turn 
and bid fond adieu.
All that I know to true 
is the touch of your hand on my skin. 
One look from you can so easily soothe 
all this turmoil within. 
As we dance cheek to cheek 
with our feet so completely 
locked in a time all our own.
I stop to speak 
but you gently keep me 
moving in time to the song.
And in a voice that is sloppy with gin 
you say, let the world spin.
I'll fold you in two and I'll carry you away 
to a place where your headwaters will flow 
clean through to your mouth.

   Welcome to the new world order
  Families sleepin' in their cars in the Southwest  . . . .
  No home, no job, no peace, no rest
  Well, the highway is alive tonight  . . . .

  I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light   . . . .
   Searchin' for the ghost of Tom Joad
  He pulls a prayer book out of his sleeping bag   . . . .
  Preacher lights up a butt and takes a drag
  Waitin' for when the last shall be first
  And the first shall be last   . . . .
  In a cardboard box 'neath the underpass
  You got a one-way ticket to the promised land   . . . .
  You got a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand
  Sleeping on a pillow of solid rock   . . . .
   Bathin' in the city aqueduct
  Well, the highway is alive tonight  . . . .
   Where it's headed everybody knows
  I'm sittin' down here in the campfire light   . . . .
   Waitin' on the ghost of Tom Joad . . .
  . . Now Tom said,  . . . .
 ""Mom, wherever there's cop beatin' a guy  . . . .
  Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries
  Where there's a fight against the blood and hatred in the air . . . .
   Look for me, Mom. I'll be there . . .
  Wherever somebody's fightin' for a place to stand . . . .
  Or a decent job or a helping hand
  Wherever somebody's strugglin' to be free  . . . .
   Look in their eyes, Ma. You'll see me"" . . .
  Well, the highway is alive tonight  . . . .
But nobody's kiddin' nobody about where it goes

I just told my dad he's full of it, and I watched his face turn red.
And I should've said, ""I'm sorry"", but I matched him shout for shout,
I can still hear that screen door slammin', the night I called him out. 
He said, ""Son it's gonna hurt me, more than it hurts you"" 
but somehow I couldn't help but have my doubts.
Coz I'd seen my older brothers, crawl back in the house,
each time they called the old man out. 
Fist to fist and eye to eye, standin' toe to toe, 
He would've let me walk away, but I just would not let it go. 
Years of my frustration, had led me to this night, 
Now he'll pay for all the times that he's been right. 
He said, ""Son it's gonna hurt me, more than it hurts you"" 
but somehow I couldn't help but have my doubts.
Coz I'd seen my older brothers, crawl back in the house,
each time they called the old man out. 
It was over in a minute, that's when I realised 
The blood came from my mouth and nose, but the tears came from his eyes 
And in memory of that faithful night I know the greatest pain was his 
And I just pray someday I'm half the man he is. 
He said, ""Son it's gonna hurt me, more than it hurts you""

Just like my own dear brothers, I crawled back in the house 
The night I called the old man out.

One day it all disappeared 
And I'm lying in hotel room far away
Voices next door in my ear
Daytimes a drag , nighttimes worse
Hope that I can get home soon
But the half finished bottle of inspiration 
Lie like ghosts in my room
I want to go I know I can't stay
But I don't want to run feeling this way
Til,I     am myself ,
Til I      am myself
Til I      am myself again
Theres a seat on the corner I keep every night
Wait til the evening begins
I feel like a stranger from another world
But at least I'm living again
There are nights full of anger ,Words that are thrown
Tempers that are shattered and thin
And the moments of magic are just too short 
They're over before they begin
I know it's time ,one big step
I can't go I'm not ready yet
Til I      am myself ,
Til I      am myself 
Til I      am myself again
I had a dream that my house was on fire
People laughed while it burned
I tried to run but my legs were numb
I had to wait til the feeling returned
I don't need a doctor to figure it out 
I know what's passing me by
When I look in the mirror sometimes I see 
traces of some other guy
I want to go ,I know I can't stay
But I don't want to run feeling this way
Til I     am myself,
Til I     am myself 
Til I     am myself again

Illinois Central Monday mornin' rail
There's 15 cars, and 15 restless riders
3 conductors and 25 sacks of mail
All along a southbound oddyssey, and the train pulls out of Kankakee
And rolls along past the houses, farms and fields
Passin' towns that have no name, and freightyards full of old grey men
The graveyards of the rusted automobiles
Singin' good mornin' America, how are you?
Sayin' don't you know me?, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done.
I was playin' cards with the old men in the club car.
Penny a point, ain’t no one keepin' score
Pass the paper bag that holds that bottle.
I can hear the wheels rumblin' thru the floor.
And the sons of Pullman Porters, and the sons of engineers
Ride their father's magic carpet made of steel
And their days are full of restless, and their dreams are full of mem'ries
And the echos of the freight train whistle’s clear
Singin' good mornin' America, how are you?
Sayin' don't you know me?, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done.
And its twilight on the City of New Orleans.
Talk about your pocket full of friends
Half way home, and we'll be there by mornin'
With no tomorrow waiting ‘round the bend
Good night America, how are you?
Sayin' don't you know me?, I'm your native son
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done.

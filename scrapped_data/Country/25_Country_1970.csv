0,He Loves Me All The Way,Tammy Wynette,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tammy-wynette/he-loves-me-all-the-way-chords-1022202,"Sometimes when he comes home I'm cooking breakfast
I haven't slept a wink all night long  
I've been laying in bed thinking like a woman
Wondering if my man's been doing me wrong
To think he might be out with another woman
Makes my temper rise with jealousy
But all these years I've never caught him cheating
I guess he needs some time away from me
But when he loves me he really loves me
There's nothing left for me to say
Oh when he loves me he really loves me
He loved me all the way

 It's just like someone that you're needing to forget
 Honey that's the same thing with me
 I've been wondering baby why don't we
 Just make believe it ain't the first time we have met
 And before the night is over you're gonna be in love
 I bet you by the morning I'll be the only one
 That you'll be thinking of
 So we will will come together as close as fingers in a glove
 And before the night is over you gonna be in love
 Honey I can tell Jerry Lee can tell
 Somebody might put that lady there right through pure hell
 And she can use a little tenderness these things I know
 So if you feel that it's wrong
 I could be coming on a little bit too strong
 Just let me know I'll pack my junk I just might go
 And before the night is over you're gonna be in love
 I bet you by the morning I'll be the only one
 That you'll be thinking of
 So we will will come together as close as fingers in a glove

cause I wont be there to hold your hand,

You're a heck of a singer, and a powerful man,
but you surround yourself with people who demand
so little of you.
You touched my sould with your beautiful song,
you even had me singing along
right with you, You said I need You!
Then you changed the words and added harmony,
then you sang the song you had written for me,
to someone new.
Oh, and nobody sings a love song quite like you do,
Oh, and nobody else can make me sing along,
Nobody else can make me see
things are right when I know they're wrong
Nobody sings a love song quite like you.
Sing your song sweet music man,
travel the world with your six piece band,
that does for you, what you tell them to.
And you try to stay on wih this song you've sung,
to so many people who all demand to come back to you.
Sing youre song, sad music man,
making you live in the one night stands
that prove for you, they dont mean to.
You're still a heck of a singer but a broken man,
you keep on looking for one last band to sing to.
Oh and nobody sings a love song quite like you do,
and nobody else can make you sing along,
Nobody else can make me see,
things are right when they're wrong with this song,
nobody sings a love song quite like you.
Sing your song sweet music man, I believe in you.

And I thought that fate had it planned
Then someone stole my angel
And I lost what I loved most

I may never play a golden harp
Or spread celestial wings
Or walk a golden staircase
While a distant chorus sings.
But once I held your sweet love
And felt your tender touch
I may never get to heaven,
But I didn't miss it much.

Antiques would be modern, we would be the rage
Silk would be in fashion, we would dress in lace
Love would be the passion and the saving grace
I slept one rainy night with you in Paris
Made up for a thousand wasted years
Dearest Esmeralda, you are magic
I close my eyes and you make love appear
Dancing in the shimmer of a crystal chandelier
Shadows singin' so low only we could hear
Moving to the glimmer, shaking to the storm
Outside it was raging, but inside it was warm
We said goodnight in the candlelight and thunder
Now I wake and find you're never there
I'm becoming old enough to wonder
Happy that I'm still too young to care
Masterpieces crumble, empires tumble down
Refugees and fantasies go underground
Romance lasts forever, love don't fade away
They may take our future, but they can't stop yesterday
‘Cause somewhere in the cloudy skies of Paris
We were part of some artist his design
Dearest Esmeralda, you are magic
In the gray around me how you shine
Oh oh,   how you shine

I had the answers to all of my questions, love was so easy to see;
I didn't know.
When I was younger, I should have known better, I thought that nothing was new,
through all the spaces and all of the changes, what I lost sight of was you;
I didn't know,   I didn't know.
I could see you in singing skies and dancing waters
laughing children growing old,
and in the heart and in the spirit
and in the truth when it is told.
My life became shady and I grew afraid and I needed to find my way home,
I just couldn't see you, I thought that I'd lost you, I never felt so much alone;
are you still with me?
Somehow in reason, I lost sight of seasons, I'm growing out, growing in,
sometimes in evenings when daylight was needed I thought I'd never see you again;
are you still with me,   are you still with me
I 'm with you in singing skies and dancing waters
laughing children growing old,
and in the heart and in the spirit
and in the truth when it is told.
If my faith should falter and I should forsake you and find myself turning away,
will you still be there,   will you still be there?
I'll be there in singing skies and dancing waters,
laughing children growing old,
and in the heart and in the spirit
and in the truth when it is told.

48,Do You Know You Are My Sunshine,The Statler Brothers,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-statler-brothers/do-you-know-you-are-my-sunshine-chords-1448180,"She was standing in the crowd all alone and looking pretty
Listening to the music that we played
She walked up and whispered I leaned down and listened
To the request that she made
(Do you know)Do you know do you know You Are My Sunshine
She asked so sweet and tenderly
Do you know You Are My Sunshine
And would you do it one more time for me
Border to border and ocean to ocean
I still look for her every place
Chasing the sunshine each and every night
I’m searching every crowd for her face
She was gone just as quick as the song that she asked for
Taking my sunshine away
But someday when I finally look down and see her
I know just what I’m gonna say
(Do you know) do you know You Are My Sunshine
Do you know what your smile did to me
Do you know You Are My Sunshine
And it looks like you’re always gonna be
(Do you know) do you know You Are My Sunshine
Do you know what your smile did to me
Do you know You Are My Sunshine
And would you do it one more time for me
(Do you know) do you know You Are My Su-n-shine

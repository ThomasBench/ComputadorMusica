0,I Cant Hide This Anymore,Blue Rodeo,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/blue-rodeo/i-cant-hide-this-anymore-chords-1896722,"I can’t hide this anymore
I give up you win the war
All my memories are blurred 
But I remember what we were
And I can’t hide this anymore
Blue was the colour of your dress the night we met
Held your hand and walked you down the road
Full moon shining up above
Heard myself talking, but i was
Falling and falling and falling
And I can’t hide this anymore  (I cannot hide)
I give up you win the war (you win the war)
All the cruel things we said,
well, they’re stuck inside my head
And I can’t hide this anymore
Now and again I think back to better times
To tell you the truth, I thought that we were fine
Now I see you smiling with your friends
A smile I never see.  Oh, Honey, we're 
Stalling and stalling and stalling
And I can’t hide this anymore  (I cannot hide)
I give up you win the war (you win the war)
We both got better things to do
Than to sit around and see this through
And I can’t hide this anymore
Oh, the rain coming down
Falling like pearls from the sky
Oh, me I’m late coming ‘round
You must have thought I’m 
Such a fool running around so blind
No, I can’t hide this anymore  (I cannot hide)
I give up you win the war (you win the war)
All my memories are blurred
But I remember what we were
And I can’t hide this anymore
We’ve both got better things to do
Than sit around and see this through
But I can’t hide this anymore

Waiting on that sun to go down 
Won't you say I pick you up after work 
Slide over and slip out to the outskirts of town 
Got a blanket and a fifth of Comfort 
A little something to knock off the edge 
It's supposed to get a little cold tonight 
Looks like I'm gonna have to hold you tight 
Bout a mile off Old Mill Rd 
That spot nobody knows 
Park the truck and we take off running 
Hurry up girl I hear it coming 
Got a moon and a million stars 
The sound of steel and old box cars
The thought of you driving me insane
Come on baby let's go listen to the night train 
Yeah I hope it's gonna be a long one 
If we're lucky it's moving slow
Wouldn't mind if it lasted all night

2,Nothing But The Wheel,Patty Loveless,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/patty-loveless/nothing-but-the-wheel-chords-1406737," Way on past the boulevards 
Out here underneath the stars 
 I've been flying past the houses, farms and fields 
 Leaving all I know back there 
Rushing through the cold night air 
 And I'm holding on to nothin' but the wheel
 Staying clear of the interstate  
I'm seeking out those old two lanes 
 Trying to explain the way I feel 
Till all at once it's half past three 
And it's down... to just the trucks and me 
 And I'm holding on to nothin' but the wheel
 I've been trying to drive you off my mind 
Maybe that way baby I can leave it all behind
And forty-one goes on and on 
And the lights go winding in the dawn 
 And the sky's the color now of polished steel 
And the only thing I know for sure 
Is if you don't want me anymore 
 Then I'm holding on to nothin' but the wheel 
And the only thing I know for sure 
Is if you don't want me anymore 
 Then I'm holding on to nothin' but the wheel

When I first laid eyes on you
Well, the night just felt so odd
You looked at me and the stars lined up
So I thought I'd heard from God
Loving you was like throwing a lasso around a tornado
I tried to hold on to 
Took a ride on a tilt-a-whirl that sits on top of the world
Man, I thought I could show you
I've always been afraid of flying
But you can't blame a girl for trying
Felt like a pearl when I was holding your hand
So precious I forgot
You could have any girl but I only wanted one man
And you were everything I'm not
Still I gave it my best shot
Loving you was like throwing a lasso around a tornado
I tried to hold on to 
Took a turn on a high trapeze swinging over the deep
I thought I could show you
I've always been afraid of flying
But you can't blame a girl for trying
Like a vine bends a tree to the ground
I won't hold you down
I tried to climb just as high
But I found all the clouds touch the ground
In this small town
End Chorus:
Took a ride on a high trapeze swinging over the deep
I thought I could show you
That I've always been afraid of flying
But you can't blame a girl for trying
No, you can't blame a girl.... heeeey

I'm smilin' looking at this photograph
I hear that song and I'm flying right back

Every Friday night when the sun went down
We'd be runnin' them streets like we owned the town
And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do

After all this time it still feels so good

Singin' out the window, on the back roads,   Sweet Child of Mine
Sippin' on the local's spark of light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,
 all that wasted time
Out of nowhere, it slipped away
And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that I knew ain't nothing like it used to be
Ah, I can't explain
They took all the color from the picture frame
And the days got sold to the grid and the game
And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go

Singin' out the window, on the back roads,   Sweet Child of Mine
Sippin' on the local's spark of light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,
 all that wasted time
Summer dresses rained on the hood of the car
Only music that we had was out the left speaker
We were living every second 'til the time ran out
We had nothing but we had it all
When I think about those summer nights
Sneakin' out the window, runnin' back roads,   your hand in Mine
We were goin' nowhere we were so alive
Ain't it crazy how it's the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,
 all that wasted time
Swingin' out on the line

No ship out on the water will pay your rent
Cause you live and you learn, sometimes you get burned

It don't have to be like father, like son
Don't let them try to upsell you
There's a reason they make chocolate and vanilla, too
If there's any doubt, then there is no doubt, the gut don't never lie
And the only word you'll ever need to know in life is ""why""

I wish it was, him I mean.

Where you made your stand you were hand in hand
With the black-eyed angel of the evening star

Always dressed like a killer in the afternoon, sipping warm champagne from a silver spoon
In the night you would travel in your lover's car with your jewels so bright, like a shooting star
But your nightmares must have caught up with you and all the pills and the prophets couldn't get you through

Your hair was on fire, your shoes were misplaced on your face was a trace of a distant place
It's a long way home to Wichita where they put you back together fill your head with straw

It was an emptiness in her voice, hesitation when she smiled
She didn't have to say a word, it was just so plain to see
She had found what she'd been looking for and I knew it wasn't me
I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it
Sometimes I feel like a clown who can't wash off his make-up
All she wanted it was gone, Prince Charming I wasn't
But I would trade a thousand Babylons to be in her arms tomorrow
But like tide her love has come and gone and it's time for me to go
I saw goodbye in her eyes
I don't think I can change it
There's no way to disguise
We will never make it

Should I hold on to what we've got
Is is just a waste of time

I know you got somebody new now
All my candles have burned out

Cause nobody's home
When you live life for the lust
Sometimes you get cuts to the bone
But sometimes you get keys to the throne
Well the neon lights are on parade
Tomorrow swerves into yesterday

Just pills and pipes and alcohol

No name no face just a ghost alone

No dragons left to slay
Devils squeezed out all the hope

Reaches down  takes a hold

Some say love, it is a razor, that leads your soul to ble ed.
Some say love it is a hunger, and endless aching need.
I say love, it is a flower and you its only seed.
It's the heart afraid of breaking that never learns to dance.
It's the dream afraid of waking that never takes a chance.
It's the one who won't be taken who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying that never learns to live.
And the night has been too lonely and the road has been too long.
And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong.
Just re member in the winter for ben eath the bitter snow
Lies the seed that with the sun's love, in the spring becomes the rose.

	What i had called my brother,now he had every right to call on me
	Don't ever cuss that fiddle,boy unless you want that fiddle out of tune
	That picker there in trouble,boy ain't nothing but another side of you
	If we ever get to Heaven,boy it ain't because we ain't done nothing wrong
	We're in this thing together so let settle down and steal each other's songs
	I found a wounded brother drinking bitterly away the afternoon
	And soon enough he turned on me like he'd done every face in that saloon
	Well we cussed him to the ground and said he couldn't even steal a decent song
	But as soon as it was spoken we were sad enough to wish that we were wrong
	I know that it sounds silly but i think that i just somebody's song
	She's a good hearted woman in love with a good timin' man
	She loves him in spite of my ways that she don't understand

When love was sweet I meant the world to you
Now comes the sun we'll say goodbye forever
And teardrops will kiss the morning dew
Take me and make me your lover one more time
Close in your arms as before
Till on your shoulder the early morning shines
Then I'll leave you and breath you no more
When time was young we walked the road together
When love was sweet I meant the world to you
Now comes the sun we'll say goodbye forever
And teardrops will kiss the morning dew
Daisies need sunshine and roses need rain
So it was all meant to be
The wild bird needs wings free to take to the wind
And so it was meant for you and me

When love was sweet I meant the world to you

 When God dips His love in my heart
 When God dips His pen of love in my heart
 And He writes my soul a message He wants me to know
 His spirit all divine fills this sinful soul of mine
 When God dips His love in my heart
 Well I said I wouldn't tell it to a living soul
 How He brought salvation and He made me whole
 But I found I couldn't hide such love as Jesus did impart
 Well He made me laugh and He made me cry set my sinful soul on fire
 When God dips His love in my heart, in my heart
 Sometimes though the way is dreary dark and cold
 And some unburdened sorrow keeps me from the goal
 I go to God in prayer I can always find Him there
 To whisper sweet peace to my soul
 Well I said I wouldn't tell it to a living soul
 How He brought salvation and He made me whole
 But I found I couldn't hide such love as Jesus did impart
 Well He made me laugh and He made me cry set my sinful soul on fire
 When God dips His love in my heart,
 He walked every step up Calvary's rugged way
 And He gave His life completely to bring a better day
 My life was steeped in sin but in love He took me in
 His blood washed away every stain
 Well I said I wouldn't tell it to a living soul
 How He brought salvation and He made me whole
 But I found I couldn't hide such love as Jesus did impart
 Well He made me laugh and He made me cry set my sinful soul on fire
 When God dips His love in my heart,
 When God dips His love, His sweet love, in my heart,

Looking for the perfect phrase
The one I finally choose is simply I love you
As the words come out I heard a voice inside me say
What made you say that
Was it the moonlight, was it the starlight in your eyes
What made you say that
Have you been listening to your heart
It's too late now, you don't want to take it back
Cause I know love's what made you say that
I look up to see his reaction
And a smile slowly spreads across his face
He said what took you so long
That's what I've been waiting on
I thought you'd take forever and a day

She never played with dolls or lacy kinds of things
Jenny counted boxcars instead of counting sheep
She could go anywhere when she went to sleep
All she ever talked about was gettin' on to ride
She was livin' in another time you could see it in her eyes
Everyday after school she'd head down to the tracks
Waitin' for the train that was never comin' back
Jenny dreamed of trains
When the nighttime came
Nobody knew how she made it come true
Jenny dreamed of trains
The depot's been boarded up, the rails have turned to rust
There hasn't been a train through her since the mill went bust
No one believed her when she said she heard the train
Said she was just a little girl actin' kinda strange
Jenny dreamed of trains
When the nighttime came
Nobody knew how she made it come true
Jenny dreamed of trains
Jenny laid a penny on the tracks one day
in God we trust she walked away
The very next mornin' all that she could find
was a little piece of copper squashed flatter than a dime
Jenny dreamed of trains
When the nighttime came
Nobody knew how she made it come true
Jenny dreamed of trains
Nobody knew how she made it come true

And fortune falls like snow flakes in your hands
Now I don't recall who said it
But we'd lived so long on credit
And so we headed out to find our promised land
Just poor Smoky Mountains farm folk
With nothing more than high hopes
So we hitched our station wagon to a star
But our dreams are failing on us
Cause there was no land of promise
Though it's a struggle just keepin' sight of who you are
Oh and these northern nights are dreary
And my southern heart is weary
As I wonder how the old folks are back home

And they're all thinking of me

About what's been and what awaits me
It takes all I've got to give what life demands
You go insane if you give in to it
Life's a mill and I've been through it
I'm just thankful I'm creative with my hands
Oh and these northern nights they're dreary
And my southern eyes are teary
As I wonder how the old folks are back home
But I'll keep leanin' on my Jesus
He'll love and guide and lead us
   Smoky Mountains memories keep me strong
If I'll keep looking to the father
Keep our heads above the water
While the Smoky Mountains memories keep me strong

        .....Hey hey hey.......Hey hey hey                            I 
......need no money, fortune, or fame
I've got all the riches baby, one man can claim
Well I   guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way
My girl (my girl my girl)  talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl.......Talkin' 'bout my girl
On a cloudy day with my girl   I've even got the month of May
My girl......talkin' 'bout  talkin' 'bout my girl                Talkin' 
                        Talkin' 'bout my girl               (Fade)

There's only you in my life
The only thing that's right
My first love
You're every breath that I take
You're every step I make
And I
I want to share
All my love with you
  No one else will do
And your eyes
They tell me how much you care
Oh yes,  you will always be
My endless love
Two hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives have just begun
Forever
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms
Oh, love
I'll be the fool for you
I'm sure
And you know I don't mind
'Cause you
You mean the world to me
I know I found in you
My endless love
Oh, love
I'll be the fool for you
I'm sure
And you know I don't mind
And yes
You'll be the only one
'Cause no one can deny
This love I have inside
And I'll give it all to you
My love,
My endless love

I keep on praying for a blue sky, I keep on searching through the rain.
I keep on thinking of the good times, will they ever come again?

Where danger silently creeps
And storms so violently sweep
You're driftin' too far from the shore
You're drifting too far from the shore
You're drifting too far from the shore
Come to Jesus today, let Him show you the way
You're drifting too far from the shore
Today, the tempest rose high
And clouds overshadöwed the sky
Sure depth is hovering nigh
And you're drifting too far from the shore
You're drifting too far from the shore
You're drifting too far from the shore
Come to Jesus today, let Him show you the way
You're drifting too far from the shore

That's a blowin' in from the west
I've been drivin' all day
Lord, I sure could use some rest
And there's a motel up ahead where I can unwind
'Cause I sure love thunderstorms and neon signs
I grew up on the road from town to town
My daddy's line of work kept us movin' around
I got fond memories of the way things were back then
The warmth of a neon when a cold storm is movin' in
Listen to the opry in a small cafe
When we stop to get a bite along the way
Whenever I hear the wheels begin to whine
It takes me back to another time
I got a real nice room with a radio and TV
This here motel livin' is the only life for me
And it looks like it'll be rainin' for quite some time
Mixed with the lightning is the glow from a neon sign
Listen to the opry in a small cafe
When we stop to get a bite along the way
Whenever I hear the wheels begin to whine
It takes me back to another time
Well, there's some big black clouds
That's a blowin' in from the west
I've been drivin' all day
Lord, I sure could use some rest
And there's a motel up ahead where I can unwind
'Cause I sure love thunderstorms and neon signs

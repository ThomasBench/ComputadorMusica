Takes forever gettin' ready, so she's never on time for anything...
When she gets that come get me look in her eyes
Well, it kinda scares me, the way that she drives me wild, and she drives me wild...
Beautiful.. Crazy..
She can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve...
Yeah, she's crazy, but her crazy is beautiful to me.......
She makes plans for the weekend, can't wait to go out
Till she changes her mind, says let's stay on the couch, and watch TV
And she falls asleep....
Beautiful.. Crazy..
She can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve...
Yeah, she's crazy, but her crazy is beautiful to me.......
She's unpredictable, unforgettable, it's unusual, unbelievable
How I'm such a fool, yeah I'm such a fool... for her.....
Beautiful.. Crazy..
She can't help but amaze me
The way that she dances, ain't afraid to take chances
And wears her heart on her sleeve...
Yeah, she's crazy, she's crazy, she's crazy,
But her crazy is beautiful to me.......
Her crazy is beautiful to me.......

I said ""Somewhere you never been to""
Little town outside of Knoxville
Hidden by some dogwood trees
She tried talkin' with my accent
We held hands and waded into
That blue water
She left her flip-flops by my Red Wings on the beach
Yeah but, now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed mе tells me she'd lovе Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots
I said ""Let's go shoot tequila""
So we walked back to that beach bar
She said ""Don't cowboys drink whiskey?""
So we drank bottom shelf
She said ""Damn, that sky looks perfect""
I said ""Girl, you've never seen stars like the ones back home""
And she said ""Maybe I should, see 'em for myself""
Yeah, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots
I said meet me in the mornin'
And she told me I was crazy
Yeah, but I still thought that maybe she'd show up
Oh, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado

To a better place than the one we're at
And i ain't got no kinda plan
I've had all of this town I can stand
I got friends out on the coast
We can jump in the water and see what floats
We've been saving for a rainy day
Let's beat the storm and be on our way
It don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
I can be your lucky penny, you can be my four-leaf clover
Starting over
This might not be an easy time
There's rivers to cross and hills to climb
Some days we might fall apart
And some nights might feel cold and dark
Nobody wins afraid of losing
And the hard roads are the ones worth choosing
Some days we'll look back and smile
And know it was worth every mile
It don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life

3,Forever After All,Luke Combs,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/luke-combs/forever-after-all-chords-3388115,"A cold beer's got 12 ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
  Duracells in a Maglite
  A needle drop on a 45
Are the kinda things that only last so long
When the new wears off, and they get to getting old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a t-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all
FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fading out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off and they get to getting old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a t-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes

The good lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows that, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all

With tips in a jar, my guitar, and an old barstool

Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now

At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town

Who was burnin' CDs just to give away
Payin' his dues if I wasn't doin' this

Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true
Livin' this life just like I was born to do

Maybe a baby or a couple by now
Long driveway to a big white house

  Find yourself thinking about

Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?

And sippin' on a sixer with me

Of a good old boy like me

And every song I ever sang
On a guitar out of tune

Things I can’t forget
The way you turned and smiled on me
On the night that we first met
And I remember every night
Your ocean eyes of blue
How I miss you in the morning light
Like roses miss the dew
I’ve been down this road before
Alone as I can be
Careful not to let my past
Go sneaking up on me
Got no future in my happiness
Though regrets are very few
Sometimes a little tenderness
Was the best that I could do
I remember everything
Things I can’t forget
Swimming pools of butterflies
That slipped right through the net
And I remember every night

Now close your eyes and spin around
Say, hard  times, you could find
But it ain't the way that you  want
But it's still alright
Late at night, you lay around wondering?
Counting all the lines, it ain't so funny now
Say, times are hard, you get this far
But it ain't the way that you want
I'll be damned if this old man
Don't start to counting his losses
But it's still alright
 They say you learn a lot out there
 How to scorch and burn
 Gonna have to bury your friends
 And then you'll find it gets worse
 Standing out on the ledge
 With no way to get down
You start praying for wings to grow
Oh, baby, just let go
I ain't alright, spinning out ahead
It was cold outside when I hit the ground
Say, I could sleep here, forget all the fear
But, it would take time to grow
Maybe, I don't know
Hey, tonight, if you think about it
Remembering all the times that you pointed out
Say, the glass is clear, now with all this fear
Starts a-leaving a mark
Your idle hands are all that stands uh
From your time in the dark

And I'll drive through Colorado
on a rocky stretch of road
with no one who loves me
as far as telephone poles go
I wish I was a trustin' man
but a trustin' man is weak
The only thing worth trustin' is
some brass through crooked teeth
some brass through crooked teeth
some brass through crooked teeth
Your crooked teeth are floatin' and my lady's restin' fine
Seven miles out of Bismarck next to Bakken Oil lines
I laid her down so softly and so kindly reassured
Love it ain't for tamin', a disease that can't be cured
Lost my bride to the finest man
she claims to have ever known
She got to the parking lot
his knees were already blown
Love is such a mighty drug
a mightier disease
Bet he misses her floatin' past the barge
with one eye and crooked teeth

My fair lady
 She walked the high wire back in the 80’s
 Feathers and sequins
She shined like a chandelier
Hanging from the top tent rafters
Till the spotlight disappeared
Harlan Giovanni
What a sight to see
The way he earned her trust was on a 20-foot trapeze
 She fell so hard because he always let her fly
Till he left her heart suspended
In a cotton candy sky
 She still don’t know why
Every show must еnd
Every circus leaves town
You don’t know thе magic’s gone
Until the lights go down
Now she’s back in Nacogdoches
And I hear she’s doing well
She only misses Harlan when she hears a carousel
 Pretty Elaina
Made herself a nest
Her sequins and her secrets
Buried in her cedar chest
 No one around here knows about her other life
Johnny Davis went and made her a mama and a wife
 And maybe that’s alright
‘Cause every show must end
Every circus leaves town
You don’t know thе magic’s gone
Until the lights go down
Now she’s back in Nacogdoches
And I hear she’s doing well
She only misses Harlan when she hears a carousel
 Smith County Fair
Mid-September
 She walks the midway
And smiles when she remembers
Every show must end
Every circus leaves town
I didn’t know the magic left
Till all the lights went down
Now I’m back in Nacogdoches
And I swear I’m doing well
I only miss my Harlan when I hear a carousel

And the hard roads are the ones worth choosing

 Am I the only one to quit singing along every time they play to a Bruce Springsteen song
Am I the only one still sitting here holding on holding back my tears for ones who paid with the lives they
gave, god bless the USA
I’m not the only one still willing to fight for my love red and white
And the blue burning on the ground as the statues come down in a town near you
Watching the threads of old glory come undone
Am I the only one                             Can't be the only the one
I am not the only one

You're so devious, rode in
From the Windy City
I ain't got a clear view
Tell me what you want me to do and
You tell me every single secret in your mind
Come on baby, we got nothing but time
You say I'm too young for you
You're scared I'm too right for you
You said you hate the smell of cigarette smoke
You only used to smoke when you drank
When you lived in Chicago
Unsure where the wind blows
I wish I'd known you in your wilder days
And now here we go
You got me falling in love again
You gotta secret, I wanna keep it
I wish I'd known you in your wilder days
The way you move your hands across my body
I'm kissing you in a hotel lobby
Baby, I don't wanna lose this feeling
You're giving me something to believe in
And who were you before I knew your name?
Were you drunk at midnight waiting for the train?
You could have been anyone back then
Just another kid reaching for the wind
You said you hate the smell of cigarette smoke
You only used to smoke when you drank
When you lived in Chicago
Unsure where the wind blows
I wish I'd known you in your wilder days
And now here we go
You got me falling in love again
You gotta secret, I wanna keep it
I wish I'd known you in your wilder days
What were you like when you were a little wilder?
Why don't you show me?
Why don't you show me?
What you were like when you got a little higher?
Just for tonight, just for tonight
You said you hate the smell of cigarette smoke
You only used to smoke when you drank
When you lived in Chicago
Unsure where the wind blows
I wish I'd known you in your wilder days
And now here we go
You got me falling in love again
You gotta secret, I wanna keep it
I wish I'd known you in your wilder days
I wish I'd known you in your wilder days
I wish I'd known you in your wilder days

He's a pretty nice fellow but he's kind of confused.
He's got muscles in his head that ain't never been used.
Thinks he own half of this town.
Starts drinking heavy, gets a big red nose.
Beats his old lady with a rubber hose,
then he takes her out to dinner and buys her new clothes.
That's the way that the world goes 'round.
That's the way that the world goes 'round.
You're up one day and the next you're down.
It's half an inch of water and you think you're gonna drown.
That's the way that the world goes 'round.
I was sitting in the bathtub counting my toes,
when the radiator broke, water all froze.
I got stuck in the ice without my clothes,
naked as the eyes of a clown.
I was crying ice cubes hoping I'd croak,
when the sun come through the window, the ice all broke.
I stood up and laughed thought it was a joke
That's the way that the world goes 'round.
That's the way that the world goes 'round.

He's a bible by the bed
He's the t-shirt that I'm wearing

He's solid and he's steady
Like the Allegheny runs
He knows just where he's going
And he's proud of where he's from
One of the good ones
He's one of the good ones
A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones
You'll know him when you see him
By the way he looks at me
You'd say he hung the moon
I'd say he hung the galaxy
Nobody does it better
Oh the way he pulls me in
I've known a couple bad ones
But they all led me to him
He's one of the good ones
A love me like he should one

The kind you find when you don't even look one

And I guess pawn shop diamond rings

And I guess a black dress at a funeral
Means that life has one stage
And I guess a girl like you lovin’ me must mean
Angels love anything
Cause I’m a messed-up kid
With nothing to spare
Turn a saint into a heathen
With my hands going through your hair
I'm a messed up kid
Nothing to show
Except a girl saying she’ll be here
Everywhere I go
I’m a messed-up kid
Well my old man says I’m wild
And my momma says I’m reckless
And that color in your eyes
reminds me of East Texas

Messed up kid
Nothing to show
Except a girl saying she’ll be here

All this bullshit that I’ve been through
And all the hardship’s I’ve grown akin to
They take me around and leave me feeling down
but you pick me up every time

At a bar on the beach in the sun somewhere
 Knowing you, you got something cold in your hand
 Chatting up a stranger without a care
 Knowing you, you're still wild and free
And knowing you, you're probably way over me
 But God we were so a________live
I was a kid on a carnival ride
Holdin' my breath 'til the moment
When you were gonna leave me too soon
But I'd do it all over
'Cause damn it was good knowing you
 Knowing you was a free-fall from a hundred thousand feet
 When you don't even care where you land
 And knowing you was the kind of rush that you feel
When you finally get to sit in with the band
 And knowing you, you're still a tumbleweed

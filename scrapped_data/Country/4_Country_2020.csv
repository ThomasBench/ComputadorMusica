0,Circles Around This Town,Maren Morris,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/maren-morris/circles-around-this-town-chords-4018636,"I swear I don't know how I trusted
A Montero with the AC busted
A couple bad demos on a burned CD
Would take me all the way to Tennessee
I showed up to the new apartment
First month's, last month's, two deposits
Hadn't heard the sound of a door slam yet
Thank God I was an optimist
I drove circles around this town
Tryna ride circles around this town
Tryna say something with meanin'
Somethin' worth singin' about
I've been kind and I've been ruthless
Yeah, I got here but the truth is
Thought when I'd hit it, it'd all look different
But I still got the pedal down
Drivin' circles around this tow-ow-own
So many times I thought about leaving
Got my ass kicked tryin' to compete with
Everybody else is ones that got away
Hung around long enough to catch a break
Couple hundred songs and the ones that finally worked
Was the one about a car and the one about a church
Drivin' circles around this town
Tryna ride circles around this town
Tryna say something with meanin'
Somethin' worth singin' about
I've been kind and I've been ruthless
Yeah, I got here but the truth is
Thought when I'd hit it, it'd all look different
But I still got the pedal down
Drivin' circles around this tow-ow-own
Drivin' circles around this tow-ow-own

Thought when I'd hit it, it'd all look different

Oh, I'm outta time
Headed down the PCH to that Malibu line
Baby, I'm outta time
I met a man in Denver
Bottle neck and some old blue jeans
Tells me we got something special
Now I say ""Some things ain't what they seem""
Run off with the sunrise
Reno never felt so slow
A Wednesday child with a rented ride
And a head that's full of woe
And I'm outta time
Oh, I'm outta time
Headed down the PCH to that Malibu line
Baby, I'm outta time
Drag me to the party, guess I got nowhere to go
Got a man to my left and one on my right
And they're telling me 'bout what they know
Headed for the back, I meet a girl who's tryna shoot the breeze
She tells me she don't like Elvis
I say ""I want a little less conversation, please""

  What if I'm scared to go back? What if nothing's the same?
Well, it just might be the hardest thing I'll do
Yeah, well, I can't seem to shake these young man's blues
  Still see them double gates swingin' out wide
  Nowadays that iron fence don't seem so high
  Wonder if that rodeo man still lives across the street
  Don't wanna say ""Goodbye"", but it's time I guess
  Next time I drive by, hope it hurts a little less
  Growin' up ain't all it's cracked up to be

A green rectangle around the door
Please be careful
What you wish for
I whisper to myself
Then I’m spinning it half around

A far away sound
Saying be good to me
Be good to me
Marigold in the garden
My heart is out in the garbage
I am being
An alarmist
Cause for as far as I see
It’s terrible territory
And there’s no one
To reassure me
So it would be good to talk
For my sanity
Now do what you feel like you gotta do
But be good to me
When you walk away
You still exist and I feel good knowing it
If it hurts me
Why'd I rely so much on it in the first place?
If it's happening
Then why's this feeling taking over me?
Could I believe
In the me before I knew you beautifully? (x4)

Nothing's gonna come and fix it, all I've fell for, it's all my fault
Nothing's gonna change
Nothing's gonna come and break your fall
'Cause life is gonna break your balls
Well, it's a new day, one more chance to step in the light
Sun is out, feel what it's all about
Well, they come and go, highs and lows that lead to the dark and light of my mind
But they're so sincere, triumph and fear, coursing, forcing their might
Well, you can't live this life straight, so get high, get gone
Well, I think it's a little too late to be moving on
No one is a really to say, what's right, what's wrong
So let's just get through the day
Maybe a new way, to get more fists for the fight
Fight or flight, I recheck the meter but the meter was right
When the dance is done, still nobody wanna live in no paradise
At least you took the time to take the transcendental ticket to ride
Well, I can't live this life straight, I get high, I get gone
Well, I think it's a little too late to be moving on
Who's really able to say, what's right and what's wrong
So, let's just get through the day
So, let's just get through the day
Let's just get through the day
So, let's just get through the day
Let's just get through the dayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

The 7-Up would balance out the beer
Mom would make us dinner, and we'd all try not to choke
Dad was working later every year
We count the trucks on Highway 1 on their way to Jacksonville
Wonderin’ where they headed on from there
My brothers and my sister all stood spiritually still
As if those roads became the answers to their prayers
   But I didn't want it any other way
This town was the one thing that felt right
   All these tourists could be kings during the day
  But not in St. Augustine at night
I was working at the bait shack, supplying all the fishing tours
Pretty soon I was chartering a boat
My dad said I needed dumb luck and a secret stash of Coors
If I stood a chance at keeping things afloat
That's when my girlfriend told me “There’s a baby on the way
And I need to know you're gonna go to bat.”
Well, I never put off 'til tomorrow the things I shoulda done today
No, I've always waited way longer than that
  I have never had much say in how I felt
I've been guided by my barroom appetites
   So if this world belongs to everybody else
Just leave me St. Augustine at night
  The Lord must really love us common folk
'cause he made so goddamn much
  Now, if he'd just point the way to go
  If he'd could just start speaking up
  Our oldest brother left this world for leading one too many lives
I guess he settled for none at all
The rest of us just grew apart and blamed our husbands and our wives
When anyone was asked why they don’t call
Life became a series of birthdays, cars, and pets
Just anything to look forward to
I don’t talk about mistakes. I don't talk about regrets
At this point, I’m not sure what good it would do
  And I'm not asking for anybody's help
As I gaze out where the stars dance with the lights
  If I'm not sure how I feel about myself
I still got St. Augustine at night

Or tell them that I need her
And that without her I would die
I'm not gonna argue
They won't listen to me
I'm just gonna stay right here
Under the poplar tree
Let me tell you a story
It happened this way
It was born out of longing
In a man that's gone astray
I've been to the valley
In the shadow of death
I've crossed many rivers
Wearing a scar on my chest
Can't outrun this heartache?
A man, he sure can try
I gave my all to that woman
Then she turned around and said goodbye
I was in a high desert
Dell City was the town
That's when my luck turned south
This ol' boy started showin' out
He killed the clerk and a young girl
Who was only standin' there
He looked at me real peculiar
With the bullets flying through the air
I lit out in a hurry
He went out in a hearse
Heartbroken and wanted
Couldn't tell you which one of 'em is worse
He must've been real important
Cause his posse caught up to me
I was holding my head up
When they hung me from a poplar tree
Yes, they hung me from a poplar tree

I doubt anyone will remember
After I'm gone
The places I've been
There's some I'd go back to
And some where I won't go again
And most of the time
I'm feelin' like I'm fadin' into the night
But when I'm with you
I feel like a dreamer
That's had all his dreams come true
Like my skies are all blue
When I'm with you
I got a good job
And I'm thankful to be workin'
When so many good peoplе are not
Sometimes I can't stand
How my back and my hands
Thеy won't work like they used to
Somewhere in my mind
I'm still searchin' for something
I know that I'm not gonna find
When I know for sure
I've got so much more
Than a man ever needs

isn't just a reminder
Of how we keep letting each other down

Riding bikes out on the street
Playing tag in the backyard
You'll outgrow your shoes
You'll outgrow your bed
You'll outgrow this house

You're still gonna be my baby
Even when you're my age

You'll still be full of questions
That I wish I had the answers to right now
And those dark times 
might make you second guess it
I bet love will still be making the world go round
When I was your age
I didn't worry like I think you do
Back then, innocence was something
You could hold on to
You'll outgrow your shoes
You'll outgrow your bed
You'll outgrow this house
Just don't forget
When you're all grown up
But you don't feel that way
You're still gonna be my baby
Even when you're my age
When you have kids someday
I hope you teach them the Lord's Prayer
Before they go to bed at night
Like my Daddy did for me
And his Mother before him
Well something about it just keeps you right
And I hope you don't work too much overtime
So you can be right there beside them
When they close their little eyes
Cause they'll outgrow their shoes
They'll outgrow their beds
They'll outgrow that house
And you can't stop it
Life will line your face
Time will turn the page
But they're still gonna be your babies

wearing more than he drank of his drink

Desparate to find a last minute queen
While the rest of us are all headed home
To try finding comfort in dreams
Cause this isn't life
And I know that I chose it
But I can't stand waking up
And nobody knows it
I'll never find the strength
to change what I need
Is this who I’ll always be?
I open my eyes and the room is still spinning
Thе funniest part of this feeling is knowing the answer
but nothing comеs out
So I'm shaking around like I'm hanging from something
I know is about to break
Like I'm biting the gun but the safety is on
I threw up the pills I ate
The notes are all scribbled in pencil
Without really knowing what I'm trying to write
Something like 'goddamn the man who said everything's gonna be fine'
We get out of it what we put in
That's when doubt kicks in
Maybe I just don't have it inside me
Maybe there's too much I couldn't face
I just wanted someone to come down from heaven
and explain this cold and fucked up place
But I'll just keep trying to hide it
until there's nothing left to save

Knew then and there she was the one
She gave him a love every man knows is needed
She gave him a daughter, she gave him a son
One day, while Juanita was out in the garden
A bandit rode up without makin' a sound
Dood was workin' the plow, far away from his rifle
Tried to get to it but the bandit drew down
Last thing he remembered was Juanita's screamin'
As the world faded black and Dood crumpled down
When hе came to the bandit was nowherе to be seen
His true love Juanita nowhere to be found
A man and his rifle, a mule and his hound
One in the saddle, one on the ground
Saw the ball had passed through clean as a church floor
And the wound was washed up by Sams, old hound
So he saddled up Shamrock and powdered his rifle
Put on his old hat, worn, weathered and brown
Told his son to stay strong, take care of his sister
'Til Daddy returned Mama safe and sound
Then they set out together to go find Juanita
Old Dood in the saddle, and Sam on the ground
Vowin' never to stop 'til Juanita was found

Like you're first in line for losing
I thought my life was cruising then it crumbled all away
I had a lot to give but what I gave should be forgotten
Unnoticed like a stranger I'll surrender for the day
Well this night was an illusion,
It came down like an intrusion
I stay up through the night though
I can't stand it sinking low
I'm a witness to the fight between
The darkness and the light
You're a mean old world I'm leaving though
I have no place to go
You're a mean old world I'm leaving though
I have no place to go
This old world took me for a ride
I lost everything I had and then my pride
So much that I don't know, but I guess I'm set to go
And this old world she took me for a ride
I was raised when I saw ugliness
To try to make some beauty
Found purpose in the duty when
I couldn't find the shore
What beauty couldn't lift just simply floated on adrift
Rolling on directionless and lost forevermore
It goes from bad to worse sometimes
Before it can get better
I string some words together and
Just try to speak the truth
I have a lot to get, I hope my lot will be forgiven
Pardon me for living for the time I'm here with you
Pardon me for living for the time I'm here with you
This old world took me for a ride
I lost everything I had and then my pride
So much that I don't know, but I guess I'm set to go
And this old world she took me for a ride
When I lay my body down I'd like to
Feel the dirt beneath me
And the howling wind could sheath me and
I'd finally be set free
For a moment you can yawn and
Throw my things into a pile
My dawn is finally here and
Yours might come in just a while
My dawn is finally here and
Yours might come in just a while
This old world took me for a ride
I lost everything I had and then my pride
So much that I don't know, but I guess I'm set to go

And the local time was 11:11
The pilot had his eyes closed
Through that opalescent open road
And then time spread and expanded
The lines fanned out across the land
And I let it
Land me down and tether me ’till I get it
Can I leave the canopy forever
And land me down eternally

46,Again,Aaron Lewis,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/aaron-lewis/again-chords-4053418,"I try when I look back, but I still just feel numb
And I see in my shadow the man I've become
All the times that I've gone down the wrong roads in life
The wrong turns I've taken the only ones I get right
I ain't one for foldin' the hand I've been dealt
All the games I've been playin', well, I forgot how it felt
To have the wind in my back and the sun on my face
The storm clouds behind me and I'm still in the race
I got my windows rolled down and the rain pourin' in
Forgot what it's like to feel good in my skin
'Cause I'd give everything to feel anything
Again
All the years chasin' sad songs, it sure takes a toll
On the ones you leave waitin', when are you comin' home?
I'm faded and jaded and frayed at both ends
And just lookin' to get high with some help from my friends
With the wind in my back and the sun on my face
The storm clouds behind me and I'm still in the race
I got my windows rolled down and the rain pourin' in
Forgot what it's like to feel good in my skin
I'd give everything to feel anything
Again
Mm-mm
With the wind in my back and the sun on my face
The good Lord above me tryin' to show me the way
I got my windows rolled down and the sun's pourin' in
Forgot what it's like to feel good in my skin
'Cause I'd give everything to feel anything
I'd give everything to feel anything
Again
Well, I'd give everything
To feel anything

47,Ill Love You Till The Day I Die,Willie Nelson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/willie-nelson/ill-love-you-till-the-day-i-die-chords-4068301,"I only saw you once
And that was a long, long time ago
You probably don't remember me
But I thought I'd let you know
That one short conversation
 Is still the reason why
I'll love you,
 Till the day I die
You knew I was an honest man
 I guess I knew it too
But if I'd known then what I know now
I'd trade it all for you
And when you turned and walked away
 I didn't bat an eye
But I'll love you,
Till the day I die
 I didn't know my heart back then
 What was there to know
 If I could do it all again
I'd never let you go
Twenty minutes, twenty years ago
Is still the reason why
I'll love you,
 Till the day I die
In case I still might sleep with you
In some sweet by and by
I'm gonna love you,
 Till the day I die
I'm gonna love you,
Till the day I die

48,Stars Like Confetti,Dustin Lynch,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/dustin-lynch/stars-like-confetti-chords-4069510,"There we were
In the back of that old Z-71
The road was dirt
A couple kids waitin' on the sun
Cherry red
Baby, I still recall the taste
We were a few beers shy of freedom
I had my hands around your waist
You said, ""Babe, I'm gettin' cold""
I said, ""Climb on in my jacket""
You already know
Like my heart, you can have it
Oh, I don't remember what the radio was playin'
I was hangin' like the moon on all the words your lips were sayin'
  All I know is there was magic in that Chevy baby
You were glowin', God was throwin'
Stars like confetti, ah ah
Stars like confеtti, ah ah
Yeah, rusted truck, dusted-up boots
And high on a pеrfume buzz
That see-forever sky wasn't near as high as us
Yeah, our hearts were beatin' faster
Than a runaway midnight train
We couldn't say forever
But we said it anyway
Baby, hold me tight and never let me go
Look up at the sky, Heaven's puttin' on a show
I don't remember what the radio was playin'
I was hangin' like the moon on all the words your lips were sayin'
  All I know is there was magic in that Chevy baby
You were glowin', God was throwin'
Stars like confetti, ah ah
We made a wish on everyone, ah ah
We held on 'til it was done, woah oh
I don't remember what the radio was playin'
I was hangin' like the moon on all the words you're sayin'
  All I know is there was magic in that Chevy baby

49,From Austin (ver 2),Zach Bryan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/zach-bryan/from-austin-chords-4099804,"There is concrete below me and a sky above so blue
I'm finally leaving Austin and I wish it was with you
I am just a sickness and you seem to be the cure
How much can a southern girl honestly endure?
Remember northwest mountains, they were snow-capped in June
You were napping on my arms on a Sunday afternoon
But, babe, I've gotta heal myself from the things I've never felt
Repression is my heaven but I'd rather go through hell
It's 'bout time that I left Austin
'Bout time you settled down
With a man who doesn't move as quick
As the train rolling through town
'Bout time that I face
The hard times I've let go
If love was just an ocean
I would drown before I float
You remember getting drunk on the outskirts of this town
When I gave you all I had, but it still let you down?
Everyone I've ever loved has either left or died
Wish I was born with concrete shoes, but I'm leaving tonight
It's 'bout time that I left Austin
'Bout time you settled down
With a man who doesn't move as quick
As the trains rolling through town
'Bout time that I face
The hard times I've let go
If love was just an ocean
I would drown before I float
Float
Float
There's concrete below me and a sky above so blue
People ruin people, I don't wanna ruin you
I am just a sickness and you seem to be the cure
How much can a southern girl honestly endure?
And I'm finally gone from Austin
You finally settled down
With a man who didn't move as quick
As the trains that rolled through town
I finally had to face
The hard times I've let go
If loving you was an ocean
I'd have drowned so you could float

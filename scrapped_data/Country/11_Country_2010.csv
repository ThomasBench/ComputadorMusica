0,Yours Wedding Edition,Russell Dickerson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/russell-dickerson/yours-wedding-edition-chords-2648985,"I came alive when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heart beat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got the chance to touch the sea
Just forgot on the shelf
No wind in the sails
Going no where with no one but me
I was one in one-hundred billion
A burned out star in a galaxy
Just lost in the sky wondering why
everyone else shines out but me
I came alive when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
I was a worn out set of shoes
Wondering the city street
Another face in the crowd
Head looking down
Lost in the sound of a lonely melody
Empty pockets at a roulette
Always landing on a lost bet
Just live for the spin and hope for the win
Go all in just to lose again
I came alive when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heart beat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
I was a boat stuck in a bottle
That never got a chance to touch the sea
I came alive when I first kissed you
The best me has his arms around you
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours
The worst me is just a long gone memory
You put a new heart beat inside of me
You make me better than I was before
Thank God I'm yours

1,Methhead,Ian Noe,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ian-noe/methhead-chords-2254275,"I saw him down in a dump, hurling armloads of junk
into a pickup, bound for the yard.
He was skiddish and strange, like a wild dog with mange
and there was blood, where his veins ran hard.
Wadin' deep through the grime, he found a long copper line
then he jumped up, and leaped to the ground.
You'd have thought he'd struck gold, the way he kicked and he rolled
and like a bandit, he tore out of town.
Oh now, he's out on the prowl
you better get up, and go back inside.
Because he's loose on the land, getting all that he can
and there won't be, nowhere to hide.
Yea he's crawling his way, to his fix for the day
you won't stop him, he's bent to be fed.
He's the low heathen kind, with a shit mangled mind
the desperate, fucking methhead.
There was a girl tall and thin, with scabbed yellow skin
inside a rest stop, I won't soon forget.
She was digging at a rash, trying to deal up some cash
saying baby, i'm clean and i'm wet.
I just kept pacing by, swatting through the flies
her stench, rancid and stout.
While she stood there crying please, with her fists between her knees
and the sores, draining arond her mouth.
Oh now, she's out on the prowl
you better get up, and go back inside.
Because she's loose on the land, getting all that she can
and there won't be, nowhere to hide.
Yea she'll bum and she'll beg, she'll knaw at your leg
you can't kill her, she's already dead.
She's the empty eyed soul, the zombie like foal
the feanding, fucking methhead.
It's getting dark pretty soon, they love to lurk by the moon
so i'm out back, shoveling the dirt.
I'm gonna dig me a whole, as far as I can go
and when they fall, i'll cover them up.
Oh now, they're out on the prowl
you better get up, and go back inside.
Because they're sweeping the land, getting all that they can
and there won't be, nowhere to hide.
They've got the taste on their tounge, their fates have been hung
it's a fever, that's already spread.
From out far and wide, they're the fit to be tied
the worthless, fucking methhead.

2,To Live A Life,First Aid Kit,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/first-aid-kit/to-live-a-life-chords-2290575,"I wrote you a letter to make myself feel better
To redeem some part of me I thought I had lost
And we were a lost cause long before we fell apart
'Cause honey, I was too eager and you were too smart
Yet I look for you in these empty rooms
You're a phone call away, I'm on the interstate
And I been drinking cheap wine just to pass the time
I'm falling behind and it doesn't matter
Who you are    to meee
I'm just like my mother, we both love to run
Chase impossible things or unreachable dreams
Lie awake in the night thinking this can't be right
But there is no other way to live a life alone
I'm alone now
Then suddenly we wake from this dream that we have made
It hits you all at once and then it slowly fades
I'm racing into nothing now, it all falls away
I know it now for my own sake that I cannot stay

3,Not Good At Not,Morgan Wallen,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/morgan-wallen/not-good-at-not-chords-2323025,"Maybe it's your bad girl, underneath that sweet smile
Like a peak of black lace that nobody but me sees
Just a trace of all the possibilities
Maybe it's the quarter moon, maybe it's the quart of wine
That we haven't even touched yet, baby don't need it
Everything you're doing, girl is my weakness
I'm not good at not kissin' again
When you're leanin' it on in a little closer
I'm not good at not getting sidetracked when your tank top strap's slippin' off of your shoulder
Ohhh, girl, I try to be, but I ain't that tough
I'm not good at not fallin' in love, fallin' in love, fallin' in love
You know what you're doin' girl
You know what it does to me
When you turn on that song, and turn the lights down
Baby I'm gone, before the part about you
Dancin' in slow motion with my hands on your hips
Now you got me going right where I can't resist
I'm not good at not kissin' again
When you're leanin' it on in a little closer
I'm not good at not getting sidetracked when your tank top strap's slippin' off of your shoulder
Ohhh, girl, I try to be, but I ain't that tough
I'm not good at not fallin' in love, fallin' in love, fallin' in love
Can't tell you no
Can't say goodbye
Can't hold a little bit back even if I tried
'Cause when I look in your eyes
I'm not good at not kissin' again
When you're leanin' it on in a little closer
I'm not good at not getting sidetracked when your tank top strap's slippin' off of your shoulder
Ohhh, girl, I try to be, but I ain't that tough

Into the darkness where my deamons reside
That's where I felt at home: in the world unknown.
And big blue ocean carry his heart back again
And tell his lover he's thinking of her
I missed the train you're on out of Babylon
Ya know I love you still
And I always will
Oh sweeet silence I pray for the end
Of my sentence in my prison-like skin
Every word you ever said echos in my head
And big blue ocean carry his heart back again
And tell his lover he's thinking of her
I missed the train you're on out of Babylon
Ya know I love you still
And I always will
Broken arrow, flyin' through the night
And pierce my heartstrings 'till my body does die
Or at least promise me you'll be back some old time
And big blue ocean carry his heart back again
And tell his lover he's thinking of her
I missed the train you're on out of Babylon
Ya know I love you still
And I always will

Haven't been early since '88
Texas is hot, I can be cold
Grandma cried when I pierced my nose
Good in a glass, good on green
Good when you're putting your hands all over me
I'm alright with a slow burn
Taking my time, let the world turn
I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright
If we burn it down and it takes all night
It's a slow burn, yeah
In Tennessee, the sun's goin' down
But in Beijing, they're heading out to work
You know the bar down the street don't close for an hour
We should take a walk and look at all the flowers
'Cause I'm alright with a slow burn
Taking my time, let the world turn
I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright
If we burn it down and it takes all night
It's a slow burn
Whatever feels good
Old soul, waiting my turn
I know a few things, but I still got a lot to learn
So I'm alright with a slow burn
slow burn
slow burn
I'm alright with a slow burn
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you
Monday, I was gone, and Tuesday, you were working late
Wednesday went to hell, then Thursday kinda had the wait, yeah
Friday, you were leavin', goin' out of town again
I should see what's goin' on, only got a couple friends

Guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend, yeah
I got a million things to do, but I haven't done a single one, no
And if my sister lived in town, I know that we'd be doin' something fun
I keep lookin' at my phone, puttin' it back down
There's a little part of me that's got the fear of missin' out, and
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend (So lonely)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely feelin' without you

Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)

It's alright to be alone sometimes, sometimes

Guess everybody else is out tonight (Out tonight)
Guess I'm hangin' by myself, but I don't mind (I don't mind)
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend
It's a lo-, it's a lo-, it's a lonely weekend
I was just coastin'
Never really goin' anywhere
Caught up in a web
I was gettin' kinda used to stayin' there
And o-o-out of the blue
I-I-I fell for you
Now you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
Stealin' my heart 'stead of stealin' my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies
You give me butterflies
Kiss full of color
Makes me wonder where you've always been
I was hidin' in doubt
'Til you brought me out of my chrysalis
And I-I-I came out new
A-a-all because of you
Now you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
Stealin' my heart 'stead of stealin' my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies
You give me butterflies
Now you're lifting me up 'stead of holding me down
Takin' my hand 'stead of takin' my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies
You give me butterflies
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe
Northern lights in our skies
Plants that grow and open your mind
Things that swim with a neon glow
How we all got here, nobody knows
These are real things
These are real things
Oh, what a world, don't wanna leave
All kinds of magic all around us; it's hard to believe
Thank God it's not too good to be true
Oh, what a world, and then there is you
Did I know you once in another life?
Are we here just once or a billion times?
Well, I wish I knew, but it doesn't matter
'Cause you're here right now, and I know what I feel
These are real things
These are real things
Oh, what a world, don't wanna leave
All kinds of magic all around us; it's hard to believe
Thank God it's not too good to be true
Oh, what a world, and then there is you
Oh, and then there is you
These are real things
These are real things
Oh, what a world, all kinds of magic
Tell me it's not too good to be true
Oh, what a world, and then there is you
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe
Oh, what a world, I don't wanna leave
There's all kinds of magic; it's hard to believe
Bursting with empathy, I'm feeling everything
The weight of the world on my shoulders
Hope my tears don't freak you out
They're just kinda coming out
It's the music in me and all of the colors
Wish we didn't live, wish we didn't live so far from each other
I'm just sitting here thinking 'bout the time that's slipping
And missing my mother, mother
And she's probably sitting there
Thinking 'bout the time that's slipping
And missing her mother, mother
You can't find it sitting on a shelf in a store
If you try to hide it, it's gonna shine even more
Even if you lose it, it will find you
There's no way to stop it, but they'll try to
Running like a river trying to find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences, blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing
Oh, I can feel it, magic in your fingertips
And I can hear it in the words coming off your lips
Even if you lose me, I will find you
There's no way to stop it, so don't try to
Running like a river trying to find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences, blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
Love is a wild thing
I used to be scared of the wilderness, of the dark
But not anymore, anymore, no
Running like a river trying to find the ocean
Flowers in the concrete
Climbing over fences, blooming in the shadows
Places that you can't see
Coming through the melody when the night bird sings
                  Love is a wild thing
Love is a wild thing
Love is a wild thing, yeah
You look out the window
While I look at you
Sayin' I don't know
Would be like saying that the sky ain't blue
And boots weren't made for sitting by the door
Since you don't wanna stay anymore
You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on ride away, in your Silverado
Guess I'll see you 'round again
I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does too
Yeah, we had our day in the sun, when a horse wants to run,
There ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space, cowboy
After the gold rush, there ain't no reason to stay
Shoulda learned from the movies that good guys don't run away
But roads weren't made to not go down
There ain't room for both of us in this town
So you can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on ride away, in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does too
We had our day in the sun, when a horse wants to run,
There ain't no sense in closing the gate
So you can have your space, cowboy
You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on ride away, in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does too
Oh, we had our day in the sun, when a horse wants to run,
Ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space
Yeah, you can have your space
You can have your space
Cowboy
It's not you, it's the glow of the party The way that you've got me
lit up inside
It's the song that they're playin', the words that you're sayin'
It's never felt so right
And I'm the kind of person who starts getting kinda nervous
When I'm having the time of my life
Is there a word for the way that I'm feeling tonight?
Happy and sad at the same time
You got me smiling with tears in my eyes
No, I've never been this far off of the ground
And they say everything that goes up must come down
But I don't wanna come down
So is there a way to stop all this thinkin', just keep on drinkin'?
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
When they're turnin' the lights on and it turns out the joke's on me
'Cause it feels so right
And I'm the kind of person who starts getting kinda nervous
When I'm having the time of my life
Is there a word for the way that I'm feeling tonight?
Happy and sad at the same time
You got me smilin' with tears in my eyes
No, I've never been this far off of the ground
And they say everything that goes up must come down
But I don't wanna come down
I don't mind at all, no, I'm used to fallin'
I'm comfortable when the sky is gray
But when everything is perfect, I start hidin'
'Cause I know that rain is comin' my way, my way
'Cause I'm happy and sad at the same time
You got me smilin' with tears in my eyes
I never felt so high
No, never been this far off of the ground
And they say everything that goes up, goes up must come down
And I don't wanna come down
No, I don't wanna come down
All I ever wanted was something classic
The kind love song that goes on 'til the end of time
All I ever wanted was a little magic
With a good laugh, jet-black sparkle in his eyes
You're my velvet Elvis, I ain't never gonna take you down
Making everybody jealous when they step into my house
Soft to the touch, feels like love, knew it as soon as I felt it
You're my velvet Elvis, baby
I don't really care 'bout the Mona Lisa
I need a Graceland kind of man who's always on my mind
I wanna show you off every evening
Go out with you in powder blue and tease my hair up high
You're my velvet Elvis, I ain't never gonna take you down
Making everybody jealous when they step into my house
Soft to the touch, feels like love, knew it as soon as I felt it
You're my velvet Elvis, baby
You're my velvet Elvis, baby
I knew it as soon as I felt it
Mm-mm, I knew it as soon as I felt it
Yeah
You're my velvet Elvis, I ain't never gonna take you down
Making everybody jealous when they step into my house
Soft to the touch, feels like love, knew it as soon as I felt it
You're my velvet Elvis, baby
You're my velvet Elvis, baby, yeah
I like where this is going, and you like it, too
We rarely never ever don't see eye to eye
We're going to
I can show you strong, I can fight for you
I can try to move mountains if you want me to
But, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman
I don't know how to lasso the love out of you
Don't you know I'm only human?
And if I let you down, I don't mean to
All I need's a place to land
I don't need a Superman to win my lovin'
'Cause, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman
Bet all that gold gets heavy weighin' on her
I wonder if it's scary, always tryin' not to get hurt
I know how it feels, it ain't easy
There's a reason why you only see it in the movies
Cause, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman
I don't know how to lasso the love out of you
Don't you know I'm only human?
And if I let you down, I don't mean to
All I need's a place to land
I don't need a Superman to win my lovin'
You don't know how to fly, no
That's okay, neither do I
But, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman
I don't know how to lasso the love out of you
Don't you know I'm only human?
And if I let you down, I don't mean to
All I need's a place to land
I don't need a Superman to win my lovin'
'Cause, baby, I ain't Wonder Woman
Yeah, I know I ain't Wonder Woman
Oh, I bet you think you're John Wayne
Showing up and shooting down everybody
You're classic in the wrong way
And we all know the end of the story
'Cause everyone knows someone who kills the buzz
Every time they open up their mouth
Yeah, everyone knows someone who knows someone
Who thinks they're cooler than everybody else
And I think we've seen enough, seen enough
To know that you ain't ever gonna come down
So, why don't you giddy up, giddy up
And ride straight out of this town
You and your high horse
You and your high horse
I bet you think you're first place
Yeah, someone should give you a ribbon
And put you in the hall of fame
For all the games that you think that you're winning
'Cause everyone knows someone who kills the buzz
Every time they open up their mouth
Yeah, everyone knows someone who knows someone
Who thinks they're cooler than everybody else
And I think we've seen enough, seen enough

Darling, you take the high horse and I'll take the high road
If you’re too good for us, you’ll be good riding solo

And ride straight out of this town

All that I know is you caught me at the right time
Keep me in your glow
'Cause I'm having such a good time with you
Baby, don't you know?
The colour of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
I used to get sad and lonely when the sun went down
But it's different now
'Cause I love the light that I've found in you
Baby, don't you know?
The colour of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
You make the world look beautiful, ooh
I thought I'd seen it all before
But looking through your eyes, it looks like paradise
You've set my world on fire, and I know everything's gonna be alright
The colour of my sky
You've set my world on fire
And I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
Yeah, I know, I know everything's gonna be alright
Golden hour
When it rains it pours, but you didn't even noticed
It ain't raining anymore, it's hard to breathe when all you know is
The struggle of staying above the rising water line
The sky is finally open, rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same old storm again
Hold tight to your umbrella, darling I'm just trying to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hanging over your head
If you could see what I see, you'd be blinded by the colors
Yellow, red and orange and green, and at least a million others
Tie up the bow, take off your coat, and take a look around
The sky is finally open, rain and wind stopped blowin'
But you're stuck out in the same old storm again
Hold tight to your umbrella, darling I'm just trying to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hanging over your head
So, tie up the bow, take off your coat, and take a look around
Everything is alright now
'Cause the sky is finally open, rain and wind stopped blowing
But you're stuck out in the same old storm again
Let go of your umbrella, darling I'm just trying to tell ya
That there's always been a rainbow hanging over your head
There's always been a rainbow hanging over your head

Let it burn you to sleep
And bring you closer to danger
To surrender and retreat

Or going back upon your promise after fighting for the right

Are paper tigers now

Are making you more and more alone

She never missed a note
Took a breath and cleared her throat
And wrapped him in a Carhartt coat she found out in my ride

I was barefoot in December
When I hit the door again it really came alive
That was all she wrote in a 30 second note
I got out with a photograph and my old auto 5
Lord knows that I've been blessed
I can stand up to the test
I can live on so much less
This much I've been learning
Feel a pounding in my chest
I'm fearful I'll confess
How am I to get my rest?
The house I built is burning
Well Lorrie called the volunteers
Siren music to my ears
First I've been glad to hear the flashing red and blue
Can't repay the time they gave
There was nothing left to save
Shake all of their hands and waved
They did all they could do
Lord knows that I've been blessed
I can stand up to the test
I can live on so much less
This much I've been learning
Forgive my cowardice
I'm fearful I'll confess
How am I to get my rest?
The house I built is burning
We snuck away two nights ago
Rode around the logging roads
We been stuck in a motor home about to fall apart
We finally made a go
Got dealt a heavy blow

  The light would flicker like a violent womb
  The night was thicker than a smokey fume
Eliza     waited in the room
  Benny loved her like he loved no one
  The way she'd laugh and hold a smoking gun
  The way she always said what's done is done
And he    was not the only one
Love is a gentle thing
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring
  A victim healer with a sharp sharp blade
  Benny knew how she was getting paid
Her water broke and they would have to wade
  When he knew that she was fooling
  He faced the mirror to avoid the thing
  We're outta money and we sold the bling
And I just    wanna  take you home, 
I just    wanna  take you home
Love is a gentle thing
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring
Yours is thicker than a velvet ring
And I am wandering
I am wandering﻿

I don't wanna be here anymore
You're wasted and I'm bored
I suppose I'll show myself back to the door
Do you remember yesterday?
Did the conversation we had about life just float away?
I sat you down, I chose to say
You're gonna be better off without me in the way
You see everybody running around losing their mind
You wanted me to hang around and now I'm losing mine
A thousand days and you'll be doing fine
Without me,   without me
Life is wonderful on my own
A million hours left to waste in a warm window
But all I ever wanna do is fall in love
To reconvene with every dream that I've been dreaming of
You see everybody running around with their head in the clouds
All of us are doing our best to figure it out
A thousand tears and you'll be doing fine
Without me,   without me
Every night I'm growing colder
And every moon I'm feeling older
The cavalier is burning through my heart
I never wanna be alone
But I here I am pacing round my empty home
All in all, it's nothing without love
Lately I've been thinking about you
All the curiosities near and far
What colour is your hair?
How I miss the way you stare
And do you still drive around your golden car?
Do the birds still sing outside your window?
Or is the mandolin I gave you still in tune?
To this day you've never tried to get in touch with me
And I've never tried to get in touch with you
You see everybody running around in a crazy crowd
It's hard to hear when everyone's shouting out
A broken heart is never hard to find
But darling is it yours or is it mine?
All in all, I hear you're doing fine

All I want is to fall in deeper
Than I've ever been, Why won't you let me?
I can handle your heart so, help me
Here you are, next to me
So much beauty at my feet
All I want to do is swim
But the waves keep crashing in
No I'm not afraid to drown
Take me out, take me down
I'm so tired of the shore
Let me in, baby
You're an ocean beautiful and blue
I wanna swim in you 
Like a lighthouse up and shining bright
Through the dark for the both of us
And I’ve done it out of love, it’s not enough
But God, how I wish it was
And I don't wanna find out
How much lonely I can take before you lose me
Baby look at me and swear you won't lose me
Here you are, next to me
So much beauty at my feet
All I want to do is swim
But the waves keep crashing in
No I'm not afraid to drown
Take me out, take me down
I'm so tired of the shore
Let me in, baby
You're an ocean beautiful and blue
I wanna swim in you
I can't let it go
For moments in your arms
But they come back again
The waves, the waves, the waves, the waves
The waves, the waves, the waves, the waves
Here you are, next to me
So much beauty at my feet
All I want to do is swim
But the waves keep crashing in
No I'm not afraid to drown
Take me out, take me down
I'm so tired of the shore
Let me in, baby
You're an ocean beautiful and blue
I wanna swim in you

Shotguns a singing
A pointing dog down in the old logging road
Danny got three
And looked back a grinning
I fumbled around and I tried to reload
The country was cold
With the sun westward sinking
It's good to be back in this place
With my hands around
A Belgian made Browning
My mind on the lines of her face
Well now Danny's my buddy
We grew up like family
Hunted this timber before we could drive
The old English pointer
He once belonged to me
But I gave him up when I moved in '05
Off with the girl
Off to the city
Off on a wing and a chance
Hell I thought it'd play out
Just like some story
We fell in love at a rodeo dance
She said go on back to Cherokee County
Won't you crawl back with nothing but a razor and a comb
Babe, if you need me, I'll be where you found me
Go on to hell, honey, I'm headed home
Dan says, ""Look at old Jim
A dozen Decembers
Behind him no worse for the wear
And your time spent in Tulsa
Did not help your shooting
And look at the gray in your hair
How good does it feel?
You belong in these hills
It's best that you let it all end
If you'd have married that girl
You'd have married her family
You dodged a bullet my friend""

And a flutter of feathers
Then a shotgun to shoulder

She'll be home on the Fourth of July
I bet we'll dance on the Fourth of July

Looks like you've still got it
That's what we came here to do
It's light enough still
At the foot of the hill
We could kick up a single or two""

Told me I'd seen a ghost

Ships will rust in Baldwin Bay (Let me go!)
No one trusts what I say (I don't know!)
Oh my God, no one paid  (Attention!)

And when you do, I'll be hangin' around.

I've been through hell and found myself on the wrong end of a gun

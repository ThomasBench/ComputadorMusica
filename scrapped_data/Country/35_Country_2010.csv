0,Another New World (ver 2),Punch Brothers,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/punch-brothers/another-new-world-chords-1682521,"The leading lights of the age all wondered amongst themselves what I would do next,
After all that I'd found, in my travels around the world, was there anything left?
""Gentlemen,"" I said, ""I've studied the charts, and if what I am thinking is right,
There's another new world, at the top of the world, for the first one who breaks through the ice,""
I looked 'round the room, in that way I once had, and I saw that they wanted belief,
So I said, ""All I've got are my guts and my God,"" then I paused, ""and the Annabel Lee.""
Oh, the Annabel Lee, I saw their eyes shine, the most beautiful ship in the sea,
My Nina, my Pinta, my Santa Maria, my beautiful Annabel Lee
That spring we set sail, the crowds waved from the shore, and on board the crew waved their hats,
But I'd never had family, just the Annabel Lee, so I never had cause to look back.
I just set the course north and I studied the charts, and towards dawn I drifted toward sleep,
And I dreamed of the fine, deep harbor I'd find past the ice, for my Annabel Lee.
After that it got colder, the world got quiet. It was never quite day or quite night.
And the sea turned the color of sky turned the color of sea turned the color of ice.
Till at last all around us was fastness, one vast glassy desert of arsenic white,
And the waves that once lifted us, shifted instead into drifts against Annabel's sides.
And the crew gathered closer, At first for the warmth, but each day would bring a new set
Of tracks in the snow, leading over the edge of the world, til I was the only one left.
Then it gets cloudy, But it feels like I laid there for days, or maybe for months
But Annabel held me, the two of us happy, Just to think back on all we had done
We talked of the other new worlds We'd discover as she gave up her body to me,
As I chopped up her mainsail for timber, I told her of all that we still had to see.
As the frost turned her moorings to nine-tails and the wind lashed her sides in the cold,
I burned her to keep me alive every night in the loving embrace of her hold.
And I won't call it rescue, That brought me back here to the old world to drink and decline,
And pretend that the search for another new world was well worth the burning of mine.
But sometimes at night, in my dreams, Comes the singing of some unknown tropical bird,
And I smile in my sleep, Thinking Annabel Lee's finally made it to another new world.
Yeah, sometimes at night in my dreams comes the singing of some unknown tropical bird,
And I smile in my sleep, thinking Annabel Lee's finally made it to another new world.

1,Country Must Be Country Wide,Brantley Gilbert,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/brantley-gilbert/country-must-be-country-wide-chords-1070749,"I grew up south of the Mason Dixon
Workin' spittin' huntin' and fishin'
Stone cold country by the grace of God
I was gasin' up the other day
And an ol' boy pulled up with a license plate
From Ohio I thought of good lord he's lost
From his wranglers to his boots
He reminded me of Chris LeDoux
And that Copenhagen smile
Country must be country wide
In every state
There's a station
Playin' Cash, Hank, Willie, and Waylon
In foreign cars and four wheel drives
There's cowboys and hillbillies
From farm towns to big cities
There ain't no doubt in my mind
It ain't where
We weren't raised to take
The shirt off our back
We bow our heads before we eat
Before we start our day

And we see what's wrong
And we know what's right

I'd love to hear ""you're killing it, dude"", yeah it's bit a long time
Since I hit one out of the park or nailed it as they say
I guess I've been in a dry spell but that's about to change

I'll be done with my third can of cold Bud Light
And I'll be crushin' it, yeah I'll be crushin' it

You know the ones she framed late last spring of you and her in Florida
You're up on the ladder when it shatters into smithereens
She shakes her head, looks at you and says
""Ain't you good for anything?"" and you say
Cause every week has a weekend, by this time Friday night
You want a margarita, Ill get tequila and ice
And I'll be crushin' it, with a cold one in my other hand
I'll be crushin' it, when I'm finished with my can
I can stomp it with my boot, crunch it with my fist
Smash it on my forehead, yeah I got this
I'll be crushin' it, oh I'll be crushin' it

That I was gonna probably wind up somewhere near the

Get away from it all and find what’s real
If we don’t get out now the chance won’t reappear
We can run away
Hold me tight and don’t let go
Sweet and soft no one will know
We can run away

You came along, gave it back to me
Now we’re creatures of the night, we set each other free
Run away with me
Hold me tight and don’t let go
Sweet and soft no one will know
We can run away
Lay with me down by the riverside
Stars in the sky shining in your eyes

Our troubles are gone, now it seems like such a breeze
Just remember all the storms we weathered

Just stand here side by side

We'll be young forever

Guess I didn't know I was looking for you

You were California beautiful
I was playin' everything but cool

We had our first dance in the sand
It was one hell of a souvenir
Tangled up, so in love
So, let's just stay right here

She flies from pine to pine
So I'll take wing, mourn and sing

Second hand tires with poor boy tread
Made a lot of almost love in the bed of that
Truck that got stuck a lot
Just letter jacket boys singing Jerry Jeff songs
Drinking everything we could get our hands on
Learning 'bout right by doin' it wrong
Hopin' we didn't get caught
And we spent what little bit of money we had
On wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
Go get your girl, go make the drag
If you're lucky you can take her cross the rail road tracks
Where the man in the moon works his magic
On the second runner up of the 4H pageant
Seems like yester- day even though
That was fourteen hundred and fifty two beers ago
Skipped that town on my birthday
For eighteen years I was headed that way
Where old red stopped I just stayed
In a room without a view
I met a one look girl in a two bit bar
I had a place, she had a car
I won her heart with my guitar
I sang her the homesick blues
And we spent what little bit of money we had
On wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
Go get your girl, go make the drag
If you're lucky you can take her cross the rail road tracks

I learned to lope, rope and dally, on the S lazy H
Well the roots of my people, they run deep on this place 
I am sixth generation on the S lazy H
When it came to the future, I never gave it a thought
If there were broncs to be broken, endless steers to be caught
Well my youth, it was carefree, for the work was my play
And what I loved would always be there on the S lazy H
I had one beloved sister a few years younger than me
Before a sole cowboy had kissed her, she left for school in the East
Me I might have gone to college, might have liked to fly planes
But my dad, he needed help to run the S lazy H
So I worked there long-side him, put adult years in this place 
And I gained appreciation, for the lines on his face
And when mom had grown older, and when dad passed away
It fell to me to look after the S lazy H
By now my sister she had married a sharp attorney back East
We didn’t see eye to eye but, I did my best to make peace 
What did they see when they looked over, over the fence one fine day
They saw a whole lot of value in the S lazy H
So after thought and assessment, the court awarded them half
And no cow-calf operation carries that kind of cash
Well I worked through the numbers, worked them every which way
Yeah I went through the numbers, oh and boys I’m afraid
I had to sell twenty sections of the S lazy H
Sometimes right isn’t equal, sometimes equal’s not fair
There will soon be rows of houses on that ridge over there
Many lifetimes of labor will be all but erased 
So shed a tear and look skyward, God help the S lazy H
The last few years were a struggle, but I gave it my best
And I tried to go forward on the land that was left
I have lived with the sorrow and I will die with the shame
For now the bank owns what’s left of the S lazy H

Cause time it does kill the last of my will to see through my reckless eyes
If you should go yours and I should go mine we'll meet in heaven or hell
We never cared for much in between of the world we desperately dwell
Oooo, How I loved you in the dawn
Oooo, but our souls they drift apart
Oooo, we must carry on again
Oooo , carry on my dearest friend
The moon shines on the porch of the train as i bid New Orleans goodbye
It reminds me again of the man that I am and the thought brings tears to my eyes
The miles between your heart and mine don't lessen the love we share
So if I should fail or die or prevail my fate is yours to bear
Oooo, How I loved you in the dawn
Oooo, but our souls they drift apart
Oooo, we must carry on again
Oooo , carry on my dearest friend
I'm weary and tired I've nearly expired as the bottle's killed in the end
Your face comes to mind and I smile and sigh as I ride on again
Oooo, How I loved you in the dawn
Oooo, but our souls they drift apart
Oooo, we must carry on again
Oooo , carry on my dearest friend

When the tightrope walker slipped into the moon glow
Saying all my children, follow me
Maybe it's time to go.
You can be cruel when you're wise
You can be wise when you're blue
And baby, if I have
Then I have for you
Bribing the jury to keep me in jail
Singing tea for the tiller man
And although I lie fantastically
This woman knows of my history
It's a miracle i can see
You can be wrong when you're right
Even when you're right on cue
And if I die tonight
Then I die for you
All I know is they call me son
Great grandson and grandson
Great uncles aunts and relatives
That judge what I have done
Gonna make it right by you
Even if it's all I do
And if it's all I do
Then I do it for you
People have raised a whole lotta hell
About the water in the windmill
And although I stab chaotically 
It hurts no one but me
Even the darkness has arms
But they ain't got you
And baby, I have it
And I have you, too
And the light in the window
To pass the night through
Maybe so uncertain
But what can I do
Keeping it on
Keeping it on
And I know I like it
But what does that prove
Sometimes I worry I don't know how to love you
I bring to you with reverent hand
All the books and the lullabies
The kind woman that my passion wore
Like the shoreline wears the tides
Maybe the water went dry
Keeping an eye on you
And with an eye on you
It could drown me too
People have raised a whole lotta hell
About the water in the windmill
And although I stab Quixotically
I swore an oath on my history
It's a miracle i can see
Even the darkness has arms
But they ain't got you
And baby, I have it
And I have you, too
And the light in the window
To pass the night through
Maybe so uncertain
But what can I do
Keeping it on
Keeping it on
And I know I like it

Sometimes I worry I don't know how to love you

where regrets outlast the alcohol.

Just an old country boy, wearing my Osh-Kosh boots
Walked by the trailer factory, every day on my way to school
Early on in life, the only thing I wanted to do
Was buy me a trailer and move it down to Grandview

Got out of high school, got on at Whirlpool
Bought me a car, two guitars and everything
Me and Patty were falling in love before the summer was through
I started thinking about trailers and high lots in Grandview

It was a scorchin' summer night, we just left the dairy bar
We was sittin' out on Ridgeland Road in the front seat of my car
I said ""Patty, if you marry me babe, I'll take good care of you
I'll buy a brand new trailer and move it into Grandview""

She said ah, ""Your wedding song, it sounds real nice
And I could sure get off on sleeping with you at night
But I tell 'ya what baby, you want me, here's what 'ya do
I want a brick home like my mother's, ain't movin' down to Grandview""     Yeah  
That's what she told me

There's been a lot of years, a lot of debts, a lot of pain
Our youngest baby's movin' out when she gets married next spring
When the bash is over, I'll tell you what I'm going to do
I got my trailer picked out, gonna move it down to Grandview

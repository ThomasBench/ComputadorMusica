0,Born To Fly (ver 2),Sara Evans,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/sara-evans/born-to-fly-chords-2063949,"[Verse]
I've been telling my dreams to the scarecrow
About the places that I'd like to see
I said friend do you think I'll ever get there?
Ah, but he just stands there smilin' back at me
So I confessed my sins to the preacher
About the love I've been prayin' to find
Is there a brown eyed boy in my future
He says, girl you've got nothin' but time
But how do you wait for heaven
And who has that much time
And how do you keep your feet on the ground
When you know, that you were born, you were born to fly
My daddy he's grounded like the oak tree
My momma she is steady as the sun
Oh you know i love my folks
But I keep staring down the road
Just lookin' for my one chance to run
Yeah, cause I will soar away like the blackbird
I will blow in the wind like a seed
I will plant my heart in the garden of my dreams
And I will grow up where I'll wander wild and free
Oh, how do you wait for heaven
And who has that much time
And how do you keep your feet on the ground
When you know, that you were born
You were born yeah
You were born to fly
So how do you wait for heaven
And who has that much time
And how do you keep your feet on the ground
When you know, that you were born
You were born to fly, fly, fly, fly
Hey
Ooooh, oooh

1,Stealing Kisses,Faith Hill,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/faith-hill/stealing-kisses-chords-1214953,"It's late enough all you kids should be home
You remember wondering what his wife
Thought about his occupation
So he winks at you girls
And tells you all ""I'll see you later""
I was stealing kisses from a boy
Now I'm begging affection from a man
In my house dress don't you know who I am
don't you know who I am
I'm standing in your kitchen
It's late enough your husband's dinner is cold
It's probably the traffic again
Or another important meeting
And you haven't talked to an adult all day
When he finally gets in he's sure not in the mood for talking
I was stealing kisses from a boy
Now I'm begging affection from a man
In my house dress don't you know who I am
don't you know who I am
I'm standing in your kitchen
And hours become days and days become years
And you could burn down this town
Buy you're no worse off than anybody else
Hey don't you even know, don't you even know yourself
So you're standing outside your high school door
And you whisper to all of the girls, run, run, run
I was stealing kisses from a boy
Now I'm begging affection from a man
In my house dress don't you know who I am
don't you know who I am

I caught frogs and called them prince
And made myself a queen
And before you knew me I'd traveled 'round the world
And I slept in castles
And fell in love
Because I was taught to dream

To capture Tinker Bell
And they were just fireflies to the untrained eye
But I could always tell
Cause I believe in fairy tales
And dreamer's dreams
Like bedsheet sails
And I believe in Peter Pan
And miracles, anything I can to get by
And fireflies
Now before I grew up I saw you on a cloud
And I could bless myself in your name
And pat you on your wings
And before I grew up I heard you whisper so loud
Well life is hard and so is love
Child, believe in all these things
I found mayonnaise bottles and poked holes on top
To capture Tinker Bell
And they were just fireflies to the untrained eye
But I could always tell

Every face is a cartoon.
 Everybody's stoned on pride
And drunk on cheap champagne.
 Tonight this joie de vivre
Sure don't live up to it's name.
Now all I can say
is I'd give this world to you
Every rock and every stone
Every masterpiece in Rome
And if you'd ask me to
I'd steal the Mona Lisa
Tear it up in little pieces
And lay them at your feet
For all the world to see.
But tonight I can't give you

ever since you've gone

won't leave me alone

None found alive

And blood on my jeans

Roll off in a crooked line
where the red tails dive

Make me smile or drive me mad, like she does 
It's like a curse that is the cure 
Better or worse, one thing's for sure 
It's real love 
And i don't know what i'd do if i lost it 
Well the honeymoon ended and life began 
Jobs and bills, losing touch with friends 
And that apartment got smaller everyday 
Then one night the walls finally closed in 
I came home late, she said where have you been 
You used to call and tell me you're on your way 
She said if this is how its gonna be then i quit 
She walked out the door, I lost it...

One day wakin' up,      oh, in a real love

I was spending dollars and making dimes
We were overdrawn, and barely hanging on

With tears in your eyes and an EPT and said

It was Little League, but what a big game
There were two men on and one man out
I got a fastball hangin' outside
I swung that bat with all my might
And the ball was gone, they say I knocked the cover off
It was the only homer that I ever had, you shoulda seen my dad
And there ain't nobody gonna take that from me as long as I'm holdin' on
Heaven wouldn't ask it of me, the devil on a good day ain't that strong
I'm keepin' it here inside me as long as I live and breathe

And there ain't nobody gonna take that from me

Movin' TVs on a loading dock
'Til the boss said, ""Son, try to lose every seventh one
I got it worked out with a good friend
Keep your mouth shut, and we'll cut you in
Now what do you say, don't you want to be rich one day""

And there ain't nobody gonna take that from me as long as I'm holdin' on

And there ain't nobody gonna take that from me

Then somehow, out of nowhere, something sneaks up to re  mind me
Like this mornin', I woke up to a little voice that spoke up
Sayin', ""Daddy, please, fix a bowl of Rice Krispies

Runnin' scared with his devils, sayin' prayers all through the night
But mercy can't find him, not in the shadows where he calls
Forsaking all his better angels: That's how every empire falls
The bells ring out on Sunday morning like echoes from another time
All our innocence and yearning and sense of wonder left behind
Oh gentle hearts remember, What was that story? Is it lost?
For when religion loses vision, That's how every empire falls
He toasts his wife and all his family, the providence he brought to bear
They raise their glasses in his honor although this union they don't share
A man who lives among them was still a stranger to them all
For when the heart is never open, That's how every empire falls
Padlock the door and board the windows, put the people in the street
""It's just my job,"" he says, ""I'm sorry,"" and draws a check, goes home to eat
At night he tells his woman, ""I know I hide behind the laws""
She says, ""You're only taking orders"": That's how every empire falls
A bitter wind blows through the country, a hard rain falls on the sea

That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.
'Twas grace, that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved.
How precious did that grace appear,
The hour I first believed.
Through many dangers, toils and snares,
I have already come.
'Tis grace hath brought me safe, thus far,
And grace will lead me home.
When we've been there ten thousand years,
bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise,
Than when we'd first begun.

It must be a full moon, cause their all out tonight
All the insecure boys in their muscle cars,
Young girls in their pushup bras under neon lights
They come here for freedom, freedom from anything
And for miles and miles down this road, you can hear them sing
With their voices, and their engines, and their pounding radios
It seems like round here, no one knows
No one knows that there's more
Beyond these dead skies and these filthy streets
Take my hand and let me pull you
Out of the blindness of your weary soul
To somewhere beautiful
To somewhere beautiful
Is there any way to learn from what you've been told
Or do you really have to hold the experience
Cause you can heed me now, and come out clean
Trust me, I could spare you the consequence
I can tell by your eyes, that there ain't no getting through
Cause you're hell bent on doing exactly what you've gotta do
So welcome to a long line of sinners and saints
Is there anyone around here who ain't
Don't you know that there's more
Beyond these dead skies and these filthy streets
Take my hand and let me pull you
Out of the blindness of your weary soul
To somewhere beautiful
To somewhere beautiful
Don't you know that there's more
Beyond these dead skies and these filthy streets
Take my hand and let me pull you
Out of the blindness of your weary soul
To somewhere beautiful

Don't you know that there's more

I'll draw all the curtains and unplug the phone

Swallow your feelings and stagger and swear
You can show things and throw things and I wouldn't care
You can cry if you want to
No I won't make fun of you I won't tell anyone
I won't analyze what you do or you should have done
I won't advise you to go and have fun

I can't feel what you feel but I know it feels bad

Sheepskin cloak across his back
A preacher man with kind old eyes
And a mystery for a past
He said he'd come to teach about
The love of God
But he soon learned what they were missing there
Was justice and the law
There was a cattleman who claimed his clan
Owned all the land around
And any brave fool who that might dispute
He was quick to snuff 'em out
He'd say take my heed
And you won't pay the price
'Cause honor and a name ain't worth a damn
If you don't have your life
He'd say ain't nobody faster
Than this cattleman's gun
I'm a rattlesnake on the trigger
Your last stand'll be lyin' in the sand
Fallin' to the slam of my hammer
So one man taught forgiveness
While the other taught suffering
The preacher said deliverance
Could be found down on their knees
He said I know that you want justice
And you want blood
But believe me when I say to you
Don't try and be that man's judge
He'd say ain't nobody faster
Than this cattleman's gun
I'm a rattlesnake on the trigger
Your last stand'll be lyin' in the sand
Fallin' to the slam of my hammer
One day a young farmer
Brought his sons to town for feed
And he noticed that the streets were quiet
And he knew what that might mean
The smoke rose in the distance
His farm burned to the ground
He let the fury overtake him
When Cattleman came back to town.
Those boys ran out from behind the crowd
And watched their daddy die
The big man laughed and said now look at that
Anybody else wanna give it a try
Well, the church doors opened
With that black cloak flowin'
Behind the preacher's fiery eyes
He said your ticket to Hell is a comin' to you
And I got a hollow-point to give you the ride
And the only thing faster
Than the cattleman's gun
Was the preacher man's hand and finger
He pulled iron from his side
And let that bullet fly
Beat the rattlesnake to the hammer
While the preacher embraced forgiveness
Oh they finally understood...
Under that sheepskin cloak of his
Was a history of blood...

Voices of heaven I hear them sing
It blooms its white blossoms the day he was born 
And I love my Lord Jesus above anything

Someone that loves you more than life right here.
You got willin' arms that will hold you tight
A hand to lead you all through the night right here.
I know your heart can get all tangled up inside,
Don't you keep it to yourself.
When your long day is over
And you can barely drag your feet.
The weight of the world is on your shoulders,
I know what you need, 
Bring it on home to me.  
Whoa I know, I know you like the back of my hand
But you know I'm goin' to do all that I can right here. 
I'm goin' to lie with you 'till you fall asleep,
When the mornin' comes I'm still goin' to be right 
here,  yes I am.
So take your worries and just drop them at the door,
Baby leave it all behind.

And you can barely drag your feet.

Bring it on home to me.

Don't let the water come and carry you away.

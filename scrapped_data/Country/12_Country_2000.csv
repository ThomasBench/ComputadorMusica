0,Never Meant To Be,Tony Rice,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tony-rice/never-meant-to-be-chords-2653014,"In the darkness of the night, all I hear is a ringing in my ears
And my eyes are full of tears that I can't see
And I'll see comfort in bad places, and I'm trying to forget the faces
But the many friends will say, that it was never meant to be
And you can always write it off by saying, that it was never meant to be
Though you once told me we'd always be as one.
And then you wish me a better day, as you turn your back away
Then you write it off by saying, ""it was never meant to be.""
Well, it left some damage in my wake, but I have the liberty to take the time to say
""It ain't all my fault alone”
I've been deceived and I've been forced to leave, my anger and my greaving
In a heart that’s still believing, it was always meant to be.""
And you can always write it off by saying, that it was never meant to be
Though you once told me we'd always be as one.
And then you wish me a better day, as you turn your back away
Then you write it off by saying, ""it was never meant to be.""
You have turned your beauty and your charme into a weapon of badly harm, the man you said,
Was the best friend you've been knowing
Then, your ways are justified, by stubborn foolish pride.
And the price is payed by me, because that’s the way it’s meant to be.
And you can always write it off by saying, that it was never meant to be
Though you once told me we'd always be as one.
And then you wish me a better day, as you turn your back away
Then you write it off by saying, ""it was never meant to be.""
There is no dignity in remaining; love ain't worth retaining, anymore
So let’s just do each other in.
And leave the sadness and the fury, the judgement of a jury
And the signature that’s saying, ""it was never meant to be.""
And you can always write it off by saying, that it was never meant to be
Though you once told me we'd always be as one.
And then you wish me a better day, as you turn your back away
Then you write it off by saying, ""it was never meant to be.""
And then you wish me a better day, as you turn your back away
Then you write it off by saying, ""it was never meant to be.""

Every day there’s a little less difference between the two
So I belly up and disappear
Well I ain’t really drowning ‘cause I see the beach from here
I could take the Greyhound home
When I got there it’d be gone
Along with everything my home is made up of
So I’ll take two of what you’re having
I’ll take all of what you got
To kill this goddamn lonely, goddamn lonely love
Sister listen to what your daddy says
Don’t be ashamed of things that hide behind your dress
Belly up and arch your back
Well I ain’t really fallin’ asleep; I’m fadin’ to black
You can come to me by plane
but it wouldn’t be the same
as that old motel room in Texarkana was
So I’ll take two of what you’re having
I’ll take all of what you got
To kill this goddamn lonely, goddamn lonely love
Stop me if you heard this one before
A man walks into a bar
And leaves before his ashes hit the floor
Stop me if I ever get that far
The sun’s a desperate star
That burns like every single one before
I could find another dream
One that keeps me warm and clean
But I ain’t dreamin’ anymore; girl I’m wakin’ up
So I’ll take two of what you’re having
I’ll take all of what you got

Chased by a floating hatchet

For things and themselves as they are
And the triumph of the obstacles
And horseleg swastikas

Looked at my life - where it's going, where it's gone

And I've watched boats sail in and out of cinnamon bay
I let go of a lover that took a piece of my heart
Prayed many times for forgiveness and a brand new start
I've read a lot of books, wrote a few songs
Looked at my life - where it's going, where it's gone

With a heavy heart, and my hat clutched in my hand
Such a foolish man, God ain't known no greater sinner
I have come in search of Jesus, hoping he will understand
If I give my soul, will he clean these clothes I'm wearin'?
If I give my soul, will he put new boots on my feet?
If I bow my head and beg God for his forgiveness
Will he breathe new breath within me and bring her back to me?
I had a woman once, she was kind and she was gentle
Had a child by me, who grew up to be a man
I had a steady job, til I started into drinkin'
Then I started makin' music travellin' with the Devil's band
Oh the years went by like a mighty rush of eagles
Our dreams and plans were all scattered in the wind
And it's a lonesome life, when you lose the ones you live for
If I make my peace with Jesus, will she take me back again?
If I give my soul, will he stop my hands from shaking?
If I give my soul, will my son love me again?
If I give my soul, and she knows I really mean it
If I give my soul to Jesus, will she take me back again?
If I give my soul, will he clean the clothes I'm wearin'
If I give my soul, will he put new boots on my feet
If I bow my head, and beg God for his forgiveness
Will he breathe new breath within me and bring her back to me?

25,The Ballad Of Love And Hate,The Avett Brothers,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-avett-brothers/the-ballad-of-love-and-hate-chords-965256,"Love writes a letter and sends it to hate.
My vacations ending. I'm coming home late.
The weather was fine and the ocean was great
and I can't wait to see you again.
Hate reads the letter and throws it away.
""No one here cares if you go or you stay.
I barely even noticed that you were away.
I'll see you or I won't, whatever.""
Love sings a song as she sails through the sky.
The water looks bluer through her pretty eyes.
And everyone knows it whenever she flies,
and also when she comes down.
Hate keeps his head up and walks through the street.
Every stranger and drifter he greets.
And shakes hands with every loner he meets
with a serious look on his face.
Love arrives safely with suitcase in tow.
Carrying with her the good things we know.
A reason to live and a reason to grow.
To trust. To hope. To care.
Hate sits alone on the hood of his car.
Without much regard to the moon or the stars.
Lazily killing the last of a jar
of the strongest stuff you can drink.
Love takes a taxi, a young man drives.
As soon as he sees her, hope fills his eyes.
But tears follow after, at the end of the ride,
cause he might never see her again.
Hate gets home lucky to still be alive.
He screams o'er the sidewalk and into the drive.
The clock in the kitchen says 2:55,
And the clock in the kitchen is slow.
Love has been waiting, patient and kind.
Just wanting a phone call or some kind of sign,
That the one that she cares for, who's out of his mind,
Will make it back safe to her arms.
Hate stumbles forward and leans in the door.
Weary head hung, eyes to the floor.
He says ""Love, I'm sorry"", and she says, ""What for?""
I'm your and that's it, Whatever.
I should not have been gone for so long.
I'm yours and that's it, forever.""
You're mine and that's it, forever.

Sister singin' 'Mazing Grace, she right in time
They’re laying poor papa low, in the ground that he worked and sowed
Now they waitin' at the Jackson Station for the train to roll
She’d been up all night, she got crows walking 'round her eyes
She can still raise a cup in a toast to a well ran dry
He left her on a Tuesday still, with gin, whiskey and a bottle of pills
Now she’s waitin’ at the Jackson Station looking over the hill
   Take me away hear that whistle play a sad sad song
   Lay me down where the river runs wide and strong
Sometimes she rides a ticket home 
Other times she'll leave you all alone
Just waiting at the Jackson Station for the train to roll
Well the four nineteen rolls on the red ball line
And the backwater shack's been wakin' to the four one nine
Said she’s got the smoke coming out of her stack
Dead running on a ten mile track
She’s waiting at the Jackson Station never coming back
She’s waiting at the Jackson Station never coming back
She’s waiting at the Jackson Station never coming back
Ain’t never coming back

He'd been up all night
Lying there in bed listening
To his newborn  baby cry
He makes a pot of coffee
He splashes water on his face

It gonna be OK
It won't be like this for long
One day we'll look back laugh'n
At the week we brought her home
This phase is gonna fly by

Stare right into my eyes
and sometimes
I think of you late at night
I dont no why
I wanna be somewhere where you are
I wanna be where
You're here
your eyes are looking into mine
so baby make me fly
my heart
has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes
I wake up
I'm alive
in only a little while
I'll cry
cause your my lullaby
so baby come hold me tight
cause I, I
I wanna be everything you need
I wanna be where
Your here
your eyes are looking into mine
so baby make me fly
my heart
has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes
Just as long as your mine
I'll be your everything tonight
Let me love you
kiss you
baby let me miss you
let me see your
dream about dream about
dream about your eyes
eyes,eyes
beautiful eyes
It’s strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything... is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you... feels wrong
You say that you’d take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes
You should’ve said no, you should’ve gone home
You should’ve thought twice before you let it all go
You should’ve know that word, bout what you did with her
Would get back to me...
And I should’ve been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn’t be asking myself why
You shouldn’t be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
You should’ve said no, baby and you might still have me
You can see that I’ve been crying
And baby you know all the right things... to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes
You should’ve said no, you should’ve gone home
You should’ve thought twice before you let it all go
You should’ve know that word, bout what you did with her
Would get back to me...
And I should’ve been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn’t be asking myself why
You shouldn’t be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
You should’ve said no, baby and you might still have me
I can’t resist… before you go, tell me this
Was it worth it…
Was she worth this…
Nooooo no... no, no,  no,  no...
You should’ve said no, you should’ve gone home
You should’ve thought twice before you let it all go
You should’ve know that word, bout what you did with her
Would get back to me...
And I should’ve been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn’t be asking myself why
You shouldn’t be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
You should’ve said no, baby and you might still have me
Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won’t see
That I want and I’m needing, everything that we should be
I'll bet she’s beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she’s got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me, I laugh cause it’s so damn funny
That I can’t even see, anyone when he’s with me
He says he’s so in love, he’s finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he’s all I think about at night
He’s the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He’s the song in the car I keep singing, don’t know why I do
Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can’t breathe?
And there he goes so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She’d better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she’s lucky cause
He’s the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He’s the song in the car I keep singing, don’t know why I do
So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light
I put his picture down, and maybe get some sleep tonight
Cause he’s the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
He’s the song in the car I keep singing, don’t know why I do
He’s the time, taken up, but there’s never enough
And he’s all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won’t see
 State the obvious, I didn’t get my perfect fantasy
 I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
 So go and tell your friends that I’m obsessive and crazy
 That’s fine; I’ll tell mine you’re gay
And by the way...
I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You’re a redneck, heartbreak
Who’s really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I’m concerned you’re
Just another picture to burn
 There’s no time for tears,
 I’m just sitting here planning my revenge
 There’s nothing stopping me
 From going out with all of your best friends
 And if you come around saying sorry to me
 My daddy’s gonna show you how sorry you’ll be
Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You’re a redneck, heartbreak
Who’s really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
In case you haven’t heard, you’re
Just another picture to burn
And if you’re missing me,
You’d better keep it to yourself
Cause coming back around here
Would be bad for your health...
Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You’re a redneck, heartbreak
Who’s really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that 
Stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You’re a redneck, heartbreak
Who’s really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I’m concerned you’re
Just another picture to burn
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You’re just another picture to burn
 Baby, burn...
 Friday night beneath the stars
 In a field behind your yard
 You and I are painting pictures in the sky
 And sometimes we don't say a thing
 Just listen to the crickets sing
 Everything I need is right here by my side
And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you
 Just a small town boy and girl
 Living in a crazy world
 Trying to figure out what is and isn't true
 And I don't try to hide my tears
 The secrets all my deepest fears
 Through it all nobody gets me like you do
And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you
 When I'm with anybody else
 It's so hard to be myself
 And only you can tell
That I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me
Who I wanna be
Well I'm only me when I'm with you
With you,     oh ho ho yeah 
 Wish I had concentrated
 They said love was complicated
 But it’s something I just fell into
 And it was overrated
 But just look what I created
 I came out alive but I’m black and blue
 Before you ask me if I’m alright
 Think about what I have to do, yeah
 Wake up and smell the breakup
 Fix my heart, put on my make-up
 Another mess I didn’t plan
 And I’ll bet you thought you beat me
 Wish you could only see
 I got an ""I heart question mark""
 Written on the back of my hand
 I’d be fine if you’d just walk by
 But you had to talk about why
 You were wrong and I was right
 But I can’t believe you made me
 Sit at home, cry like a baby
 Wait right by the phone every night
And now you ask about ""you and I""
There’s no ""you and I""
Remember what you put me through, I had to
 Wake up and smell the breakup
 Fix my heart, put on my make-up
 Another mess I didn’t plan
 And I’ll bet you thought you beat me
 Wish you could only see
 I got an ""I heart question mark""
 Written on the back of my hand
 And when you’re home all alone at night
 You’ll still wonder why you took everything I had, oh baby
 I haven’t thought about you and I, there’s no you and I
 And I know, someday you will
 Wake up and smell the breakup
 Realize that we won’t make up
 It didn’t go the way you planned
 And you’ll know you didn’t beat me
 When you look down and see
I got an ""I heart question mark""
Written on the back of my hand
Written on the back of my hand

Law was waiting for us at the end of the line.                     
Any minute now we knew we were going to have to decide.
Take a fat chance come out gunning.
Get out now and try to keep running down south.
Til she said hey hey cut the rope
No  way we’re gonna let them get us both
Don’t stop running til we reach that coast
Let your pretty momma go up in smoke
Coming out of the harbor it was simple and new
Clean as clear water we could see straight through.
But in that old dust bowl when the money got low
it was all we could do to keep a nail in the floor
Showed on her face, tell by the lines
These were desperate times
Pistol strapped and her hair was dyed
Gonna make her money like Bonnie and Clyde
Well be alright
And she said hey hey cut the rope
No  way were gonna let them get us both
Dont stop running til we reach that coast
Let your pretty momma go up in smoke
Dont let the sorry weather get you down
Change your last name, try your luck around
And if they ever come to ask about me
Tell them that you knew me and you kind of liked me
I ain’t afraid to go it on my own
You can make a run and make it all alone
Youll be all right
End of the line the engines still burning
Just like the wheels, the hands keep turning round and round
Til time ran out

She was laid out on that long white table
So cold, so pale, so fair
Let her go, let her go, God bless her
Where ever she may be
Let her search that whole wide world over
Never find a man as sweet as me
She'll never find a man as sweet as me
When I die, won't you bury me in my high top Stetson hat
Put a twenty dollar gold piece on my watch hand
So the gang'll know I died standing pat
I want six crapshooters for pallbearers
Pretty gals sing me a song
I want a jazz band on my hearse wagon
To raise Hell as we roll 'long
Won't you roll out that rubber tarmac
Won't you roll out that rubber tarmac

There's only twelve of them men coming back
Now that you heard my story
Have another shot of the booze

40,High Cost Of Living (ver 2),Jamey Johnson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jamey-johnson/high-cost-of-living-chords-1248585,"I was just a normal guy, life was just a nine to five
With bills and pressure piled up to the sky.
Looking for another way to fly.
And crazy was becoming my new norm.
I'd pass out on the bedroom floor
And sleep right through the calm before the storm.
My life was just an old routine,
Every day the same damn thing, I couldn't even tell I was alive.
I tell you, the high cost of living, 
Ain't nothin' like the cost of living high.
That Southern Baptist parking lot was where I'd go to smoke my pot.
Sit there in my pickup truck and pray and staring at that giant cross
Just reminded me that I was lost and it just never seemed to point the way.
 Lookin' just to score another deal.
With my back against that damn eight ball
I didn't have to think or talk or feel.
My life was just an old routine.
Every day the same damn thing, I couldn't even tell I was alive.
I tell you, the high cost of living, 
Ain't nothin' like the cost of living high.
My whole life went through my head laying in that motel bed
Watchin' as the cops kicked in the door.
But I traded that for cocaine and a whore.
Of all the things I had and threw away.
This prison is much colder than that
One that I was locked up in just yesterday.
My life is just an old routine.
Everyday's the same damn thing, hell I can't even tell if I'm alive.
I tell you, the high cost of living 
Ain't nothin' like the cost of living high.
Ain't nothin' like the cost of living high.

41,Back When,Tim McGraw,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tim-mcgraw/back-when-chords-156234,"  Don't you remember the fizz in a pepper
Peanuts in a bottle at ten two and four
A fried bologna sandwich with mayo and tomato
Sittin' round the table don't happen much anymore
We've gotten    too complicated It's all   way overrated
I like the   old and outdated way of life
  Back when a hoe was a hoe
Coke was a coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I'm down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when
  I love my records, black, shiny vinyl
Clicks and pops and white noise, man they sounded fine
I had my favorite stations, the ones that played them all
Country, soul and rock-and-roll, what happened to those times?
I'm readin'    street slang for dummies cause they put   pop in my country
I want,   more for my money, the way it was back then
Back when a hoe was a hoe
Coke was a coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I'm down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when
Give me a    flat top for strumming
I want the     whole world to be humming
ohh  Just keep it coming, the way it was back then
Back when a hoe was a hoe
Coke was a coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I'm down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when, I miss back when

Took you home set you on the counter
Oh, at least a time or two
Maybe she'd thought it through.
Yellow sunset slowly dipping down in the rear view
Oh, how she'd love to sit and watch you
I could have done that a whole lot more
If I hadn't been so stubborn, been so selfish
Thought about her more, thought about me less
Joked and made her laugh, held her when she cried
A little more that.. maybe I...
Wouldn't be driving like hell flying like crazy down the highway
Calling everyone we know stopping any place she might be
Going any place she might go beating on the dash
Screaming out her name at the windshield tears soaking up my face
If I had loved her this much all along, maybe maybe, yeaa maybe...
She wouldn't be gone.. she wouldn't be gone..

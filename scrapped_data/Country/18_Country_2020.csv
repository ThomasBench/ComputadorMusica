There goes the man, there goes the plan, there goes the truck
Woman down, down to one prayer
""God get me through it for the two asleep upstairs""
She can't breathe, but she ain't dyin'
And there ain't no time for cryin'
There's a phoenix down inside when
Her feet are to the fire
Who you gonna bet on when the sky is fallin'?
Been to hell and back, up against the wall, then
Gets knocked down but ain't afraid of crawlin'
Who's your money on, who's your money on?
She can make a mountain move
And do it in her high heeled shoes
If she ain't back up yet, just stick around
You can't keep a woman down
A woman down
A woman down don't stay down long
Can't come unglued, yeah, she's got too much goin' on
If she's out of land, she'll find a boat
Can't find a hand, she'll find some rope
All out of heart, she'll find some hope
Where you swear it can't be found
Who you gonna bet on when the sky is fallin'?
Been to hell and back, up against the wall, then
Gets knocked down but ain't afraid of crawlin'
Who's your money on, who's your money on?
She can make a mountain move
And do it in her high heeled shoes
If she ain't back up yet, just stick around

A woman down a woman down

It’ll light up your smile when it lights up your smoke
And then buy you a drink, it’ll burn in your throat
With lips soaked in kerosene, a kiss is a match
And it just takes one to make the whole goddamn thing catch
‘Cause love is a fire, out of control
The desperate desire, the higher it goes
And once it sparks that devil’s dance in your heart and soul
You know it can’t be contained,
No, it won’t be tamed
Love is a fire,
  Let’s go down in flames
We’ve both been burned, but we’re still gonna play
‘Cause fools never learn, nor do we beg
We’ll burn up this bed ‘til we burn down this house
We’ll end up ashes, but we can’t stop it now
  Love is a fire, out of control
The desperate desire, the higher it goes
And once it sparks that devil’s dance in your heart and soul
You know it can’t be contained, and it won’t be tamed
Love is a fire, so baby tonight, let’s go down in flames
Flames
Were already lit, so who needs a match?
Just kiss me like kerosene and let the whole damn thing catch
Love is a fire, yeah, love is a fire
And once it sparks that devil’s dance in your heart and soul
You know it can’t be contained, and it won’t be tamed
Love is a fire,
  Let’s go down in flames
Let’s go down in flames
Let’s go down in flames
Let’s go dow-own

People and places are the songs
There’ll be slow and there’ll be fast ones
Lookin’ forward, lookin’ back ones
On that tiny two-lane town that you call home

If your life is a record
I’ll be the sad song
Your “good love gone bad” song
The part of your heart that’s bittersweet
Couldn’t be your happy song
But at least we had a song
So I’ll be the sad song you sing
Some night, when it’s raining
Your movin’ on song’s fast asleep
You’ll pour a glass of something
And let your heart start running
To that summer at that bar on Division Street
That last verse, you’ll want to change it
Some night, when it’s rainin’
I’ll be the sad song
Your “good love gone bad” song
The part of your heart that’s bittersweet
Couldn’t be your happy song

Couldn’t be your happy song

I don't love you, baby
I don't love you, no

While they're gathering dust
And I got so much free time on my hands

'Cause they're not as good without someone to share them with
I don't love you, baby
I don't love you, no

Are you telling me now, in the middle of the set, it's through?
Or did I walk by and I never saw it? Maybe
Or I was reading my lines and I never heard my cue
Running to the top of the hill, then the hill starts over
You can bury yourself in the ground that you dug up
Now I was just contemplating, when do the tears dry up?
Far too easy to bait me, at least we shared the cup
Are you telling me now, in the middle of the shit, ""I need you""?
Or are you telling me now, in the middle of the shit, ""Fuck you""?
I'm the only one left on the sinking boat not believing
That you were calling from the water and screaming back, ""It's true""
Start looking around and seeing it's far too easy
You could lose a limb in a snare you set for yourself
Now don't you try to fool me, when you're dumb you don't fear as much
If it's gonna be that simple, I'd rather do it drunk
Stumbling 'round until you're queasy
You're losing your hair, but you've got friends
And if it's gonna be that simple
I've got a long way to go to never again
Are you telling me now, in the middle of the shit, ""I need you""?
Are you telling me now, in the middle of the shit, ""I need you""?
Are you telling me now, in the middle of the shit, ""I need you""?

It begs you to come as you are
‘Cause you are the moonlight, the sun, and the stars
Take it one at a time, you will find your way

Pass it on for the comfort and welfare of others

And forget all those nights I was burnt blind and broken
As the smoke finally clears only flowers remain

Can we be strangers

And I'd've skipped that party
Yeah I never would had gone
If I could have seen the future
I would've just stayed home
You'd be a name I didn't know
In some idle conversation
With a laugh I never loved
And lips I never tasted
And I don't wanna want you

Sunny, Sunday mornings yeah they wouldn't hurt so bad
Songs about New Orleans wouldn't make me so damn sad
You wouldn't be that number
I deleted seven times
That hammer in my chest when someone orders Crown and Sprite
I don't wanna want you
I don't wanna love you
I don't wanna hate you
Or even care enough to
We struck out as lovers
We struck out as friends
Is it too much to ask
Can we be strangers
You dont miss some place you've never been
Some face that you ain't ever met
No, you don't have to remember
What you ain't ever had to forget
I don't wanna want you
I don't wanna love you
I don't wanna hate you
Or even care enough to
We struck out as lovers
We struck out as friends
Is it too much to ask

Yeah ah

It didn't get there pretty, but it got me there that day
So I'm a little sad to see it roll away
 I know it's a bad car, I know that the windshield's cracked
When it isn't leaking oil, it's leaking gas
It always needs a jump, it always needs Freon
Yeah, there's death and taxes, and the check engine light blinkin' on
But it heard the first bad word that my firstborn ever said
Running late when I hit the brakes at a yellow turning red
There's still Kool-Aid on the console that reminds me of that day
So I'm a little sad to see it roll away, roll away
It knows more of my secrets, than I'll ever tell
So to keep from crying, as they tow it away
I tell myself

Was it something you did?
Was I in a great big hurry to play house
And you just wanted to stay a kid?
Did you cheat on me?
Did I check out on you?
Was it really anybody's fault at all
Or did it fall apart?
Like thing’s sometimes do
Who broke whose heart?
Who made who cry?
Who really cares 'bout the reasons why
We said goodbye, is anybody's guess
All I know is I loved you
So fuck the rest
Do we give up too soon?
Do we hang on too long?
Was it you were never good enough for my dad
And I could never live up to your mom?
Was it that fight in that restaurant?
Or that red light in the rain?
When I could’ve reached over and touched your hand
But that moment passed and the light just changed
Who broke whose heart?
Who made who cry?
Who really cares 'bout the reasons why
We said goodbye, is anybody's guess
All I know is I loved you
So fuck the rest
The hurt, the d-rest are just words and blurry details
Of a story that was magic, even though it ended tragic
It was beautiful
So who broke whose heart?
Who made who cry?
Who really cares 'bout the reasons why
We said goodbye, is anybody's guess
All I know is I loved you

 I won't be in that rear view, oh tomorrow
Where you're going when you get there
Let your wheels roll
Let your wheels roll
Let your heartbreak beat to the radio
This is where the past is the past
Where the meant-to-be's ain't meant to last
Where the ""maybe we could work it out"" turns into ""maybe we can't""
This is where the memories we missed are catching dust in a picture frame
Where the hopin' turns to knowin' that there ain't no going back
This is where the past is the past

I'll be working a lot
Boxing up all the used to be's
Forgetting things 'til it's all been forgot
Letting you go
Letting you go

Consider it a crown the holiest may wear
It ain’t easy raisin’ babies when they grow like ragged weeds
It’s a miracle she carried any shred of sani-ty
But she had her stories and forgot the glory of the multitude of saints
Her mother lived in her medicine and her absent vanity
Look upon your mother and the silver in her hair
Consider it a crown the holiest may wear
Behold the mark of wisdom, make it your daily prayer
To look upon your mother and the silver in her hair
On the western side of the highway, near the feet of Tennessee
A woman like a pistol and  half my family  tree
When the circle grew by more than two, the sawmill could not buy
Everything you need with four mouths to feed, why you’re  barely gettin’  by
Look upon your mother and the silver in her hair
Consider it a crown the holiest may wear
Behold the mark of wisdom, the sign of trouble fair
To look upon your mother and the silver in her hair
 Last night in my slumber came the  matriarchs I  miss, they said
Dear one be annointed with  aging’s lasting  kiss
They’re pulling out a token of the  life you fully  lived
This chord we share unbroken to  you we freely  give
Awoken in the morning, arisen from my bed,
I found upon my pillow a single shining thread (two, three four)
Look upon your mother and the silver in her hair
Consider it a crown the holiest may wear
Behold the mark of wisdom, make it your daily prayer
To look upon your mother and the silver in her hair
Her hair
In her hair          (riff)

And the mischief in her blue eyes seemed to shine
I recall her mama loved her, and I wish I could forget
The way that trailer smelled of burned out cigarettes
Or her daddy and his temper, and how his spirit seemed to fade
As time stripped every meager gift away
Saw you frownin’ from the pages of the hard times
And it ain’t the first time, will it be the last time?
In a red brick house across the way
Not far through Mr. Gifford’s pines

I never knew home could be anything but fine
I never touched the darkness, I never went astray
I was treasured every moment, every single day
One is given wings and one is gets more than she can bear

Sliding down the hill in the winter snow
Now you look at me, lines upon your face
That was years ago, now you take my place
And I don’t have a doubt you will be alright
‘Cause I know there’s a healer in the sky
When my candle burns out you will be alright
‘Cause I know there’s a healer in the sky
Healer in the sky
That book you gave me took me half a day
Bring another by when you’re on your way
Got my own ideas about the end of time
Still I am always yours and you’re always mine
And I don’t have a doubt you will be alright
‘Cause I know there’s a healer in the sky
When my candle burns out you will be alright
‘Cause I know there’s a healer in the sky
Healer in the sky
I loved my husband, I loved my neighbors
I loved my children, and I loved a savior
I’ll take my chances on the cancer
I’ll live my life and I’ve found the answer (pause for one two three)

Brown-eyed women and red grenadine,

Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down,
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on.
1920 when he stepped to the bar,
Drank to the dregs of the whiskey jar.
1930 when the wall caved in,
He paid his way selling red-eyed gin.

The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean.
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down,
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on.
Delilah Jones was the mother of twins,
Two times over and the rest were sins.
Raised eight boys, only I turned bad,
Didn't get the lickin's that the other ones had.
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine,
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean.
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down,
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on.
Tumble down shack in Big Foot county.
Snowed so hard that the roof caved in.
Delilah Jones went to meet her God,
And the old man never was the same again.
Daddy made whiskey and he made it well.
Cost two dollars and it burned like hell.
I cut hick'ry just to fire the still,
Drink down a bottle and be ready to kill.

To get you on some red dirt

And kiss you 'bout a thousand times

Funny how you seem to care
A little less the further you go

Water dripping off your skin

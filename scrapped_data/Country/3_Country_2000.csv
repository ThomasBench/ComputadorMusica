0,What Was I Thinkin,Dierks Bentley,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/dierks-bentley/what-was-i-thinkin-chords-348847,"Becky was the beauty from south Alabama,
Her daddy had a heart like a nine pound hammer,
I think he even did a little time in the slammer,
What was I thinkin'
She snuck out one night and met me by the front gate,
Her daddy came out a wavin' that twelve gauge,
we tore out of the drive, he peppered my tailgate,
What was I thinkin'
Oh I knew there'd be hell to pay,
But that crossed my mind a little too late,
Cause I was thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top,
Sittin' right there in the middle by me,
I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss,
Man I just gotta get,
Goin' where the night might lead,
I know what I was feelin' 
But, what was I thinkin'
By the county line, the cop's were nippin' on our heels
Pulled off the road, kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights, tore through a corn field
What was I thinkin'
Out the the other side, she was hollerin' ""faster""
Took a dirt road, had the radio blastin'
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancin'
What was I thinkin'
Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay
But, that crossed my mind a little too late
Cause I was thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top
Sittin' right there in the middle by me
I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss
Man I just gotta get
Goin' where the night might lead
I know what I was feelin'
When a mountain of a man with a 'Born To Kill' tattoo
Tried to cut in, I knocked out his front tooth
Ran outside, hood-slidin' like Bo Duke
What was I thinkin'
Finally got her home at half past too late,
Her daddy, in a lawn chair, sittin' on the driveway
Put it in park, and he started my way
What was I thinkin'
Oh... what was I thinkin'
What was I thinkin'
Cause I was thinkin' 'bout a little white tank top,
Sittin' right there in the middle by me,
I was thinkin' 'bout a long kiss,
Man I just gotta get,
Goin' where the night might lead,
I know what I was feelin' 
Yeah, I know what I was feelin'
But, what was I thinkin'

1,Fruits Of My Labor,Lucinda Williams,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lucinda-williams/fruits-of-my-labor-chords-1520677,"Baby, see how I been living
Velvet curtains on the windows to
Keep the bright and unforgiving
Light from shining through
Baby, I remember all the things we did
When we slept together and the blue behind your eyelids
Baby, sweet baby
Traced your scent through the gloom
'Til I found these purple flowers
I was spent, I was soon
Smelling you for hours
Lavender, lotus blossoms too
Water the dirt, flowers last for you
Baby, sweet baby
Tangerines and persimmons
And sugarcane
Grapes and honeydew melon
Enough fit for a queen
Lemon trees don't make a sound
'Til branches bend and fruit falls to the ground
Baby, sweet baby
Come to my world and witness
The way things have changed
'Cause I finally did it, baby
I got out of La Grange
Got in my Mercury and drove out west
Pedal to the metal and my luck to the test
Baby, sweet baby
I been tryin' to enjoy
All the fruits of my labor
I been cryin' for you boy 
But truth is my savior
Baby, sweet baby if it's all the same
Take the glory any day over the fame
Baby, sweet baby

I am an American aquarium drinker
I assassin down the avenue
I'm hiding out in the big city blinking
What was I thinking when I let go of you
Let's forget about the tongue-tied lightning
Let's undress just like cross-eyed strangers
This is not a joke so please stop smiling
What was I thinking when I said it didn't hurt
I want to glide through those brown eyes dreaming
Take me from the inside, baby hold on tight
You were so right when you said I've been drinking
What was I thinking when we said good night
I want to hold you in the Bible-black predawn
You're quite a quiet domino, bury me now
Take off your band-aid 'cause I don't believe in touchdowns
What was I thinking when we said hello
I always thought that if I held you tightly
You'd always love me like you did back then
Then I fell asleep in the city kept blinking
What was I thinking when I let you back in

I assassin down the avenue

She’s “I can’t find a thing to wear” now and then she’s moody
She’s a Saturn with a sunroof with her brown hair a blowin'
She’s a soft place to land and a good feeling knowing
She’s a warm conversation that I wouldn’t miss for nothing
She’s a fighter when she’s mad and a lover when she’s loving
She’s everything that I ever wanted and everything I need
When I talk about her I go on and on and on
Cause she is everything to me
She’s a Saturday out on the town Church girl on Sunday
A cross around her neck and a cuss word cause it’s Monday
She’s a bubble bath and candle's baby come and kiss me
She’s a one glass of wine and she’s feelin kinda tipsy
She’s the giver I wish I could be and the stealer of the covers
She’s the picture in my wallet an' my unborn children's mother
She’s the hand that I'm holdin when I’m on my knees and prayin
She’s the answer to my prayers she’s the song that I’m playin and
She’s everything that I ever wanted and everything I need
When I talk about her I go on and on and on
Cause she is everything to me
She’s the voice I love to hear someday when I’m 90
She's that wooden rocking chair I want rocking right beside me
Everyday that passes I only love her more

5,The Ballad Of Love And Hate (ver 2),The Avett Brothers,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-avett-brothers/the-ballad-of-love-and-hate-chords-991134,"Love writes a letter and sends it to hate.
My vacations ending. I'm coming home late.
The weather was fine and the ocean was great
and I can't wait to see you again.
Hate reads the letter and throws it away.
""No one here cares if you go or you stay.
I barely even noticed that you were a---way.
I'll see you or I won't, whatever.""
Love sings a song as she sails through the sky.
The water looks bluer through her pretty eyes.
And everyone knows it whenever she flies,
and also when she comes down.
Hate keeps his head up and walks through the street.
Every stranger and drifter he greets.
And shakes hands with every loner he  meets
with a serious look on his face.
Love arrives safely with suitcase in tow.
Carrying with her the good things we know.
A reason to live and a reason to  grow.
To trust. To hope. To care.
Hate sits alone on the hood of his car.
Without much regard to the moon or the stars.
Lazily killing the last of a   jar
of the strongest stuff you can drink.
Love takes a taxi, a young man drives.
As soon as he sees her, hope fills his eyes.
But tears follow after, at the end of the ride,
cause he might never see her again.
Hate gets home lucky to still be alive.
He screams o'er the sidewalk and into the drive.
The clock in the kitchen says two fifty  five,
And the clock in the kitchen is slow.
Love has been waiting, patient and kind.
Just wanting a phone call or some kind of sign,
That the one that she cares for, who's out of his mind,
Will make it back safe to her arms.
Hate stumbles forward and leans in the door.
Weary head hung, eyes to the floor.
He says ""Love, I'm sorry"", and she says, ""What for?
I'm yours and that's it, whatever.
I should not have been gone for so   long.
I'm yours and that's it, forever.""
You're mine and that's it, forever.

Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy
With the baby in the backseat
Fifty miles to go and she was running low, on faith and gasoline 
It'd been a long hard year 
She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention 
She was going way too fast
And before she knew it she was spinning
On a thin black sheet of glass
She saw both their lives flash before her eyes
She didn't even have time to cry
She was so scared, she threw her hands up in the air

Take it from my hands
Cause I can't do this on  my  own 
I'm letting go
So give me one more chance
Save me from this road I'm on

And the car came to a stop
She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat
Sleeping like a rock
And for the first time in a long time
She bowed her head to pray

 My heart is broken 'cause my spirit's not free
 Lord, take away these chains from me
Can't see when I go to work, can't see when I get off
 How do you expect a man not to get lost
Every year I just keep getting deeper in debt
If there's a happy day, Lord, I haven't seen one yet
 Take 'em away, take 'em away, Lord
 Take away these chains from me
 My heart is broken 'cause my spirit's not free
 Lord, take away these chains from me
Land that I love is the land that I'm workin'
But it's hard to love it all the time when your back is a-hurtin'
 Gettin' too old now to push this here plow
 Please let me lay down so I can look at the clouds
 Take 'em away, take 'em away, Lord
 Take away these chains from me
 My heart is broken 'cause my spirit's not free
 Lord, take away these chains from me
The land that I know is where two rivers collide
The Brazos, the Navaso and the big blue sky
Flood plains, freight trains, watermelon vines 
Of any place on God’s green earth, this is where I choose to die 
 Take 'em away, take 'em away, Lord
 Take away these chains from me
 My heart is broken 'cause my spirit's not free
 Lord, take away these chains from me

Said she needed to clear her mind.
He figured she'd gone back to Austin,
'Cause she talked about it all the time.
It was almost a year, before she called him up.
Three rings and an answering machine,
Is what she got:
If you're calling 'bout the car, I sold it.
If this is Tuesday night, I'm bowling.
If you've got something to sell, you're wastin' your time,
I'm not buyin'.
If it's anybody  else, wait for the tone,
You know what to do.
  And P.S., if this is Austin...
I still love you.
The telephone fell to the counter.
She'd heard, but she couldn't believe.
What kind of man would hang on that long,
What kind of love that must be.
She waited three days, and then she tried again.
She didn't know what she'd say,
But she heard three rings and then:
If it's Friday night, I'm at the ballgame,
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain.
I'm headed out to the lake, and I'll be gone all weekend long.
But I'll call you back when I get home
On Sunday afternoon.
  And P.S., if this is Austin...
I still love you.
Well, this time she left her number,
But not another word.
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evening,
  And this is what he heard:
If you're calling 'bout my heart,
  I should listen to it a little more.
  Then it wouldn't have taken me so long
To know, where I  belong.
And by the way boy,   this is no machine you're talkin' to.
  Can't you tell that this is Austin...
And I still love you.
I still love you....

I finally made the warden my friend

taking care of Ol' Red

Got a nose that can smell a two day trail
He's a four legged tracking machine
You can consider yourself mighty lucky to get past
The gators and the quicksand beds
But all these years that I've been here
Ain't nobody got past Red

Ol' Reds itchin' to have a little fun
Red'll have you treed 'fore the mornin' comes
Well I paid off the guard and I slipped out a letter
To my cousin up in Tennessee
Oh and he brought down a blue tick hound
She was pretty as she could be
Well they penned her up in the swampland
'Bought a mile just south of the gate
and I'd take Ol' Red for his evening run
I'd just drop him off and wait
And the warden sang
Ol' Reds itchin' to have a little fun
Red'll have you treed 'fore the mornin' comes
Now Ol' Red got used to seeing
His lady every night
And so I kept him away for three or four days
And waited till the time got right
Well i made my run with the evenin' sun
And i smiled when i heard 'em let Red out
'Cause I was headed north to Tennessee
And Ol' Red was headed south
And the warden sang
Ol' Reds itchin' to have a little fun

 Try and stay out of everybodys way
 It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
 For the next four years in this town
 Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
 You know I haven't seen you around, before

 You're gonna believe them

 And he's got a car and you're feeling like flying
 And you're momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
 And you're dancing round your room when the night ends
 When the night ends
 'Cause when you're fifteen and 
 Somebody tells you they love you
 You're gonna believe them
 And when you're fifteen
 And your first kiss makes your head spin 'round
 But in your life you'll do things greater than
 Dating the boy on the football team
 But I didnt know it at fifteen
 When all you wanted was to be wanted
 Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
 Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
 But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
 And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy 
 Who changed his mind and we both cried
 'Cause when you're fifteen and 
 Somebody tells you they love you
 You're gonna believe them

 I've found time can heal most anything
 And you just might find who you're supposed to be

Sweet tea, pecan pie, and homemade wine where the peaches grow
And my house it's not much to talk about
But it's filled with love that's grown in southern ground

See the love in my woman's eyes
Feel the touch of a precious child
And know a mother's love

Not where you live, what you drive, or the price tag on your clothes
There's no dollar sign on a peace of mind

Raise you glasses for a toast

Well, this lunch break is gonna take all afternoon, and half the night
Tomorrow mornin' I know there'll be hell to pay, hey but that's alright
Ain't had a day off now in over a year, my Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here
If the phone's for me, you can tell them I've just sailed away
Pour me something tall and strong, make it a Hurricane before I go insane
It's only half past twelve, but I don't care, it's 5 o'clock, somewhere
I could pay off my tab, pour myself in cab and be back to work before two

And her blue tick hound dog Gideon
Sittin' on the front porch' coolin' in the shade
Singin' every song that the radio played
Waitin' for the Alabama sun to go down
Two red dirt girls in a red dirt town
Me and Lillian
Just across the line and a little southeast of Meridian
She loved her brother I remember back when
He was fixin' up a '49 Indian
He told her ""Little sister, gonna ride the wind
Up around the moon and back again""
He never got farther than Vietnam
I was standin' there with her when the telegram come
For Lillian
Now he's lyin' somewhere about a million miles from Meridian
She said ""There's not much hope for a red dirt girl
Somewhere out there is a great big world,
that's where I'm bound
And the stars might fall on Alabama, but one of these days
I'm gonna swing my hammer down
Away from this red dirt town
I'm gonna make a joyful sound""
She grew up tall and she grew up thin
Buried that old dog Gideon
By a crepe myrtle bush at the back of the yard
Her daddy turned mean and her mama leaned hard
Got in trouble with a boy from town
Figured that she might as well settle down
So she dug right in
Across a red dirt line just a little southeast of Meridian
She tried hard to love him but it never did take
It was just another way for a heart to break
So she learned to bend
But one thing they don't tell you 'bout the blues when you got 'em
You keep on fallin' 'cause there ain't no bottom
There ain't no end, at least not for Lillian
Nobody knows when she started her skid
She was only 27 and she had 5 kids
Coulda' been the whiskey, coulda been the pills
Coulda been the dream she was tryin' to kill
But there won't be a mention in the news of the world
About the life and the death of a red dirt girl named Lillian
Who never got any farther across the line than Meridian
Now the stars still fall on Alabama
The night she finally laid that hammer down
Without a sound, in the red dirt ground

He's left me no warning, no words of farewell
Oh, he taught me to love him and called me his flower
That was blooming to cheer him through life's dreary hour
Oh, I long to see him and regret the dark hour
He's gone and neglected his pale wildwood flower.

Pirates sail and lost boys fly
Fish bite moonbeams every night
And I love you
Godspeed little man
Sweet Dreams little man
Oh, my love will fly to you each night on angel's wings
Godspeed (Sweet Dreams)
The rocket racer's all tuckered out
Superman's in pyjamas on the couch
Goodnight moon we'll find the mouse
And I love you
Godspeed little man
Sweet Dreams little man
Oh, my love will fly to you each night on angel's wings
Godspeed (Sweet Dreams)
God bless Mommy and matchbox cars
God bless Dad and thanks for the stars
God hears ""amen"" wherever we are
And I love you

49,As Good As I Once Was,Toby Keith,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/toby-keith/as-good-as-i-once-was-chords-200215,"She said, ""I seen you in here before.""
I said, ""I been here a time or two.""
She said,""Hello my name is Bobby Jo,
meet my twin sister Betty Lou.
And we're both feelin' kinda wild tonight,
you're the only cowboy in this place.
And if you're up for a rodeo,
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face.""
I ain't as good as I once was
I got a few years on me now
But there was a time, back in my prime
When I could really lay it down
If you need some love tonight
Then, I might have just enough
I ain't as good as I once was,
But I'm as good, once, as I ever was
I still hang out with my best friend. Dave
I've known him since we were kids at school
Last night he had a few shots,
Got in a tight spot
Hustlin' a game of pool
With a couple of redneck boys
One great big fat biker man
I David yell across the room
""Hey buddy, how 'bout a helpin' hand?""
I ain't as good as I once was
My, how the years have flown
But there was a time, back in my prime
When I could really hold my own
If you want to fight tonight
Guess those boys don't look all that tough
I ain't as good as I once was,
But I'm as good, once, as I ever was
I used to be hell on wheels
Back when I was a younger man
Now, my body say's, ""You can't do this, boy.""
But my pride say's ""Oh, yes you can.""
I ain't as good as I once was
Thats just the cold hard truth
I still throw a few back, talk a little smack
When I'm feelin' bullet proof
So don't double-dog dare me, now
'Cause I'd have to call your bluff
I ain't as good as I once was,
But I'm as good, once, as I ever was
May not be good as I once was
But I'm as good, once, as I ever was

I've been gone so many years, I didn't realize you had a phone
I saw your cattle coming in, boy they're looking mighty fat and slick
I saw Fred at the service station, told me that his wife is awful sick
You heard my record on the radio, oh, well it's just another song
But I've got a hit recorded and it'll be out on the market 'fore too long
I got this ring in Mexico, no, it didn't cost me quite a bunch
When you're in the business that I'm in, the people call it puttin' up a front
I know I've lost a little weight, I guess I am looking kind of pale
If you didn't know me better, Dad, you'd think that I'd just gotten out of jail
No, we don't ever call them beer joints, night clubs are the places that I work
You meet a lot of people there, but no, there ain't much chance of gettin' hurt
I'm sorry that I couldn't be there with you all when Momma passed away
I was on the road and when they came and told me it was just too late
I drove by the grave to see her, boy, that really is a pretty stone
I'm glad that Fred and Jan are here, it's better than you being here alone
Well I knew you's gonna ask me who the lady is that's sleeping in the car
That's just a girl who works for me and, man, she plays a pretty mean guitar
We worked in San Antone last night, she didn't even have the time to dress
She drove me down from Nashville and to tell the truth I guess she needs the rest
Well, Dad, I gotta go, we got a dance to work in Cartersville tonight
Let me take your number down, I'll call you, and I promise you I'll write
Now you be good and don't be chasin' all those pretty women that you know
And by the way if you see Barbara Walker tell her that I said ""Hello.""

Spied a beggar man with rags upon his feet
Took a penny from my pocket
In his tin cup I did drop it
I heard him say as I made my retreat
May the bird of paradise fly up your nose
May an elephant caress you with his toes
May your wife be plagued with runners in her hose
May the bird of paradise fly up your nose
The laundry man is really on his toes
Found a hundred dollar bill among my clothes
When he called me I came running
Gave him back his dime for phoning
I heard him saying as I turned to go
May the bird of paradise fly up your nose
May an elephant caress you with his toes
May your wife be plagued with runners in her hose
May the bird of paradise fly up your nose
I was way behind one day to catch the train
The Taxi driver said We'll make it just the same
The speed cop made it with us
And as he wrote out the ticket
I stood by politely waiting for my change
May the bird of paradise fly up your nose
May an elephant caress you with his toes
May your wife be plagued with runners in her hose
May the bird of paradise fly up your nose
May the bird of paradise fly up your nose

Behind the dash in Mary's crumpled up machine
A little match box circled by a rubber band
And inside the ring from Walter Browning's hand
It took awhile to figure out just what it meant

And took a sacred oath that I would never tell
The truth about the Carroll County accident

But my daddy became a mighty big man
With a simple philosophy
Do what you do, do well boy
Do what you do, do well
Give your love and all o' your heart
And do what you do, do well
Now sometimes he'd kiss my mama
And hold her so tenderly
Then he'd look across the top of her head
Then he'd wink and say to me
Do what you do, do well boy
Do what you do, do well
Give your love and all o' your heart
And do what you do, do well, well
Now he was a man of laughter
But if a tragedy came by
The tears ran free, then he'd say to me
Never be afraid to cry
Do what you do, do well boy
Do what you do, do well
Give your love and all o' your heart
And do what you do, do well
Today I still remember
Just like it was yesterday
About a mighty big man with a mighty big heart
And a mighty few words to say
Do what you do, do well boy
Do what you do, do well
Give your love and all o' your heart
And do what you do, do well
Do what you do, do well
Do what you do, do well

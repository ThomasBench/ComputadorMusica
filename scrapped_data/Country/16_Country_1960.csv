I keep my eyes wide open all the time.
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds.
Because you're mine, I walk the line.
I find it very, very easy to be true.
I find myself alone when each day's through.
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you.
Because you're mine, I walk the line.
As sure as night is dark and day is light.
I keep you on my mind both day and night.
The happiness I've known proves that it's right.
Because you're mine, I walk the line.
You've got a way to keep me on your side.
You give me cause for love that I can't hide.
For you I'd even try to turn the tide.
Because you're mine, I walk the line.
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine.
I keep my eyes wide open all the time.

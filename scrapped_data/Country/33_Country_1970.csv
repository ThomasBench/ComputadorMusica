0,If Were Not Back In Love By Monday (ver 2),Merle Haggard,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/merle-haggard/if-were-not-back-in-love-by-monday-chords-1186183,"We can call Mrs. Johnson to keep the kids a day or two.
Take the early flight to Florida, just the way we used to do.
Have room service bring us breakfast, make love all through the day.
If We're Not Back In Love By Monday, we can go our sep'rate ways.
If We're Not Back In Love By Monday we can't say we didn't try.
Just before we bury our love, Let's make sure we've let die.
Sleep a few more nights together, say the things we used to say
If We're Not Back In Love By Monday, we can go our sep'rate ways.
We could find that little cafe with funny sounding name.
Get the table by the window, I'll say I love you once again.
If the vi'lin player's still there, we'll dance until the break of day.
If We're Not Back In Love By Monday, we can go our sep'rate ways.
If We're Not Back In Love By Monday we can't say we didn't try.
Just before we bury our love, Let's make sure we've let die.
Sleep a few more nights together, say the things we used to say
If We're Not Back In Love By Monday, we can go our sep'rate ways.

Lord, It makes me want to cry
It reminds me of my Daddy
And that Texas Lullaby
See those cactus flowers blooming'
Like the twinkle in his eye
Everytime he started singin'
That old Texas Lullaby
Yippie Yi Little doggie, roll on, roll on
Yippie Yi Little doggie, take me home, take me home
It's so cold on the desert, I'm chilled to the bone
Yippie yi Little doggie, yippie yi
Looky yonder there's a dust cloud painting pictures in the sky
Daddy told me all about, in that Texas Lullaby
Them old Longhorns are a ballin', Lord I know I must be high
Wish my Daddy could hear me singin' this old Texas Lullaby
Yippie Yi Little doggie, roll on, roll on
Yippie Yi Little doggie, take me home, take me home
It's so cold on the desert, I'm chilled to the bone
Yippie yi Little doggie, yippie yi
Daddy Left me this old guitar, though I never quite knew why
He said someday I'd be famous like the Texas Lullaby
But it's been a month of Sundays since I've seen that old eagle fly
And nobody wants to listen to a Texas Lullaby
Yippie Yi Little doggie, roll on, roll on
Yippie Yi Little doggie, take me home, take me home
It's so cold on the desert, I'm chilled to the bone
Yippie yi Little doggie, yippie yi

Ran through Tennessee just like that old moonshine
Old Joe Clark Cripple Creek Annie Get Your Gun
I guess my ol' time favorite was that Fox On The Run
Like a fox (like a fox) like a fox (like a fox) on the run
Grandpa played the dobro till the break of dawn

Carol played the washboard and the tambourine

And you're the rich man that can buy her all the world

You give her charge to count some cheque books
Thinking that's the way to keep her satisfied    
But what she needs the most is what no charge or count of checkbook ever buy
The lady is a woman even you should understand
While the lady may need soft things the woman needs a man
Yes the lady is a woman that you can be certain of
While your lady wants for nothing still your woman wants for love
Well all I do is drive your limousine and chauffer you the way you'd like to go
But when I look at your lady even I can see there's something you don't know
You give her everything she wanted but not one of the things she really need
Yes you still may have your lady but lately now your woman comes to me

I've unlocked doors, I've broken chains
Fading like a shadow in the dawn
When other loves have turned to clay
I've turned my back and walked away

From the sweet love I've been knowin'
To the restless ways and days that I once knew

Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags  someone gave us
And how my mamma put those rags to use
There were rags of many Colors and every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Mamma sewed the rags together  she sewied ever piece with love
She made my coat of many Colors  I was so proud of
As she sewed she told the story from the bible she had read
About a coat of many Colors Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you good love and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it
As mamma blessed it with a kiss
My  coat of many Colors that my mamma made for me
Made from  only rags  but I wore it so proudly
though we didn't have much money oh I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many Colors my mamma made for me
So with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many Colors  well I started off to school
Just to find the children laughing and makin' fun of me
In my coat of many Colors my mamma made for me
Now  I didn't understand it for I felt that I was rich
And I told them of the love my mamma sewed in ever stitch
All about the story mamma told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many Colors
WAs worth more than all of their gold
They didn't under stand it and I tried to make them see
One's only poor only if you choose to be
We didnt  have no money but I'm as rich as I could be
In my coat of many Colors my mamma made for me
In my coat of many Colors my mamma made just for me

Where can you take me to make me understand
The wind can shake me, brothers forsake me.
The rain can touch me, but can I touch the rain

I saw the milkman, I saw the businessman, I saw the only road in sight.
And then I got to thinkin', what makes you want to go   to know the 
wherefore and the why
So many times now, O Lord, I can't remember, if it is September or July
Come on, sunshine, what can you show me
Where can you take me to make me understand
The wind can shake me, brothers forsake me.
The rain can touch me, but can I touch the rain
And all at once it came to me. I saw the wherefore,
And you can see it if you try.
It's in the sun above, it's in the ones you love.

Why you never see bright colors on my back, and
Why does my ap -  pearance, seem to have a sombre tone,
Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on.
I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down,
Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town.
I wear it for the prisoner, who has long paid for his crime.
But is there because he's a victim of the crime.
I wear the black for those, who've never read,
Or listened to the words, that Jesus said,
About the road to happi - ness, through love and chari - ty,
Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me.
Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do sup - pose,
In our streak-of-lightnin' cars and fancy clothes,
But just so we're re -minded, of, the ones who are held back,
Up front there oughta be a man in black.           
I wear it for the sick and lonely old,
For the reckless ones, whose bad trip left them cold,
I wear the black in mournin', for the lives that could have been,
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men. 
And I wear it for the thousands who have died,
believen' that the Lord was on their side,
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died,
Believen' that we all were on their side. 
Well, there's things that never will be right I know,
and things need changing everywhere you go,
but 'til we start to make a move, to make a few things right,
you'll never see me wear a suit of white.
Oh I'd love to wear a rainbow every day,
and tell the world that everything's OK,
but I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back,
'till things are brighter, I'm the man in black.

Well he hid out in the bush and in the forest

Lest the ravens utter in despair
For they cannot caress her flower
Nor in the hour, find hands of care
So 'round the maypole drift their wings
They cannot drink her beauty springs
Truth is but a woman with eyes of black
While seen through her tears, can see no fears
Lest they be seen from the other side
And I cannot behold her smile
But in my trial hope to abide
So 'round the maypole hover near
In someway her lover here
And truth is but a woman, yeah, yeah
Truth is but a woman, adorned in white
A child in waiting like a mystic bride
Without a husband standing by her side
And she cannot withhold her love

Oh, truth is but a woman

48,Dont You Think Its Time,Don Williams,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/don-williams/dont-you-think-its-time-chords-3727163,"Don't you think it's time  for us to work it out
Don't you think you know  what it's all about
Don't you think it's sad  living all alone
So don't you think it's time  for us to get along
We know the songs  of all the wrongs
Love that died  nobody tried
But here and now  I know what's true
I can't live  without you
So don't you think it's time  for us to work it out
Don't you think you know  what it's all about
Don't you think it's sad  living all alone
So don't you think it's time  for us to get along
Find the page  that says we're old
Is love at home  or is it cold
So don't you think it's time  for us to work it out
Don't you think you know  what it's all about
Don't you think it's sad  living all alone
So don't you think it's time  for us to get along

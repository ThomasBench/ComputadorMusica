Walking in the sand hand in hand never thinking that it could end
Making our love with the moon above at the drive-in picture show
And it was burgers and fries and cherry pies in a world we used to know
Changes come and go  we've had our share I know
Now it seems we don't have time for love anymore
All the things we used to say little things we did each day
Oh I long to do the things that we did before   when it was
Burgers and fries and cherry pies it was simple and good back then
Walking in the sand hand in hand never thinking that it could end
Making our love with the moon above at the drive-in picture show
And it was burgers and fries and cherry pies in a world we used to know
Well I'm still the same old me that's all I'll ever be
I'd like to think that you're the same old you
We lost something down the line that I wish we both could find
Lord I'd like to do the things that we used to do   when it was

1,An Old Greyhound,Hoyt Axton,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/hoyt-axton/an-old-greyhound-chords-1865551,"An old grey-hound named the ""Honey-suckle Rose""
She's the only woman I really love.
She's a four speed lady and she rolls real easy
there's tequila in the driver she loves. 
And we ride all night in the pale moon light
singing to the stars above.
And the smokey 'round the curve, well he ain't got the nerve
to mess with the woman I love.
She's got a Detroit diesel, and an air cushion ride,
and she smokes at the top of the hill.
She's got an over-sized load, and a two-lane road,
and she don't have time to kill.
Northbound, southbound, eastbound, west.
Racing trucks and doin' our best.
Four-lane freeways we love best.
The highway is our home.
Well, I think I better find me a good truck stop,
got a cup of coffee on my mind.
Got a travelin' band doing one night stands,
and they love it when the gears don't grind.
And the way we love, is the way we live.
And the way we sing, is the way we give.
Don't give a damn who you think we am,
we're being who we are.
There's a wreck on the road, on the nine mile grade,
but the Honey-suckle Rose don't mind.
'Cause she knows that I love her, and I never would let her go
Flying down the highway blind.
Just the Rose and me and my old CB
with the handle of the Golden Bear.
From the shaky city to the Tennessee line,
10-4's gonna get us there.
And the way we love is the way we live
And the way we sing is the way we give.
Don't give a damn who you think we am,
We're being who we are.
And we ride all night in the pale moon light
singing to the stars above.
And the smokey 'round the curve, well he ain't got the nerve,
to mess with the woman I love,
Don't mess with the woman I love.
Don't mess with the woman I love.

 Over promises that I made
But for the first time in my life I know now
How it feels  to be afraid
I don't know what I'd do if you go away
This will sure be one lonely ol' town
 For a man's so busy going up in the world
That he couldn't see love coming down
Love coming down
 I remember all the times you told me
Love's all that mattered to you
And looking back now, wondering how I believed
I had things more important to do
I can see how I must have looked to you
Like some fool on a merry-go-round
Another man's so busy going up in the world
I just couldn't see love comin' down (oo' ooh)
Love comin' down
Can't you see how everything I've learned
Would just be wasted if you leave me?
If you'll just give it one more try
I swear I'll always be here when you need me
If you can find it in your heart to forgive me
I'll try to keep both my feet on the ground
 Forgive a man so busy going up in the world
That he couldn't see love comin' down
Love comin' down

Don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
Make 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
They'll never stay home and they're always alone
Even with someone they love
A cowboy ain't easy to love and he's harder to hold
He'd rather give you a song than silver or gold
Budwiser buckles and soft faded Wrangler's
And each night begins a new day
If you can't understand him and he don't die young
He'll probably just ride away
Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
Don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
Make 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
They'll never stay home and they're always alone
Even with someone they love
A cowboy like smoky old pool rooms and clear mountain mornings
Little warm puppies and children and girls of the night
Them that don't know him won't like him and them that do
Sometimes won't know how to take him
He ain't wrong, he's just different and his pride won't let him
Do things to make you think he's right

Don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
Make 'em be doctors and lawyers and such

He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above,   on the wings of a dove
When troubles surround us, when evils come
The body grows weak, the spirit grows numb
When these things beset us, He doesn't forget us
He sends down His love,    on the wings of a dove
On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above,   on the wings of a dove
When Noah had drifted on the flood many days
He searched for land, in various ways
Troubles, he had some, But wasn't forgotten
He sent him His love,   on the wings of a dove
On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends His pure sweet love
A sign from above,   on the wings of a dove
When Jesus went down to the river that day
He was baptized, in the usual way
And when it was done, God blessed his son
He sent him his love,   on the wings of dove
On the wings of a snow white dove
He sends His pure sweet love

Now I got no more money to spend,

When I left she said come back again,
I watched them lonesome boxcar wheels,
Turnin' down the tracks out of town,
And it's on that lonesome railroad track,
I'm gonna lay my burden down.
I was raised on a farm the first years of my life,
Life was pretty good they say,
I'll probably live to be some ripe old age,
If death'll stay out of my way,
This world can take my money and time,
But it sure can't take my soul,
I'm goin' down to the railroad tracks,
Watch them lonesome boxcars roll.
There's some big ol' Buicks at the Baptist church,
Cadillacs at the Church of Christ,
I parked my camel by an old haystack,
I'll be lookin for that needle all night,
There ain't gonna be no radial tires,
Turnin' down the streets of gold,
I'm going down to the railroad tracks,
And watch them lonesome boxcars roll.
Now if you ever heard the whistle on a fast freight train,
Beatin' out a beautiful tune,
If you ever seen the cold blue railroad tracks,
Shinin' by the light of the moon,
If you ever felt the locomotive shake the ground,
I know you don't have to be told,
Why I'm goin down to the railroad tracks,
And watch them lonesome boxcars roll,
Yeah, I'm going down to the railroad tracks,
Watch them lonesome boxcars roll.

Like I do when that moon's gettin' full
Is there a change in the air or the way that I care
How can I explain how I feel
Wish I knew me better
And I would if I half-tried
But my will is strong and it just carries me on
Following the way that I feel
No my love ain't dead it just got to my head
And I need a little space to feel free
Lately, I've gone a lot of places
And seen a lot of things I didn't need to see
Maybe I followed a star a little bit too far
And lost something along the way
Or maybe I needed to lose
Something I shouldn't have had
But it feels so good to take a second look
Following the way that I feel
No my love ain't dead it just got to my head
And I need a little space to feel free
I feel loose and contented
Like to go where I want, when I can
If I set too much, my thoughts begin to rush
And nothin' is clear that I hear
I guess I'm a mover
Just travelin' through my life to somewhere
But it feels so good to take a second look
Following the way that I feel
No my love ain't dead it just got to my head
And I need a little space to feel free
While following the way that I feel
While I'm following
Following the way that I feel
While I'm following

Momma's got the fever and the baby’s sick too

Ain’t a blood hound in Georgia that can follow his track
We bought a new mule brought him up from down south

Water in the well is barely out of sight
Can’t take a bath on a Saturday night

And this is what the letter said""

Slowly, so slowly, he walked outside

And how his drinking had ruined their lives

And a vision filled his poor, poor heart with dread
For you see, folks, it was him lying drunk there in the gutter, clutching in his hand

Hungry for laughter and here ever after

I saw the look in his eyes

But he started shaking his big heart was breaking
As he turned to the woman and said.

Swore I would drown all the sorrow in me

Until I had no place left to go
Made all the missions by mornin' and then I made the dives every night
Until I made a wreck of my body and my soul
And then I met this lady
In time she made me forget, her love set me free

Voices sound sad as they're singing along
Another piece of America's lost
He rides a feed lot and clerks in a market
On weekends selling tobacco and beer
His dreams of tomorrow surrounded by fences
But he'll dream tonight of when fences weren't here
He blazed the trail with Lewis and Clark
And eyeball to eyeball Ol' Wyatt backed down
He stood shoulder to shoulder with Travis in Texas
And rode with the Seventh when Custer went down
This is the last cowboy song
The end of a hundred year waltz
Voices sound sad as they're singing along
Another piece of America's lost
Remington showed us how he looked on canvas
And Louis L'Amour has told us his tale
And Willie and Waylon and me sing about him
And wish to God we could have ridden his trail
  The Old Chisholm Trail is covered in concrete now
And they truck 'em to market in fifty foot rigs
  They just blow by his market never slowing to reason
Like living and dying was all he did

But I didn't get no one to answer
So I opened up the window and I smoked a little bit
And I watched the cars go by
I'm gonna hunt you up and ask you
If you found out anything new
Or are you a-hangin to the best you had

And believe you me that's true
Just a-lookin at the water ways churning with the steamboat whistle blues

It looks like an electric shaver now
Where the courthouse used to be
The grass is all synthetic
And we don't know for sure about the food

About the only thing I trust these days
Is them steamboat whistle blues

As he stretched out back on the water bed
Bluegrass music is a thing of the past
And the same for rock and roll
And I loaned him two or three dollars
And he gave me the latest news
And he left me here with a Rolling Stone
And the steamboat whistle blues
I'll tear off down the river some day before I'm through
Then come back here and see it out

You favor a girl I once knew
I imagine that she’s in Tennessee
Oh Lord I should be there too.
The same way that I’m leaving you
For love is mainly just memories
And everyone’s got them but few.
It’s a brand new Tennessee waltz
You’re literally just waltzing on air
It’s a brand new Tennessee waltz
With no telling who will be there
Descending victorian stairs
I’m feeling like one of your photographs
With not even you left to care.
A tune for a Tennessee kid
Who’s feeling like leaving another town
With no place to go if he did.
It’s a brand new Tennessee waltz
You’re literally just waltzing on air
It’s a brand new Tennessee waltz
With no telling who will be there

Well, This is Death none can excel

You've blinded my eyes so I can't see
Well, you're hurtin' my body, you make me cold

out on the sea, there is a place
out on the sea there's a wave
with the power to save
all the sailors from the dark and the deep
we used to dance in the shadows
under the moon's pale light
away from home and all a-lone
turning a-way into the night
and she would shine like a diamond
trapped in a clear crystal ring
and the tears in my eyes
were the stars in the sky
fading a-way when she would sing
out on the sea, there is an island
out on the sea, there is a place
out on the sea there's a wave
with the power to save
all the sailors from the dark and the deep

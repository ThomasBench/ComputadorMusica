0,4Th Of July (ver 3),Shooter Jennings,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/shooter-jennings/4th-of-july-chords-544132,"Alone with the morning burning red in the canvas in my head
Painting a picture of you
And me driving across country, in a dusty old RV
Just the road and its majesty
And I'm looking at you with the world in the rear view
You were pretty as can be, sitting in the front seat
Looking at me, telling me you love me, and your happy to be,
With me on the 4th of July
We sang Stranglehold to the stereo
Couldn't take no more of that rock n roll
So we put on a little George Jones and just sang along
Those white lines get drawn into the sun if you aint got no one
To keep you hanging on
And there you were like a queen with your nightgown,
Riding shotgun from town to town
Staking a claim on the world we found
And I'm singing to you, your singing to me ,you were out of the blue to a
You were pretty as can be, sitting in the front seat
Looking at me, telling me you love me, and your happy to be,
With me on the 4th of July
We sang Stranglehold to the stereo
Couldn't take no more of that rock n roll
So we put on a little George Jones and just sang along
and im looking for you in the silence that we share
Looking at me, telling me you love me, and your happy to be,
With me on the 4th of July
We sang Stranglehold to the stereo
Couldn't take no more of that rock n roll
So we put on a little George Jones and just sang along
Sang along....

Sunset at the shoreline, we are laughing, breaking up, just like the waves
Are you feeling, feeling, feeling like I'm, feeling like 
I'm floating, floating, up above that big blue ocean
Sand beneath our feet, big blue sky above our heads, no need to keep
Stressing from our everyday life, on our minds,
We have got to leave all that behind
Well, I have got a sister, and she has got a baby, with brand new eyes
And her daddy is an engineer, and they just took her to the sea for, the first time
Now they're under, under, underneath a big umbrella
Summer, summer, summer time to help us forget, nine to fives
We have got to leave all that behind
I have, worries, to give to the sea
We can, walk dear, the pier is farther than it seems
Midnight at the shoreline, fireworks above us, a screaming bloom
They're sent by some teenager, and kid whoever you are, I am thanking you
Now we're dancing, dancing, dancing with no music
What is happening, happening, happening and no feelings
Except this is right
We just had to leave all that behind

I like my shirt untucked
I spend Saturdays working on my truck
I don't like to fight
But I ain't scared to bleed
Most don't mess with a guy like me
Cause guys like me drink too many beers 
On Friday after work
Our best blue jeans have Skoal rings
We wear our boots to church
So rough around the edges
It's hard to believe 
That girls like you
Love guys like me
Your daddy worked at the bank
Mine worked on cars
You went to college
I pulled graveyard
You must have had your pick
Of all the trust fund types
But you came back to me and only God knows why

Our best blue jeans have Skoal rings
We wear our boots to church
So rough around the edges
It's hard to believe 
That girls like you
Love guys like me
Now there's a lot of guys like me out there
In a lot of little towns
And telling' all our buddies 
We won't ever settle down
We say that’s just the way we are 
And the way we'll always be

You say you need a change
Don't all the dreams we've seen come true mean anything
You say it's different now 
And you keep staring at the door
How can you walk away      don't I matter anymore
If being free's worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time
If we had known
Our love would come to this
We could have saved our hearts the hurt of wasted years
Well it's been fun
What else can I say
If the feeling's gone words won't stop you anyway
If being free's worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time
Goodbye, baby

4,The Lighthouses Tale,Nickel Creek,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/nickel-creek/the-lighthouses-tale-chords-1758695,"I am a lighthouse, worn by the weather and the waves. 
I keep my lamp lit, to warn the sailors on their way. 
I'll tell a story, paint you a picture from my past. 
I was so happy, but joy in this life seldom lasts. 
I had a keeper, he helped me warn the ships at sea. 
We had grown closer, 'till his joy meant everything to me. 
And he was to marry, a girl who shone with beauty and light. 
And they loved each other, and with me watched the sunsets into night. 
And the waves crashing around me, the sand slips out to sea. 
And the winds that blow remind me, of what has been,          and what can never be. 
She'd had to leave us, my keeper he prayed for a safe return. 
But when the night came, the weather to a raging storm had turned. 
He watched her ship fight, but in vain against the wild and terrible wave. 
In me so helpless, as dashed against the rock she met her end. 
Then on the next day, my keeper found her washed up on the SHORE. 
He kissed her cold face, that they'd be together soon he'd swore. 
I saw him crying, watched as he buried her in the sand. 
And then he climbed my tower, and off of the edge of me he ran. 
I am a lighthouse, worn by the weather and the waves. 
And though I am empty, I still warn the sailors on their way.

6,Lakes Of Pontchartrain,The Be Good Tanyas,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-be-good-tanyas/lakes-of-pontchartrain-chords-970953,"It was on one fine March morning
When I bid New Orleans adieu.
And I was on the road to Jackson Town,
My fortunes to renew.
I cursed all foreign money,
No credit could I gain,
Which filled my heart with longing
For the lakes of Pontchartrain.
I sat on board a railway car
Beneath the morning sun,
And I rode the rails 'til evening
When I lay me down again.
All strangers there no friends to me,
'Til a dark girl towards me came,
And I fell in love with a Creole girl
On the lakes of Pontchartrain.
I said, 'My pretty Creole girl,
My money here's no good.
If it weren't for the alligators
I would sleep out in the woods.'
'You're welcome here, kind stranger.
Our house is very plain,
But we never turn a stranger out
On the lakes of Pontchartrain.'
She took me up to her mama's house,
And treated me right well.
Her hair upon her shoulders
In jet-black ringlets fell.
To try to paint her beauty
I'm sure 'twould be in vain,
So handsome was my Creole girl
On the lakes of Pontchartrain.
I asked her would she marry me,
But she said it never would be,
For she had got a lover and
He was off at sea.
She said that she would wait for him,
And faithful she'd remain,
Waiting for her sailor
On the lakes of Pontchartrain.
So fare you well, my bonny ol' girl.
I may never see you no more,
But I won't forget your kindness
In that cottage by the shore.
At every social gathering
A golden glass I'll drain,
And I'll drink a health to the Creole girl
On the lakes of Pontchartrain.

but what a thrill I got, when I sat behind the wheel.
I opened up the glove box and that’s when I found the note
The date was 1966 this is what he wrote:
He said my name is Private Andrew Malone
and if you’re reading this then I didn't make it home
But for every dream that’s shattered, another one comes true
this car was once a dream of mine, now it belongs to you
and though you may take her and make her your own
You'll always be rid-ing with Private Malone.
Well it didn’t take me long, I had her running good
I loved to hear those horses thunder underneath her hood.
I had her shining like a diamond and I’d put the ragtop down
All the pretty girls would stop and stare as I drove her through town
The buttons on the radio didn’t seem to work quite right,
But it picked up that oldies show, especially late at night  
Sometimes I thought that if I’d turn real quick I’d see,
A soldier riding shotgun, in the seat right next to me.
It was a young man named Private Andrew Malone
Who fought for his country and never made it home
But for every dream that’s shattered, another one comes true
this car was once a dream of his, back when it was new
and he told me to take her and make her my own
And I was proud to be rid-ing with Private Malone
One night it was rainin' hard and I took the curve to fast
I still don’t remember much about that fiery crash
Someone said they thought they saw a soldier pull me out
they didn’t get his name, but I know without a doubt...
It was a young man named Private Andrew Malone
Who fought for his country and never made it home
But for every dream that’s shattered, another one comes true
this car was once a dream of his, back when it was new
And I know I wouldn’t be here if he hadn’t tagged along
Oh, Thank-God I was rid-ing with Private Malone

A Virgin flight to Shannontown the day it didn't rain
The laughing eyes of Ireland sparkling blue and green
With hair as black as Guinness stout and barely seventeen
We're back out on the cobblestones whiskey drunk and high
Liquored up and gearing up for seven nights in Ireland 
The corner booth is waiting for the session to begin
It's quiet as a mother's prayer till we all stumble in
And it's fifty happy voices mixed with whistles made of tin
And a piper man is blowing like the North Atlantic wind
And an Eire island beauty is sawing on the violin 
I wonder will she miss me after seven nights in Ireland
It's Ladies' Day in Galway and we watched the ponies run
Fifty pounds against the odds and came in six to one
McSwiggin heard the race report, he invited us on in
So we drank Catholic whiskey with all our newfound friends
They raised a glass to all of us and we all toasted them
Here's to Michael, Tom and Pat and seven nights in Ireland
we kissed all the girls goodbye and gathered in our gear
And when she walked me to the gate I swear I saw a tear
But then she looked into my eyes I knew she felt my pain
And only then I realized we were standing in the rain
So save our places at the pub and when the eyes are dry again
We'll come back another day for seven nights in Ireland

Manhattan, is where it grew
And I thought, to cut it from its stem
And take it from the cracks between the bricks that it lay in
And save it, from city strife
Away from the city life
Then someone, they whispered in my ear
A country girl can't be made out of anybody here
Don’t touch it, it loves you not
Don’t touch it, it loves you not
Because blue birds, don't fly without their wings
And when we put them in a cage the world can't hear them sing
So selfish, when greed sets in
Possession, the king of sin
And people, don't ever let you down
Forever find a way to kill whatever life they've found
A heartbeat, and I want it too
Manhattan, is where she grew
So I left, and I let the flower be
And yesterday I saw the flower on cable TV
Much prettier, than here with me
For all of, the world to see
Much prettier than here with me

My back's about to break, no money in the bank And she don't call me anymore
I'm down my last drink It's time to sell my things 
And pack my bags and never look back Run a parallel line with the railroad tracks 
And make my getaway 
I'll put the pedal to the metal as the sun goes down 
Leave everyone sleepin in this sleepy town tonight 
   And at the break of day,  I'll be a runaway 
A hundred miles in, I've got a stupid grin On my scruffy face 
With every cigarette, I'm burnin my regret Don't wanna leave a trace 
And from my rear view, I've got a clear view Of who I used to be 
A little bit faster now Don't wanna turn around 
And pack my bags and never look back Run a parallel line with the railroad tracks 
And make my getaway 
I'll put the pedal to the metal as the sun goes down 
Leave everyone sleepin in this sleepy town tonight 
   And at the break of day,  I'll be a runaway          I'll be a runaway

But with every state line, somehow I find Another part of me YEA

For months I got myself in ruts 
Too much time spent in mirrors framed in yellow walls

And truth is cool but all that matters 
Is you have your good times

And I can't believe it when I hear the jokes they make
At anyone's expense except their own
Would they laugh if they knew who paid?

A young man ‘bout 21,
no different than you or I
He’s catchin’ catfish,
and gettin’ drunk
But Uncle Sam called,
he called him up,
Sent him out to Vietnam,
That young man,
Got his life turned upside down,
Turned his smile into a frown,
Robbed that king of his crown,
For an ideal he didn’t even know about,
He was gamblin’ at the wagon,when that army man showed up,
And he flashed that pen and paper,
And ole Fukie he signed up,
There’s gonna be a big time,
In the jungle,
Gonna be a firefight,
Gonna be a rumble,
Send me out to Vietnam,
I’ll fight ten men,
I got nothin’ left in the States for me,
I wanna see the world you see,
I know that Uncle Sam needs me,
To fight for an ideal I know nothing about.
Oh the drop point was dusty and the drill sergeant was loud,
And he could not see the corpses,
for the ragin’ dust cloud
Grab your duffle bags,
head to the checkpoint
Welcome to Vietnam boys,
you’re in for a hell of a fight,
Take it from the ones who know.
The army moves slow,
Hurry up and wait,
don’t sleep late,
And learn to hate your brother,
Before you hate your foe,
On patrol out in the rice fields,
Them choppers flew low,
Glancing up for the hand signal,
To tell you where to go,
Then the bombs started fallin’
And they pounded his brain,
And he thought about Eutaw,
And who was to blame,
For sendin’ him to Vietnam,

you keep framed in your parlour, with your bibles and guns,
the fetus of Christ with a fistful of scars.

Behold a white horse, with you on it's back,

Great waves of progress shall wet the air.

This old world is gonna rock,

Smote the water with a two by four,

Pharoh's army got drownded,

Missed that soul that he thought he had,

No more water, but fire next time,

Your class, your caste, your country, sect, your name or your tribe
There's people always dying trying to keep them alive
His body's decomposing in containers tonight
In an abandoned building where
A squatter's made a mural of a Mexican girl
With fifteen cans of spray paint in a chemical swirl
She's standing in the ashes at the end of the world
Four winds blowing through her hair
But when great Satan's gone, the whore of Babylon
She just can't sustain the pressure where it's placed
She caves
The Bible's blind, the Torah's deaf, the Qu'ran is mute
If you'd burn them all together you'd get close to the truth still
They're pouring over sanskrit on the ivy league moons
While shadows lengthen in the sun
Cast on a school of meditation built to soften the times
And hold us at the center while the spiral unwinds
It's knocking over fences, crossing property lines
Four winds, cry until it comes
And it's the song of man
Slouching towards Bethlehem
A heart just can't contain all of that empty space
It breaks, it breaks, (it breaks)
Well, I went back, I rent a Cadillac, a company jet
Like a newly orphaned refugee, retracing my steps
All the way to Cassadega to commune with the dead
They said, ""You'd better look alive""
And I was off to old Dakota where a genocide sleeps
In the black hills, the bad lands, the calloused east
I buried my ballast, I made my peace
With four winds, levelling the pines
But when great Satan's gone, the whore of Babylon
She just can't remain with all that outer space
She breaks, she breaks, she caves, she caves.

Raven thoughts blacken your mind until you're breathing in reverse     
All your friends and sedatives mean well but make it worse     
Every reassurance just magnifies the doubt     
Better find yourself a place to level out     
Got a cricket for a conscience always looks the other way     
A cocaine soul starts seeming like an empty cabaret     
Hey, where have all the dancers gone? Now the music doesn't play     
Tried to listen to the river but you couldn't shut your mouth     
Better take a little time to level out     
I never thought of running     
My feet just led the way     
Mixed up Signals     
Bullet Train     
Cars are switched out in the crazy rain     
I could meet you any place     
If the Brakeman turns my way     
All this automatic writing I have tried to understand     
From a psychedelic angel who was tugging on my hand     
It's an infinite coincidence but it doesn't form a plan     
So I'm headed for New England or the Paris of the South     
Gonna find myself somewhere to level out     
Are your brothels full, Oh Babylon, with merry Middlemen?     
Never peer out of their periscopes from those deep opium dens     
All this death must need a counterweight always someone born again     
First a mother bathes her child then the other way around     
The Scales always find a way to level out     
I tried to pass for nothing     
But my dreams gave me away     
Mixed up Signals     
Bullet Train     
People snuffed out in the brutal rain     
I could live to any age     
If the Brakeman turns my way     
It is an old world it's hard to remember     
Like a dime store mystery     
I'm a repeat first time offender     
Who has rewritten history     
Mixed up tea leaves     
Phantom Pain     
Fuzzy logic in the crazy rain     
Getting better every day     
If the Brakeman turns my way     
Mixed up Signals     
Bullet Train     
Cars are switched out in the blinding rain     
He'll be smiling as he seals my fate     
When the Brakeman turns my way

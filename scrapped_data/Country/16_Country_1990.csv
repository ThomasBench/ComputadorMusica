0,One More Dollar,Gillian Welch,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/gillian-welch/one-more-dollar-chords-1117767,"A long time ago I left my home
For a job in the fruit trees
But I miss those hills with the windy pines
Their song seemed to suit me
So I sent my wages to my home
Said we'd soon be together
For the next good crop would pay my way
And I'd come home forever
One more dime to show for my day
One more dollar and I'm on my way
When I reach those hills, boys, I'll never roam
'Cause one more dollar and I'm going home
No work said the boss at the bunkhouse door
There's a freeze on the branches
So when the dice came out at the bar downtown
I rolled and I took my chances
One more dime to show for my day
One more dollar and I'm on my way
When I reach those hills, boys, I'll never roam
'Cause one more dollar and I'm going home
A long time ago I left my home
Just a boy passing twenty
Could you spare a coin and a Christian prayer
For my luck has turned against me
One more dime to show for my day
One more dollar and I'm on my way
When I reach those hills, boys, I'll never roam
'Cause one more dollar and I'm going home
One more dollar, boys, I'm going home

1,By The Mark,Gillian Welch,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/gillian-welch/by-the-mark-chords-666356,"When I cross over
I will shout and sing
I will know my savior by the mark
Where the nails have been.
By the mark where the nails have been
By the sign upon his precious skin
I will know my savior when I come to him
By the mark where the nails have been.
A man of riches
May claim a crown of jewels
But the king of heaven
Can be told from the prince of fools.
By the mark where the nails have been
By the sign upon his precious skin
I will know my savior when I come to him
By the mark where the nails have been.
On Calvary Mountain
Where they made him suffer so
All my sin was paid for
A long, long time ago.
By the mark where the nails have been
By the sign upon his precious skin
I will know my savior when I come to him
By the mark where the nails have been....

I was jumpin
Some days you gotta dance
Cause when the world doesn’t make no sense
And your feelin just a little too tense
You gotta loosen up those chains and dance
Well I was talkin’ with my baby
Over a small glass of tea
And he asked a load of questions
He said “How do you feel about me”
My mind was racing I was pacing
The words just a wouldn’t come
And there was only one thing left to do
I feel it coming onnnnnn
Some days you gotta dance
Cause when the world doesn’t make no sense

   Gave him everything she ever had

  Give a little... Take it back
    She'd tell him about her dreams... he'd just shoot them down

  Said only angels know how to fly.

  She keeps an eye... on the sky
  With a broken wing.... she carries her dreams
  Man, you ought to.. see her fly
  Sunday morning... she didn't go to church

   He went up to the bedroom.... found a note by the window
  with the curtains blowing in the breeze.

What can you say__ to that
Oh, he's made up his mind and there ain't nothing you can do
Maybe you drive all night
Trying to figure out where the whole thing started going wrong
And in the si-lence something begins to unravel
You never knew him like you'll be knowing him now___
Falling out of love and back into your life
Pulling your heart out from under the knife
Closing the door on all the dreams you used to know
Falling out of love and back on your feet
Turning away from that dead end street
Oh, and finding out that nothing feels as good as letting go
That's when he calls you up 
Out of the blue___ one day
And you know he thinks he's talking to the girl that you used to be
He's just a memory
Ain't it funny how his voice cracks when you're saying goodbye

8,Levelland,Robert Earl Keen,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/robert-earl-keen/levelland-chords-1146447,"Flatter than a tabletop
Makes you wonder why they stopped here
Wagon must have lost a wheel or they lacked ambition one
On the great migration west
Separated from the rest
Though they might have tried their best
They never caught the sun
So they sunk some roots down in the dirt
To keep from blowin' off the earth
Built a town around here
And when the dust had all but cleared
They called it Levelland, the pride of man
In Levelland
Granddad grew the dry land wheat
Stood on his own two feet
His mind got incomplete and they put him into the home
Daddy's cotton grows so high
Sucks the water table dry
Rollin’ sprinklers circle by
Bleedin' them to the bone
And I won't be here when it comes a day
It all dries up and blows away
I'd hang around just to see
But they never had much use for me in Levelland
They don't understand me out in Levelland
And I watch those jet trails carvin’ up that big blue sky
Coast to coasters watch 'em go
And I never would blame 'em one damn bit
If they never looked down on this
Not much here they'd wanna know
Just Levelland
Far as you can point your hand
Nothin' but Levelland
Mama used to roll her hair
Back before the central air
We'd sit outside and watch the stars at night
She'd tell me to make a wish
I'd wish we both could fly
Don't think she's seen the sky
Since we got the satellite dish and
I can hear the marching band
Doin' the best they can to play
""Smoke on the Water"", ""Joy to the World""
I've paid off all my debts
Got some change left over yet and I'm
Gettin' on a whisper jet
I'm gonna fly as far as I can get from Levelland
doin' the best I can
Out in Levelland - imagine that

I was sad you were bitter
But you were no quitter
When nothin' was all that we had
We were drinkin' a lot
We were thinkin' of tyin' the knot
Or maybe throw in the towel
Make up have a kid
Break up and we did
But only just for awhile
Then came lo mein and going insane
At the Chinese cafe way downtown
I was steamed I was fried but you stood by my side
When I had my nervous breakdown
There were noodles galore
All over the floor
And hot mustard sauce everywhere
But I held your hand
til you calmed down again
And picked out the rice in your hair
After that we agreed
When in fact what we need
Is to pack up and take the first plane
Take a bus take a bike
Take care take a hike
Take out but leave the lo mein
I remember it now when we order kung pao
And bow our heads to say grace
The day we left town and that nervous breakdown
At the all-you-can-eat Chinese place
At the Chinese cafe way downtown

Then we'd go driving for hours
Turn off the lights and just glide
Moving like spirits alone through the night
The light through the trees as our guide
All right, I miss you tonight 
And I'm not really sure what to say
It keeps rolling in like a slow moving train
It gets harder and harder each day
And each time I think that the worst of it's through
I am stopped in my tracks by some vision of you
All right, I miss you tonight
I admit that I'm fallin' down blue
Oh I'm fallin' down blue

You'll find out just who was your friend
Dont be sad, I know you will,
But dont give up until
True love finds you in the end.

Only if you're looking will it find you
Cause true love is searching too
But how can it recognize you
Unless you step out into the light, the light
Dont be sad, I know you will
But dont give up until
True love finds you in the end.
Dont be sad, I know you will
dont give up until....

  A foot of new snow on the ground
   You’re all bundled up in blankets
I’d give anything to be there with you now
I’d cover you in kisses, hold you in my arms
That’s all that I can think of,   every minute we’re apart
Darling I’ve been living,   for the moment that we touch
So I can cover you with kisses,   and wrap you in my love
  Baby, keep that fire burning
  Pour a glass of that sweet wine
   Let your hair down on your shoulders
   And I’ll be there just in time
To cover you in kisses, hold you in my arms
That’s all that I can think of,   every minute we’re apart
Darling I’ve been living,   for the moment that we touch
So I can cover you with kisses,   and wrap you in my love

Following a distant star to where he lay
Not being sure of what it meant
But knowing it was heaven sent they made their way
And the creatures gathered round
And didn't make a sound
And the angels cried
The angels knew what was to come
The reason God had sent His Son from up above
It filled their hearts with joy to see
And knowing of His destiny came tears of love
And the creatures gathered round
And didn't make a sound
And the angels cried
I've often thought about that night
And wondered if they realized that star so bright
Was sent to tell all the land
The Son of God would soon become the Son of man
And the creatures gathered round
And didn't make a sound
And the angels cried
And the angels cried
And the angels cried

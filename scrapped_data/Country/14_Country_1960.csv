And get it all off my shoulders.
Say the things you used to say,
And make the world, go  away.
Do you remember when you loved me,
Before the world took me astray?
If you do, then forgive me,
And make the world, go away.
Make the world go away,
And get it all off my shoulders.
Say the things you used to say,
And make the world, go  away.
I’m so sorry, if I hurt you.
I’ll make it up, day by day.
Say you love me, like you used to,
And make the world, go away.

And get it all off my shoulders.
Say the things you used to say,
And make the world, go  away.

    And at dinner time we stopped and walked back to the house to eat,

    And then she said, ""I got some news this mornin' from Choctaw Ridge.
    Today Billy Joe MacAllister jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge.""
2. And Papa said to Mama as he passed around the blackeyed peas,
    ""Oh, Billy Joe never had a lick of sense, pass the biscuits, please.
    There's five more acres in the lower forty I've got to plough.""
    and Mama said it was shame about Billy Joe, anyhow.
    ”Seems like nothin' ever comes to no good up on Choctaw Ridge,
    and now Billy Joe MacAllister's jumped off the Tallahatchie Bridge.”
3. And Brother said he recollected when he and Tom and Billie Joe
    put a frog down my back at the Carroll County picture show.
    And wasn't  I  talkin' to him after church last Sunday night?

    I saw him at the sawmill yesterday on Choctaw Ridge,

And I could end up to claim his daughter's hand.
Now I'm up here in Alaska lookin' around for gold (around for gold)
like a crazy fool I'm a-diggin' in these frozen ground, so cold
But with each new day I pray I'll strike it rich and then
I'll go back home and claim my love in Saginaw, Michigan
I wrote my love (I wrote my love) in Saginaw, Michigan (in Saginaw, Michigan)
I said, ""Honey, I'm comin' home please wait for me
And you can tell your dad I'm comin' back a richer man
I've hit the biggest strike in Klondike history.""
Her dad met me (her dad met me) in Saginaw, Michigan (in Saginaw, Michigan)
He threw me a great big party with champagne
And he said, ""Son, you're a wise, young, ambitious man,
Will you sell your father all your Klondike claim?""
Now he's up there in Alaska diggin' in the cold, cold ground
The greedy fool is lookin' for the gold I never found
It serves him right and no one here is missin' him

We're the happiest man and wife in Saginaw, Michigan
He's ashamed to show his face in Saginaw, Michigan

My beard a roughnin coal pile and a dirty hat pulled low across my face.                     
Through cupped hands round a tin can, I pretend to hold you to my breast and find

Feet wide apart on the floor
I hadn't noticed but there on his hip
Was a short-barreled Bass Forty-Four
It was plain he was ready and waitin'
He leaned a bit forward and said
When you call me Shorty, say Mister, my friend
Maybe you'd rather be dead
In the room was a terrible silence
As the big one stepped out on
the floor
All drinkin' stopped and the tick
Said death would wait ten seconds more
He cursed once or twice in a whisper
And he said with a snarl on his lips
Nobody's Mister to me, little man!
And he grabbed for the gun on his hip
But the little man's hands was
like lightning
The Bass Forty-Four was the same
The Forty-Four spoke and it sent lead and smoke
And seventeen inches of flame
For the big one had never cleared
leather
Beaten before he could start
A little round hole had appeared on his shirt
The bullet went clear through
his heart
The little man stood there a moment
Then holstered the Bass Forty-Four
It's always this way so I never stay
Slowly he walked out the door
Nobody knew where he came from
They won't forget he came by
They won't forget how a Forty-Four gun
One night made the difference in size
As for me, I'll remember the sadness
Shown in the eyes of the man
If we meet someday, you can bet I would say
That it's me, Mr. Shorty, your friend

Long as there's a valley then the river can flow free
As long as there's a sun there's a shadow
As long as there's a shadow there's a place for you and me
Secret place to run and hide a secret love can't be denied
A secret place that no one knows but you and me

Long as there's a valley then the river can flow free

49,I Cant Help It (ver 2),Hank Williams,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/hank-williams/i-cant-help-it-chords-1487486,"Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I Can't Help It If I'm Still In Love With You
Somebody else stood by your side
And he looked so satisfied
I Can't Help It If I'm Still In Love With You 
A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you  
Then suddenly I got that old time feeling
I Can't Help It If I'm Still In Love With You
It's hard to know another's lips will kiss you
And hold you just the way I used to do
Oh heaven only knows how much I miss you
I Can't Help It If I'm Still In Love With You

Like the way you used to be or is it changing?
Does it deepen over time
Like the river that is winding through the canyon?
Are you still in love with her?
Do you remember how you were before the sorrow?
Are you closer for the tears
Or has the weight of all the years left you hollow?
Are we strangers now?
Like the Ziegfeld Gal and the Vaudeville show?
Are we strangers now
Like rock and roll and the radio?
Like rock and roll and radio
I can see you lyin' there
Tying ribbons in your hair and pullin' faces
I can feel your hand in mine
Though we’re living separate lives in separate places
Are we strangers now?
Like the Ziegfeld Gal and the Vaudeville show?
Are we strangers now
Like rock and roll and the radio?
Like rock and roll and radio
     All these white lies hanging like flies on the wall
Hard wired, road tired
Counting curtain calls and waiting
Waiting for the axe to fall
Are you still in love with me
Like the way you used to be or is it changing?
Does it deepen over time
Like the river that is winding through the canyon?
Are we strangers now?
Like the Ziegfeld Gal and the Vaudeville show?
Are we strangers now
Like rock and roll and the radio?
Like rock and roll and radio

Playin' it upside down, Dancin' around in front of our tv
I can't see the ballgame So I just wave my lighter and say
Yeah, rock on baby I'd rather watch you anyway
But when you're done can I come backstage
And get you to sign your name
On that zeppelin shirt of mine you're wearin'
I'll never wash that thing again
Yeah 
And she's my kinda crazy
Lord they'll never get old 
She's too cute to get on my last nerve
The way she throws her little fits pokin' out her lip and bitin' mine when we kiss
There ain't a fight that she can't win
That's my baby and she's my kinda crazy
You ought to see her in my pickup she's gotta have that radio up
Bless her heart, she can't sit still head in my lap, bare feet on the windshield
Says, C'mon baby let me drive
Now honey it's a stick shift
Remember what you did last time
Yeah 
And she's my kinda crazy
Lord they'll never get old 
She's too cute to get on my last nerve
The way she throws her little fits pokin' out her lip and bitin' mine when we kiss
There ain't a fight that she can't win
That's my baby and she's my kinda crazy
She never lets me rest she keeps me up all night 
She'll roll me off the bed steal the covers off my side
But I hear wake up sleepy head and I open up my eyes
And it's all worth the while
Yeah 
And she's my kinda crazy
Lord they'll never get old 
She's too cute to get on my last nerve
The way she throws her little fits pokin' out her lip and bitin' mine when we kiss

Walls that make up barricades and graves
Daddy's little empire built by hand and built by slaves
From the sky we look so organized and brave
In the heat I saw you rising from the dirt
Drunken tears and tugging at your skirt
If only you could tell me then what part of you got hurt
In the heat I saw you rising from the dirt
Take my hand baby we're over land 
I know flying over water makes you cry
Where's that liquor cart?
Maybe we shouldn't start
But I can't say for the life of me say why
From the sky to highway straight as it could be
A string pulled tight home from Tennessee
Still somehow these ditches took the better part of me
From the sky to highway straight as it could be
Take my hand baby we're over land 
I know flying over water makes you cry
Been in the sky so long
Seems like the long way home
But I can't for the life of me say why

Did we leave our love behind?

A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone

Ask any ol' barstool

and song spillin' out off of every page
Sweet Amarillo, tears on my pillow
You never will know how much I cried
Sweet Amarillo, like a wind in the willow
Damn this old cowboy for my foolish pride
So I drifted on down from the Iron Ore range
Caught the wide Missouri where the cool waters flow
When I got to Topeka, I looked up your name
but they said you rode off with the last rodeo
Sweet Amarillo, tears on my pillow
You never will know how much I cried
Sweet Amarillo, like a wind in the willow
Damn this old cowboy for my foolish pride
Well, the thunders are rumblin'
and the rodeo clowns are paintin' their face
I'm gunnin' the throttle for Llano Estacado  
on a wild appaloosa I'm blowing your way
Down in old Amarillo there's a light in the window
where a road weary shadow drifts into the arms
of a long distance lover, then they turn back the covers
and dance the Redova till the light of the dawn

Stitches on my body, closets full of bones
Blood that won't stop running cos this wound won't ever clot
Like the ringing in my ears, that don't ever seem to stop
I hear voices from the basement, scratching on the roof
Seeing visions of you wasted, mumbling to the moon
Conjuring some darkness from the shadows in your room
Where I sold my hallelujah when I laid my soul in you
Love ain't nothing more  than black magic
You better want what you wish for
It might happen
Day awakes the night and then I die for what I've done
As-phyxiating slow below an ugly setting sun
I try to breathe but yellow smoke keeps burning up my lungs
I found the words to say but they just blister on my tongue
Love ain't nothing more  than black magic
You better want what you wish for
It might happen
I drank your poison
Fell under your spell
Love is hell and nothing more than black magic
Love is like a bag of drugs it blows out both your knees
Innocence gets tangled when you hang it on a string
Both our eyes were foggy glass too high to ever see
The devil's sleight of hand twisting fate with ancient ink, Cos
love ain't nothing more  than black magic
You better want what you wish for

 I get ugly when the whiskey flows
Wanted you to know I love you so
And I would kill before I let you go

Wearing someone else's name
Brought you in this world and I
can take you from it just the same
If you leave for Mississippi
I will beat you at your game

Heard your whispering your plans to run
Off to marry some rich man's son
I bet he's never met a poor man's gun
In the darkness you could not see
The drunken devil instructed me
Two bullets in a crimson sea
Now I'm certain that you'll never be
Taking off for Mississippi

Brought you in this world and I

When the righteousness of you sets in
And the blood in my veins begins
to ramble on

stand and judge the execution man
But we all have to make a trembling stand

Can your branches carry me
Before the war, before the wine
Before I stole what wasn't mine
Can you bring my baby back to me

And I laughed
He got mad and slammed the door
Your daddy's gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn't change one thing
Baby, yeah
I know it sounds crazy
But there was somethin bout the way
The blue lights were shinin
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you
Going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
Running for it
Would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
Innocent
But you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car
Side by side
And locked in tight
They were taking their time
But we didn't mind
We talked and we laughed
We sat real close
By the time they let us go
I was already gone
But there was somethin bout the way
The blue lights were shinin
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you
Going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
Running for it
Would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
Innocent
But you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

oh i'm haunted by the bottle
and the taste of death on my breath callin
so i fought with my reflection
now there's broken mirrors and blood and tears all around
lord i'm a fool
lord i'm a fool
lord i'm a fool
lord i'm a fool
and if i should fall from grace
would you want me babe
even if i was ruined
and oh could you find a way
for my soul to save
even if it might ruin you too
and i've never known the reason
that you know my heart and fell in love with who i am
lord i'm a fool
lord i'm a fool
lord i'm a fool
lord i'm a fool
and if i should fall from grace
would you want me babe
even if i was ruined
and oh could you find a way
for my soul to save
even if it might ruin you too
oh lover, hear me cryin
lord i'm stumblin through the darkness can't find my way home

48,You (ver 2),Chris Young,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/chris-young/you-chords-1078437,"The bluest skies don't seem so blue
And the stars seem to be a little dimmer too
Now that you're around you put them all to shame
Let me break it down cause what I'm trying to say is
No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I've never found anything that makes me feel like I do about
You 
Got a whole new direction it seems these days
I use to rush off from work and get home late
But now I show up late and rush back home
My priorities are different I can't leave you alone
No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I've never found anything that makes me feel like I do about
You 
Girl if you ever get to guessing if I'm thinking bout you    
No one gets me like you when you kiss me
Girl you rock me harder than some downtown band
I thought I knew what love was but I didn't have a clue
I've never found anything that makes me feel like I do about
You 
   You  oh you

Tears rollin' out of her eyes
No messin' with a made-up mind
Sun settin' on goodbye
Yeah, it's hard to believe
It wasn't me tryin' to leave this time
It ain't always the cowboy
That ain't got a lot of hang around
Ain't got no settle down in their boots
Gone's just what they do
That restless running
Searching for something
 Leaving love in the dust of a midnight Chevrolet
It ain't always the cowboy that rides away
I've never seen over from this side
Never heard lonely get this quiet
Still, I can't keep from smiling
'Cause damn, that girl can fly
It ain't always the cowboy
That ain't got a lot of hang around
Ain't got no settle down in their boots
Gone's just what they do
That restless running
Searching for something
 Leaving love in the dust of a midnight Chevrolet
It ain't always the cowboy that rides away
A tumbleweed heart chasin' that wind
Goin' too far, wherever that is
It ain't always the cowboy
That ain't got a lot of hang around
Ain't got no settle down in their boots
Gone's just what they do
That restless running
Searching for something
 Leaving love in the dust of a midnight Chevrolet
It ain't always the cowboy that rides away
Rides away
It ain't always the cowboy

Whoever's dear to you hold them close tonight
‘Cause you never know what will come
Morning breaks and it’s just you and the shakes
If you made the right decision then you’re gone
Your broken promises are thrown out in the yard
How they glisten in the dawn
And in the cold you feed your fiddle to the stove
Screaming like a Banshee all night long
My hands are raw from working through the fall
Just to make my way back to you
If what it takes is to live out my mistakes
Then honey I will pay my dues
Hard to recall when did this world get so damn small
And my body so worn and used
It’s harder yet to forgive and forget
When my memories are laced and blue
That broken record starts playing on its own
Spinning out when no one else is home
And if you listen ‘til the end
It flips itself and plays again
All night long
It’s not the songs or when the lights turn off and on
Or the screaming in my head that never ends
It’s not your ghost that haunts me the most
But the fact that we may never meet again
My hands are raw from working through the fall
Just to make my way back to you
If what it takes is to live out my mistakes
Then honey I will pay my dues
Hard to recall when did this world get so damn small
And my body so worn and used
It’s harder yet to forgive and forget
When my memories are laced and blue ooh, ooh, ooh

Lost as a ball in a field full of corn
Further away than he ever imagined
That he'd ever end up from the place he was born
Now no more forlorn as the Creeker drank whiskey
Than the one that you see outside of your eye
Drinkin' alone as he looks out the window
At all of the strangers on the corner outside
He'd rather be dead than alive one more minute
In this godforsaken town
When he was a kid, Lord, he'd never have dreamt it
All the ways that the city can bring a country boy down
Now they knew not his name and he knew not their faces
And he knew not the how nor the reason for why
You could ever wake up and wanna keep on a-livin'
In a place where a friend is such a hard thing to find
And for everyone you meet, there's a whole mess of people
Tryin' like hell to pull you on down
To the level they're on and the trouble they're tendin'
In the mess that they've made, in the gutter they found
He'd rather be dead than alive one more minute
In this godforsaken town
When he was a kid, Lord, he'd never have dreamt it
All the ways that the city can bring a country boy down
Some fellas do pills and things of that nature
Some fellas chase girls to hang on their arm
Some fellas get by on practically nothin'
Some fellas get pissed in a small corner bar

Like the dust I spit from my mouth.

Wooa Wooa oooo oo oo oooooooo oo oo oooooooo oo

Where I killed all my best friends.
We gambled it away with the whiskey open keg,
And we never saw it again.
Well I had a wife that I met back in high school;
Her name was Lyla-Jean.
We saved away to escape some place
On a local miner's minor pay.

At Least 27 times.
It fell through the floorboards into deep dark darkness,

My eyes adjust,
my joints are rusty,
sheets are awful cold and dusty,
roll over folks it must have been another night on the bend.
Kick rocks,
slept in socks,
BooLahLah and levee walks,
this couch is my kingdom and I swear there’s bugs in my head.
Sick sad and sentient,
a penny saved a penny spent,
asleep at the wheel sure beats being awake in my bed.
Last call to feel small,
I dread the sight of alcohol,
I don’t know where this train stops but I want off.
Been rather low,
out here together.
Reckon that we’ll keep trying if
rock bottom it never shows
You’re not alone,
if there’s a storm to weather
I aint welcome at home, I don’t know about you
Double takes and double stops,
I double dare ya call the cops,
I’ll die where I stand if I hear wagon wheel again.
40 days of foggy nights,
withered by the city lights,
I don’t remember existential crisis being part of the deal.
I told you once I told you twice,
I’m steeped in verse and cursed in vice,
I traded my 40 acres for a mountain of pain.
Hotdamn Hamm’s can,
blinded in the promised land,
I don’t mind if I do declare: we’re as good as dead.
Been rather low,
out here together.

Sit and drink cerveza by the shore

You don't care where I'm buying
Your ring
Girls today will drink all day
To fall in love with any boy they see
You're a sight of utmost beauty
Utmost strength and utmost loyalty
So I'll sit here and drink all night
Talk about the Lord's delight in you
If my mama could just see you laugh
I know that she could see the shine in you

 So I followed that preacher man down to the river and now I'm 
 Changed
 And now I'm stronger
 There must've been something in the water
 Oh there must've been something in the water
 Well I heard what he said and I went on my way
 Didn't think about it for a couple of days
 Then it hit me like a lightning late one night
 I was all out of hoping, all out of fight
 Couldn't fight back my tears so I fell on my knees
 Saying God if you're there come and rescue me
 Felt love pouring down from above
 Gotta washed in the water, washed in the blood and now I'm 
 Changed
 And now I'm stronger
 There must be something in the water
 Oh there must be something in the water
 And now I'm singing all along to Amazing Grace
 Can't nobody wipe this smile off my face
 Got joy in my heart, angels on my side
 Thank God Almighty, I saw the light
 Gonna looked ahead, no turning back
 Live everyday, give it all that I have
 Trusting someone bigger than me
 Ever since the day that I believed I am 
 Changed
 And now I'm stronger
 There must be something in the water
 Oh there must be something in the water
 There must be something in the water
 Oh there must be something in the water
I was lost     but now I'm found 
Was blind but now    I see

go call on all the town

My sister will grow, my mother will know

He set up shop on Sunset
He put me up at the  Marquis
He said you want to sell a million records boy
You better listen to me
He said change your style, whiten your smile 
you could lose a couple pounds
And if you want to live this life
You better lose that wife
Do ya need your friends around?

Cause the biggest things in life are your friends and family
And I like my jeans and my old tshirts
and couple extra pounds never really hurt
And a country boy is all Ill ever be....
Cause Hank taught me just how to stay alive
Youll never catch me out the house without my .9 or .45
I got a big orange tracker and a diesel truck
My idea of heaven is chasing white tail bucks
And as a country boy I know I can survive
Now two flags fly above my land
That really sum up how I feel
One is the colors that fly high and proud
The red, the white, the blue
The other ones got a rattlesnake 
with a simple statement made
""Don't Tread On Me"" is what is says 
and I'll take that to my grave
Because.....    this is me
Im proud to be American and strong in my beliefs
And Ive said it before but Ill say it again
Cause I never needed a government to hold my hand
And Ive said it before but Ill say it again
Cause my familys always fought and died to save this land

I feel the wheels like a melody
Like a radio dialin’ in strong
C'mon, c'mon sing along
Sing along to my backroad song
Ooh
Ooh
The only way today could get better
Girl what I'm thinkin'
Is I can pick you up, you slide in this truck
And I can hear you singin’
Ooh
Let me hear you sing it
Ooh
Ooh
Freedom is the miles we're rollin' on
Ooh
Out here cruisin’ to a backroad song
I feel the wheels like a melody
Like a radio dialin’ in strong
C'mon, c'mon sing along
Sing along to my backroad song
C'mon, c'mon sing along
Sing along to my backroad song
This is my backroad song
Ooh (Feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)
This is my backroad song
Ooh (Feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)
Come on, come on, sing along
Ooh (Feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)
To my backroad song
Ooh (Feel the rhythm of it, feel the rhythm of it)

46,The Devil Wears A Suit And Tie,Colter Wall,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/colter-wall/the-devil-wears-a-suit-and-tie-chords-1962237,"Reverend, reverend
Please come quick
'Cause I've got something to admit
I met a man out in the sticks
A good old mess
He drove a series 10 Cadillac and wore a cigar on his lip
Don't you know the devil wears a suit and tie
So I'm driving down the 61' in early July
White as a cotton field and sharp as a knife
I heard him howling as he passed me by
I know you, I know you young man
I know you by the state of your hands
You're a six-string picker
Just as I am
Let me learn you something
I know a few turns to make all the girls dance
Don't you know the devil wears a suit and tie
So I'm driving down the 61' in early July
White as a cotton field and sharp as a knife
I heard him howling as he passed me by
Foolish, foolish was I
Damn my foolish eyes
'Cause that man's lessons
Had a price, oh sweet price
My sweet soul, everlasting
A very own eternal light
Don't you know the devil wears a suit and tie
So I'm driving down the 61' in early July
White as a cotton field and sharp as a knife
I heard him howling as he passed me by
Don't you know the devil wears a suit and tie
So I'm driving down the 61' in early July
White as a cotton field and sharp as a knife
I heard him howling as he passed me by

When it seems like the whole world is against you
Don't be afraid, Life is unkind
You can let go of the pain if you choose to
'Cause time slips away, Skies fall apart
Revealing to all a universal heart
Glowing, flowing, all around you
There will be nights that go on forever
Like you're long-lost at sea never to be found
Just know in your heart that we're always together
And long after I'm gone I'll still be around
'Cause our bond is eternal and so is love
God is inside you all around you and up above
Knowing, showing, you the way
Time slips away, Skies fall apart
It ain't too hard, A universal heart
Glowing, flowing, all around you

48,The Life You Chose,Jason Isbell,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jason-isbell/the-life-you-chose-chords-1756174,"Who are you if not the one I met
One July night before the town went wet
Jack and coke in your mama's car
You were reading The Bell Jar
Where are you if you're not on your own
Always lonely, never quite alone
Where's the Jesus that you swore you'd find
After running the last line
Are you living the life you chose
Are you living the life that chose you
Are you taking the grown up dose
Do you live with a man who knows you
Like I thought I did back then
But I guess I never did, who did I kid?
I got lucky when I finished school
Lost three fingers to a faulty tool
Settled out of court, I'm no one's fool
You probably knew
There's plenty left to make a getaway
I've spent enough nights in the bluegrass state
We could go somewhere where people stay up late
Or just somewhere new
Are you living the life you chose
Are you living the life that chose you
Are you taking the grown up dose
Do you live with a man who knows you
Like I thought I did back then
But I guess I never did, who did I kid?
Here I am inviting you to throw your life away
A victim of nostalgia maybe take away
Just tonight I realized that I am still in your backseat
Nothing I've had since has meant a thing to me
Are you living the life you chose
Are you living the life that chose you
Are you taking the grown up dose
Do you live with a man who knows you
Like I thought I did back then
But I guess I never did, who did I kid?

I said but I feel the same
She said well let me explain
Baby how things can change
I said but that doesn't show
How a love that could grown
Would become so estranged
She said well baby things change
She said, Na, na, na, na, na
Baby, don't try
To figure this out
Or ask quesitons 'bout why
Forever's a promise
No love can survive
And trust with hearts
Just don't apply
'Cause baby, things change
Na, na, na, na, na, now, now 
I quit tryin'
To figure things out
About all your heart's lyin'
Forever's a promise
We couldn't survive
Hey, I may be slow
But I ain't blind
She said, I still love you so
I said, I don't care to know
She said, You once cried my name
I said, Well baby, things change
And let's don't go placing no blame
'Cause you know things can change
Na, na, na, na, na, na

She was gone before I got home
She'd been getting restless
In that big house all alone
I've been up and down these city streets
For three nights in a row
And lord it's hard to find that girl
When she gets the urge to go
It's kinda like a lost and found
In a border town
Askin' bout a diamond ring
They just look at you
Like you've lost your mind
Say they haven't seen a thing
But I know she's been here lately
I can still smell her perfume
And she gets crazy on a full moon
And I know she'll be coming back
Her car is waiting right outside
But, I don't want to think about
Who's taking her for a ride
And her unpredictability
Is what I love about her best
Lord I've got to find her quick
Before she does something I regret
She's out there somewhere
Burnin up the night
Somehow I've got to run her down
I'm running out of time

Of all the things I've always meant to say
But the words didn't come easily
So many times through empty fears
Of all the nights I tried to pick up the phone
So scared of who might be answering
You try to live your life from day to day
But seeing you across the room tonight
Just gives me away
'Cause the heart won't lie
Sometimes life gets in the way
But there's something that won't change, I know I've tried
The  heart won't lie
You can live your alibi
Who can see you're lost inside a foolish disguise
The heart won't lie___
Long after tonight
Will you still hear my voice through the radio
Old desires make us act carelessly
Long after tonight, after the fire
After the scattered ashes fly
Through the four winds blown and gone
Will you come back to me?
You try to live your life from day to day
But seeing you across the room tonight
Gives me away
'Cause the heart won't lie
Sometimes life gets in the way
But there's something that won't change, I know I've tried
The  heart won't lie
You can live your alibi

Try to hide in the hole in the wall

Your ridin' for a fall

The frost settles in on the sage
The night's gettin' colder, and man your gettin older
Tonight your feelin' your age
So why don't you turn back, just saddle up and back track

Took the only flag we had in town.

I dream at night about you coming home.
The train in the station, your uniform on fire
As you stepped onto the platform the band plays a little louder,
And as we embrace your cap falls off.

We are swimming with the snakes at the bottom of the well
So silent and peaceful in the darkness where we fell
But we are not snakes and what’s more we never will be
And if we stay swimming here forever we will never be free
I heard ‘em ringin’ the bells in heaven and hell
They got a secret they’re gettin ready to tell
Its fallin’ from the skies, callin’ from the graves
Open your eyes boy I think we are saved
Open your eyes boy I think we are saved
Let’s take a walk on the bridge right over this mess
Don’t need to tell me a thing baby, we’ve already confessed
And I raise my voice to the air...and we were blessed
  It's hard to give
  It's hard to get
But everybody needs a little forgiveess.
We are calling for help tonight on a thin phone line.
As usual we’re havin’ ourselves one helluva time.
And the planes keep flyin’ over our heads no matter how loud we shout
   Hey....Hey...Heyyy
And we keep wavin’ and wavin’ our arms in the air but we’re all tired out
I heard somebody say...today’s the day
A big old hurricane...she’s blowin’ our way,
Knockin’ over the buildings,
Killin’ all the lights.
  Open your eyes boy, we made it through the night.
  Open your eyes boy, we made it through the night.

Don’t need to tell me a thing baby, we’ve already confessed

Could hold you a light

When the potbellied thieves
chase their unwelcome guest

if robbing the rich is for worse or for best
They take it by stealing and lying and gambling
And I take it my way, my shiny Black Bess
I treat horses good and I'm friendly to strangers
I ride and your running makes my guns talk the best
And the rangers and deputies
are hired by the rich man
To catch me and hang me, my shining Black Bess
Yes, they'll catch me napping one day and they'll kill me
And then I'll be gone but that won't be my end
For my guns and my saddle will always be filled
By unwelcome travellers and other brave men
And they'll take the money and spread it out equal

But the men that go riding to help these poor workers
The rich will cut down like an unwelcome guest

Burning up the charts
With songs about things we all know

'Cause all good things, they gotta go
Well there's a child on the way
It could be any day
But how this life will change we don't know
Well there's a child on the way
Gonna look just like him
One day, he's gonna say
""Ain't you my dad?""
Then he's gonna look down and smile
And after a while, he'll say
""That's for sure, 'cause you got my eyes.""

Swinging from the beams
With a light shining off the lake
Well, I know I made mistakes
I'm passing then all on
But I hope he gets up before dawn
There's a dreamer in my dreams
Climbing up the back
Of a car they used to call a Cadillac
It's got a brand new set of keys
He's got a new look, he's got a new look
And he's gonna, he's gonna take it all away
There's a dreamer in my dreams

All jacked up in my garage

And he can't give that to her and she can't find it with him
So she'll have to find her way out of love she's not really in
She can live with what goes with leaving
She knows it's the only way

She can't live with herself if she stays
She could settle for what she'd be feeling
If she gave in and worked this one out

She wants the kind of love she can't live without

But she can't be his forever, she can't even be his for now

There was a letter from mamma, when she went out to Reno
To help her sister out in 62
And a flower from Hawaii, when they went on vacation
It was the first time that my Daddy ever flew
And the pocket knife I gave to him on Fathers day
Years ago, I thought it had been lost

But that was long before we found the box

I saw the love he kept inside the first time we opened up the box
There was a picture that was taken, when he and Mom were dating
Standing by his 1944,
And the faded leather Bible, he got when he was baptised
I guess no one understood him like the Lord
And the poem that he had written, about his wife and children
The tender words he spoke were quite a shock

Oscar was a walker, at least four miles twice a day
The entire length of main street he'd be shoutin' all the way

It was a happy song, sung slightly out of tune
And he'd say, ""Everyone will die and go to
heaven.
And we will all be angels some day-aa-aa.
And what you are in this world don't count for nothin'.
'Cause we are only children, we're just lost along the way.

Its just kind of broke a funny way
I was on my way through Houston
And I was headed for L.A.
Step inside this house girl
And I'll sing for you a song
I'll tell you bout just where I've been
it shouldn't take too long
I'll show you all the things that I own
My treasures you might say
It couldn't be more than ten dollars worth
they brighten up my day
This guitar was given me
By old man Thomas Gray
It's not too much to look at
But I play it every day
It's been across this country
Four or five times I guess
Between me and old man Tom
It never got much rest
Step inside this house girl
And I'll sing for you a song
I'll tell you bout just where I've been
it shouldn't take too long
I'll show you all the things that I own
My treasures you might say
It couldn't be more than ten dollars worth
they brighten up my day
Well that's just about all I own
All I care to I guess
Except this pair of boots maybe
And that funny yellow vest
And that leather jacket and that leather bag
And that hat hangin' on the wall
Just so it's not too much to carry babe
Could I see you again next Fall
Step inside this house girl
And I'll sing for you a song
I'll tell you bout just where I've been
it shouldn't take too long
I'll show you all the things that I own
My treasures you might say
It couldn't be more than ten dollars worth
they brighten up my day

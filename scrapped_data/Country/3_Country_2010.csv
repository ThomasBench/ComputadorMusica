Brave men fall with a battle cry
Tears fill the eyes of their loved ones and their brothers in arms
So it went, for Joseph Warren
It should have been different, it could have been easy
His rank could have saved him, but a country unborn needs bravery
And it spread like wildfire
   Wildfire
   Wildfire
From the ashes grew sweet liberty
Like the seeds of the pines when the forest burns
They open up, grow and burn again
It should have been different, it could have been easy
But too much money rolled in to ever end slavery
The cry for war spread like wildfire
   Wildfire
   Wildfire
Civil war came, civil war went
Brother fought brother, the south was spent
But its true demise was hatred, passed down through the years
It should have been different, it could have been easy
But pride has a way of holding too firm to history
And it burns like wildfire
   Wildfire
   Wildfire
  I was born a southern son
In a small southern town where the rebels run wild
 They beat their chest and they swear: we're gonna rise again
It should have been different, it could have been easy
The day that old Warren died, hate should have gone with it
But here we are, caught in the wildfire
   Wildfire
   Wildfire

Down them backroads windin' up at a Kickapoo Creek
Dancin' and singin' to some good ol' boys like me
Baby, there's a shooting star,
That one's for me an' you
So, hold me tight, an' make that wish, an' pray that it comes true
Now, I ain't sure of much,
but this I know
I got a diamond in my pocket an' my baby's got a heart of gold
I brought along a little courage and Coleman cooler, just to help me out
My hands are shakin' like a canebrake rattler, nothin's gonna save me now
Might as well jump in head first, lay it all on the line
What am I worried 'bout? Never gonna be a more perfect time
'Cause baby, there's a shooting star,
That one's for me and you
So, hold me tight, make that wish, and pray that it comes true
Now, I ain't sure of much,

but the crickets are singin' to the radio
an' we've got tickets

I hope I didn’t   ruin your whole vacation

Until you watch   the shadows cross the   ceiling
Well I don’t know,   but I can see it    snowing
In your car   the windows are   wide open

No you don’t have to      be alone
Just come on home.
Valentines   break hearts and minds at    random
That ol’ Easter egg   ain’t got a leg to    stand on
Well I can see   that you can’t win for    trying
And New Year’s Eve   is bound to leave you    crying
Come on home      come on home
No you don’t have to      be alone
Just come on home.
The moon and stars   hang out in bars just    talking
I still love   that picture of us    walking

I guess it could be worse it ain't that bad
least i ain't sitting in old baghdad
In the middle of the hot damn desert sitting in a tank
Lord how it tears me up to see her cry
Just a bunch of mopars guitars & other shit i can't buy
Well now lord if you can hear me won't you throw a damn dog a bone
Cause if the devil shows up with a better deal this old soul's going down
I sing 'em real pretty i sing 'em real sad
All the people in the crowd say he ain't half bad
They call me king turd up here on shit mountain but if you want it you can have the crown
Been sitting on my ass like a bump on a log
Watching andy and ol' boss hog
Guess i ought to get up and go find a job
Instead of sitting on the couch trying to find the next line
I'm sure there's gotta be a better use of my time
Like figuring out which one of these banks i'm gonna go rob
Or gas in my car and i drive a bronco
But i'll still be trying to figure out what the hell rhymes with bronco

Find a way back home, Make everything new
But I wish it was true.
Father, well I’ll give my soul to you
I came in blind folded for you
It was all that I knew.
Open your arms and I’ll fly out of hell up to you
I wish it was true.
Boy come on out from the cold
You're lost outside there don’t you know
It’s not what you say it what's you do
Just keep wishing your wishes are true
Well your dreams they're reality now
There’s no pain there’s no misery
Just polish the blood and the bruise
For there’s just no way you can lose.
Well I wish it was true.
Country, I was a soldier for you
I did what you asked me to
It was wrong and you knew.

Throw me away when you’re through.

Searching for the free man's ground
And he came to bet his fortune
On a West Virginia plow
He built a house of timber
And raised a redhead son
Then they worked the land together
And prayed the rain would come
There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations
With my bare feet in the river
Well the redhead's son got older
And took a brown eyed wife
And the fields were green as dollars
Cause the dirt was black as night
I came in late September
The youngest one of three
And my sisters off and married
So the land was left to me
There's a scarecrow in the garden
That looks like Lucifer
And I've been reading Revelations
With my bare feet in the river
I know every single fencepost
Every rock that goes around
I've been staring at the red oak
Where I know they'll lay me down
The fields ain't what they once were
The rains just seem to flood
And I've been thinking about that river
Wondering how it turned to blood
I've been sitting here all morning
I was sitting here all night

 Burning minutes every day by the hour
 Just to end up gone like everything else
 Let go of the pain, hold onto the rhythm
It's consciously held back in you
You're drowning a sorrow that's long been at rest
 The past is a hell, it can creep up inside you
So let me remind you of this
There's a reason your troubles exist
Spring lied to us again this year
Still I can't stand to face the fear
Will you always laugh about those things
 It's enough to make a man stay humble
 Everyday is just a new chance to stumble
 Just to end up gone like everything else
 If ever a time comes around in the wheel
To replace where we stand side by side
We'll be ready and able to fly
 Away from the mire
And the senseless decisions of somebody's wasted desire
Through the smoke and the wind and the fire
Spring lied to us this year again
Can't stand to face the fear again
You could always laugh about those things
It's enough to make a man feel sour
 Burning minutes every day by the hour
 Just to end up gone like everything else
 Remember the time we were both eye to eye
And we both knew the reasons why
Seemed like we faced the world on our own
 Before we collide can we just take a moment
Collecting reflections of this
And remember the paths that we chose
Spring lied to us this year again
Can't stand to face the fear again
Will you always laugh about those things
It's enough to make a man feel sour
 Burning minutes every day by the hour
 Just to end up gone like everything else

And pocket full of gold
And I've been out here now
All on my own
Well it's real quiet here
Just the way I like it here
There's no one to bother me
Except...
   In 1955, born into Wadena's pride
  I laid my head on that
   Milligan creek bed
   When I was a young man
  I helped build this land
Oh, I put down these rails as a CPR man
Thought I'd live forever
With my heart in my pocket
Oh, my gun by my side
And my feelings in a locket
Well, that was a cold year in Seventyseven
But I married my wife
We had 2 kids
I gave her a daughter
She gave me a son
And we rode those damn horses until we had none
Fists still like flyin'
Doing things for dyin'
Oh I should have put that old gun away
But I, I am me, a broken cowboy
And I don't feel right no more
'Cause I am a broken cowboy
Livin' life in the fast lane
Racing cars and robbing trains
I thought I had it all
Then one day I got the call
A father's worst dream
My son went down and I
The colours deceive me
As I see grey
Oh you're cutting me down with those
Cold words you're saying
Then you called me brother
But this can't be so 'cause you slander my name
Anywhere the wind will blow
But I, I am me, a broken cowboy
And I don't feel right no more
'Cause I am a broken cowboy
Yes I am broken cowboy
It's been a long dark dirty road
But a pocket full of gold
And I've been out here now
All on my own
Well it's real quiet here
Just the way I like it here
There's no one to bother me

I never sat by the shore, under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catching the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand
But here I am, next to you
The sky is more blue  in Malibu
Next to you  in Malibu
Next to you
We watched the sun go down as we were walking
I'd spent the rest of my life standing here talking
You would explain the current, as I try to smile
Hoping I just stay the same, and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while. Do we even exist?
That's when I make the wish, to swim away with the fish
Is it supposed to be this hot all summer long?
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song
But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue  in Malibu
Next to you  in Malibu
Next to you
Next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you
We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning
And you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start
A dream come true in Malibu.

Met Buddha yet another time
And he showed me the glowing light within 
But I swear that God is there, every time I glare
Into the eyes of my best... friend 
Says my son, it's all been done
Someday you're gonna wake up old and... gray
So go and try to have some fun, showing warmth to everyone 
You meet and greet... and cheat along the way
There's a gateway in our minds that leads somewhere out there
Far beyond this plane 
Where reptile aliens made of light
Cut you open, pull out all your pain 
Tell me how you make illegal
Something that we all make in our brain
Some say you might go crazy
Then again, it might make you go... sane 
Every time I... take a look... inside that old and... fabled book 
I'm blinded and... reminded of...
The pain caused by some old man in the sky
Marijuana... LSD... psilocybin... DMT...
They all changed... the way I see... 
But love's the only thing... that ever saved my life 
So, don't waste your mind on nursery rhymes or fairy tales of blood and wine 
It's turtles all the way down the line

To and through... the myth that... we all call... space and time

 Ain't no more favors from someone I don't know
'Cause there ain't nobody hear me, nobody's around
      Hallelujah,   coming home
Hallelujah,   he's dead and gone
Hallelujah,   something's wrong
Oh, hallelujah
 So tell me now if your singing can bring me
Another day with my feet on the ground
 I miss living and living misses me
I miss it so much that I'm holding me down
 For all the things that I never could change
For all the reasons that I never understood and why
I feel alone, baby, I'm dead and gone, baby
And something's wrong, 'cause you know I still feel alive
 My train is rolling down the line and I'm waiting till it bring me to dream
Of holding you up in my eyes
Oh feel my love, honey from up above, honey
Oh, don't give up on me, 'cause I'm coming down
 I'm not a one nighter, I'm not a flat liner
I've everything in between the harmony singing loud
      Hallelujah,   coming home
Oh, hallelujah,   he's dead and gone
Hallelujah,   something's wrong
Oh, hallelujah,           it's just a song
 The other day I found myself up on the corner
I thought I run into a friend of mine

49,Where Rainbows Never Die,The SteelDrivers,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-steeldrivers/where-rainbows-never-die-chords-1770640,"I'm an old man now, I can't do nothing
Young folks don't pay me no mind
But in my day I sure was something
Before I felt the heavy hand of time
I'm an old man now, I'm bound for glory
Time to lay these burdens down
Had enough of this old world of worry
Gonna trade my troubles for a crown
I will make my way across the fields of cotton
And wade through muddy waters one last time
And in my dreams I come out clean
When I reach the other side
West of where the sunsets, where rainbows never die
One more mile before I'm through
Casting off these earthly chains
Going where there's no more pain
I will make my way across the fields of cotton
And wade through muddy waters one last time
And in my dreams I come out clean
When I reach the other side
West of where the sunsets, where rainbows never die

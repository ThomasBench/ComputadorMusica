And the whole world is on your case,
I would offer you warm embrace,
To make you feel my love.
When evenin' shadows and the stars appear,
and there is no one there to dry your tears,
I could hold you for a million years,
to make you feel my love,
I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
but I would never do you wrong,
I've known it from the moment that we met,
No doubt in my mind where you belong,
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'go crawlin'down the avenue,
There ain't nothing that I wouldn't do,
to make you feel my love,
The storms are raging on the rollin sea,
And on the highway of regret,
The winds of change are blowin wild and free,
and you ain't see nothin' like me yet,
There's nothin that I wouldn't do,
Go to the ends of the earth for you,
make you happy make your dreams come true,
to make you feel my love.

4,Fancy,Reba McEntire,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/reba-mcentire/fancy-chords-595255,"/ ///// / ///// / ///// / //// /
I remember it all very well lookin' back
It was the summer I turned eighteen
We lived in a one room, rundown shack
On the outskirts of New Orleans
We didn't have money for food or rent
To say the least we were hard pressed
Then Mama spent every last penny we had
To buy me a dancin' dress
Mama washed and combed and curled my hair
and she painted my eyes and lips then I stepped into a satin
dancin' dress that had a split on the side clean up to my hip
It was red velvet trim and it fit me good
Standin' back from the lookin' glass
There stood a woman where a half grown kid had stood
She said here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Mama dabbed a little bit of perfume on my neck
And she kissed my cheek
Then I saw the tears wellin' up in her troubled eyes
When she started to speak
She looked at a pitiful shack
And then she looked at me and took a ragged breath
She said your Pa's run off and I'm real sick
And the baby's gonna starve to death
She handed me a heart shaped locket that said
""To thine own self be true""
And I shivered as I watched a roach crawl across
the toe of my high heeled shoe
It sounded like somebody else that was talkin'
Askin' Mama what do I do
She said just be nice to the gentlemen Fancy
And they'll be nice to you
She said, here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Lord forgive me for what I do, but if you want out
Well it's up to you
Now don't let me down you better start movin' uptown
Well that was the last time I saw my Ma
The night I left that rickety shack
The welfare people came and took the baby
Mama died and I ain't been back
But the wheel of fate had started to turn
And for me there was no way out
And it wasn't very long 'til I knew exactly
What my Mama'd been talkin' about
I knew what I had to do but I made myself this solemn vow
That I's gonna be a lady someday
Though I didn't know when or how
I couldn't see spending the rest of my life
With my head hung down in shame you know
I might have been born just plain white trash
But Fancy was my name
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
And I ain't done bad
Now in this world there's a lot of self-righteous hippocrits
And criticize Mama for turning me out
No matter how little we had
But though I ain't had to worry 'bout nothin'
For nigh on fifteen years
I can still hear the desparation in my poor
Mama's voice ringin' in my ear
She said, here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Here's your one chance Fancy don't let me down
Lord forgive me for what I do
But if you want out well it's up to you
Now don't let me down
Your Mama's goina help you uptown
I guess she did

5,Dublin Blues (ver 3),Guy Clark,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/guy-clark/dublin-blues-chords-1500479,"I wish I was in Austin
In the Chili Parlour Bar
Drinkin' Mad Dog Margaritas
And not carin' where you are
But here I sit in Dublin
Just rollin' cigarettes
Holdin' back and chokin' back
The shakes with every breath
Forgive me all my anger
Forgive me all my faults
There's no need to forgive me
For thinkin' what I thought
I loved you from the git go
I'll love you till I die
I loved you on the Spanish steps
The day you said goodbye
I am just a poor boy
Work's my middle name
If money was a reason
I would not be the same
I'll stand up and be counted
I'll face up to the truth
I'll walk away from trouble
But I can't walk away from you
Forgive me all my anger
Forgive me all my faults
There's no need to forgive me
For thinkin' what I thought
I loved you from the git go
I'll love you till I die
I loved you on the Spanish steps
The day you said goodbye
I have been to Fort Worth
I have been to Spain
I have been to proud
To come in out of the rain
I have seen the David
I've seen the Mona Lisa too
I have heard Doc Watson
Play Columbus Stockade Blues
Forgive me all my anger
Forgive me all my faults
There's no need to forgive me
For thinkin' what I thought
I loved you from the git go
I'll love you till I die

6,Shameless,Garth Brooks,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/garth-brooks/shameless-chords-1453559,"Well, I'm shameless when it comes to loving you
I'll do anything you want me to, I'll do anything at all
And I'm standing, here for all the world to see
Oh, baby that's what's left of me, I don't have very far to fall
You know now I'm not a man who's ever been
Insecure about the world I've been living in
I don't break easy and I have my pride
But if you need to be satisfied
I'm shameless, honey I don't have a prayer
Every time I see you standing there I go down upon my knees
And I'm changing, swore I'd never compromise
Aw, but you convinced me otherwise, I'll do anything you please
You see in all my life I've never found
What I couldn't resist, what I couldn't turn down
I could walk away from anyone I ever knew
But I can't walk away from you
I have never let anything have this much control over me
I worked too hard to call my life my own
And I've made myself a world and it's worked so perfectly
But it's your world now, I can't refuse
I've never had so much to lose
Oh, I'm shameless
You know it should be easy for a man who's strong
To say he's sorry or admit when he's wrong
I never lost anything I ever missed
But I've never been in love like this    God it's out of my hands
I'm shameless, I don't have the power now
I don't want it anyhow so I've got to let it go

10,Love Me,Collin Raye,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/collin-raye/love-me-chords-914874,"I read a note my grandma wrote back in nineteen twenty-three.
Grandpa kept it in his coat, and he showed it once to me.     He said,
""Boy, you might not understand, but a long, long time ago,
Grandma's daddy didn't like me none, but I loved your Grandma so.""
We had this crazy plan to meet and run away together.
Get married in the first town we came to, and live forever.
But nailed to the tree where we were supposed to meet, instead
Of her, I found this letter, and this is what it said:
If you get there before I do, don't give up on me.
I'll meet you when my chores are through;
I don't know how long I'll be.
But I'm not gonna let you down, darling wait and see.
And between now and then, till I see you again,
I'll be loving you.  Love, me.
I read those words just hours before my Grandma passed away,
In the doorway of a church where me and Grandpa stopped to pray.
I know I'd never seen him cry in all my fifteen years;
But as he said these words to her, his eyes filled up with tears.
If you get there before I do, don't give up on me.
I'll meet you when my chores are through;
I don't know how long I'll be.
But I'm not gonna let you down, darling wait and see.
And between now and then, till I see you again,
I'll be loving you.  Love, me.

And I wrote your number on the fifty yard line
And you were always the perfect one and valedictorian
So, under your number I wrote ""Call for a good time""
I only wanted to get your attention but
You over looked me somehow
Besides you had too many boyfriends to mention and
I played my guitar too loud
How do ya like me now
How do ya like me now, now that I'm on my way
You still think I'm crazy standing here today
I couldn't make you love me but I always dreamed about
Living in your radio, How do ya like me now
When I took off to Tennessee I heard that you made fun of me
Never imagined I'd make it this far
Then you married into money girl, ain't it a cruel and funny world
He took your dreams, and he tore them apart
He never comes home and you're always alone and your
Kids hear you cry down the hall
Alarm clock starts ringing who could that be singing it's
Me baby with your wake up call

And the first thing that you want
Will be the last thing you ever need

I know it's been awhile since I talked to you

Many times I thought I'd call
Didn't have your number in my hand

It just reminds us of the cost

Something always seemed to turn out wrong
Never could catch up to you,

To hear the west wind whistle to the east

  When you yourself was just a hay-seed plowboy

You will never leave Harlan alive

And he asked Tillie Helton to be his bride
Said, won’t you walk with me 
out of the mouth of this holler
Or we’ll never leave Harlan alive
Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning
And the sun goes down about three in the day
And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you’re drinkin’
And you spend your life just thinkin’ of how to get away
No one ever knew there was coal in them mountains
‘Til a man from the Northeast arrived
Waving hundred dollar bills said, I’ll pay you for your minerals
But he never left Harlan alive
Granny sold out cheap and they moved out west of Pineville
To a farm where big Richland River winds
I bet they danced them a jig, laughed and sang a new song
Who said we’d never leave Harlan alive
But the times they got hard and tobacco wasn’t selling
And ole granddad knew what he’d do to survive
He went and dug for Harlan coal and sent the money back to granny
But he never left Harlan alive
Where the sun comes up about ten in the morning

And you fill your cup with whatever bitter brew you’re drinkin’
And you spend your life just thinkin’ of how to get away

The Babe, the Son of Mary.
Why lies He in such mean estate,
Where ox and ass are feeding?

The silent Word is pleading.
Nails, spear shall pierce Him through,
The cross be borne for me, for you.
Hail, hail the Word made flesh,
The Babe, the Son of Mary.
So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh,
Come peasant, king to own Him;
The King of kings salvation brings,
Let loving hearts enthrone Him.

The virgin sings her lullaby.

Fightin' was against the rules and it didn't matter why

And he said, ""Let me tell you a secret about a father's love""

My wife and I ran into my old high school flame
And as I introduced them the past came back to me
And I couldn't help but think of the way things used to be
She was the one that I'd wanted for all times
And each night I'd spend prayin' that God would make her mine
And if he'd only grant me this wish I wished back then
I'd never ask for anything again
Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers
She wasn't quite the angel that I remembered in my dreams
And I could tell that time had changed me
In her eyes too it seemed
We tried to talk about the old days
There wasn't much we could recall
I guess the Lord knows what he's doin' after all
And as she walked away I looked at my wife
And then and there I thanked the good Lord
For the gifts in my life
Sometimes I thank God for unanswered prayers
Remember when you're talkin' to the man upstairs
That just because he doesn't answer doesn't mean he don't care
Some of God's greatest gifts are unanswered prayers
Some of God's greatest gifts are all too often unanswered...

Broken and smokin' where the infrared deer plunge in the digital snake
I tell you, they make it so you can't shake hands when they make your hands shake
I know you like to line dance
Everything so democratic and cool
But, baby, there's no guidance when random rules
I know that a lot of what I say has been lifted off of men's room walls
Maybe I've crossed the wrong rivers and walked down all the wrong halls
But nothing can change the fact that we used to share a bed
And that's why it scared me so when you turned to me and said:
""Yeah, you look like someone
Yeah, you look like someone who up and left me low
Boy, you look like someone I used to know""
I know you'd like to line dance

He said, ""Steve, it's because people leave
And no highway will bring them back""

But before I go, I've gotta ask you, dear, about that tan line on your ring finger

  Larger than life again, holding me tight again
  Placing those same kisses on my brow
  Sweeter than ever now Lord I remember how
   Couldn't get enough of kissing    Do you know how much you're missing
No you don't, but I do
Days like a slow train  trickle by
Even the words that I write refuse to fly
All that I can hear is your song haunting me
Can't get the melody    out of my head, you see
  Distractions I've been using  do you know how much you're losing
No you don't, but I do
But I do, and I wonder if I'm past the point of rescue
Is no word from you at all the best that you can do

No you don't, but I do
I swore I'd never fall like this again
Fools like me never win,   came to my knees again
Can't close the door on the likelihood
Things might be just as good,   always believed they would
   Got to let your love invite me  baby do you think it might be
No you don't, but I do
But I do, and I wonder if I'm past the point of rescue
Is no word from you at all the best that you can do
  I never meant to push or shove you  do you know how much I love you

On a bed of California stars
I'd like to lay my weary bones tonight
On a bed of California stars
I'd love to feel your hand touching mine
And tell me why I must keep working on
Yes, i'd give my life to la my head tonight
On a bed of California stars
I'd like to dream my troubles are away
On a bed of California stars
Jump up from a starbed and make another day
Underneath my California stars
They hang like grapes on vines that shine
And warm the lovers glass like friendly wine
So, I'd give this world just to dream a dream with you
On our bed of California stars

I got a big chain around my neck
And I'm broken down like a train wreck
Well it's over I know it but I can't let go
See I got a candle and it burns so bright
Well it's over I know but I can't let go

The one who said that she'd rather roam
The one who said she'd rather be alone
If I could only see you now.
If I could hold you now
Just for a while just to really make you mine
Just for a while turn back the hands of time
If I could only hold you now
I've been too long in the wind,too long in the rain
Taking any comfort that I can
Looking back and longing for the freedom of my chains
Lying in your loving arms again.
If you could hear me now
Singing somewhere through the lonely nights
Dreaming of the arms that held me tight
If you could only hear me now.
I've been too long in the wind,too long in the rain
Taking any comfort that I can
Looking back and longing for the freedom of my chains
Lying in your loving arms again.
I can almost feel your loving arms again.

47,Mandolin Rain (ver 2),Bruce Hornsby,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bruce-hornsby/mandolin-rain-chords-1049600,"The song came and went,
like the times that we spent,
hiding out from the rain under the carnival tent
Happen she d smile,
it would last for awhile,
you don't know what you got, till you lose it all again
Listen to the mandolin rain,
listen to the music on the lake;
listen to my heart break, every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind,
a sad song drifting low,
listen to the tears roll, down my face as she turns to go 
A cool evening dance,
listening to the bluegrass band takes the chill
from the air, till they play the last song
I'll do my time, 
keeping you off my mind;
but there's moments that I find, I'm not feeling too strong 
Listen to the mandolin rain,
listen to the music on the lake;
listen to my heart break, every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind,
a sad song drifting low,
listen to the tears roll, down my face as she turns to go 
Running down by the lakeshore,
she did love the sound of a summer storm
Playing on the lake like a mandolin,
now it's washing her away once again
The boat's steaming in,
I watch the side wheel spin, and 
I think about her when I hear the whistle blow
I can't change my mind,
I knew all the time that she'd go;
but that's a choice I made long ago
Listen to the mandolin rain,
listen to the music on the lake;
listen to my heart break every time she runs away
Listen to the banjo wind,
a sad song drifting low;
listen to the tears roll, down my face as she turns to go 
As she turns to go 
Listen to, listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the tears roll, down my face as she turns to go
Listen to the tears roll, down my face as she turns to go 
Listen to, listen to the mandolin rain

But the ties of kinship I have not known them
I know no mother no father
No sister no brother

But when He calls me I will be able
To meet my family at God's table
I'll meet my mother my father

No more an orphan girl
Blessed Savior make me willing
And walk beside me until I'm with them
Be my mother my father

On the Corpus Christi Bay
I'd get off and drink 'til daylight
Sleep the mornin' away
I had a plan to take my wages
Leave the rigs behind for good
But that life it is contagious
And it gets down in your blood
I lived in Corpus with my brother
We were always on the run
We were bad for one another
But we were good at having fun
We got stoned along the seawall
We got drunk and rolled a car
We knew the girls at every dancehall
Had a tab at every bar
If I could live my life all over
It wouldn't matter anyway
'Cause I never could stay sober
On the Corpus Christi Bay
My brother had a wife and family
You know he gave 'em a good home
But his wife thought we were crazy
And one day we found her gone
We threw her clothes into the car trunk
Her photographs, her rosary
We went to the pier and got drunk
And threw it all into the sea
If I could live my life all over
It wouldn't matter anyway
'Cause I never could stay sober
On the Corpus Christi Bay
Now my brother lives in Houston
He married for the second time
He got a job with the union
And it's keeping him in line
He came to Corpus just this weekend
It was good to see him here
He said he finally gave up drinkin'
Then he ordered me a beer
If I could live my life all over
It wouldn't matter anyway
'Cause I never could stay sober
On the Corpus Christi Bay
If I could live my life all over
It wouldn't matter anyway
'Cause I never could stay sober

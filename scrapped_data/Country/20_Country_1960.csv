0,For Me This Is Happy,Gene Pitney,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/gene-pitney/for-me-this-is-happy-chords-1940607,"People think I'm a sight to see, the way 
that I look today.
But they should have seen the way I looked
when you first walked away.
I may still cry, it's true, but then what's 
Compared to what I used to be, for me, this 
is happy.
I've forgotten as much of you as I can forget.
And I've gotten over you as much as I can ever 
get.
And if I still look sad, well, for me that's not 
It's the best I'll ever be, so, for me, this is 
happy.
You're gone and I accept it and there's nothing I 
I've gotta learn to live with pain if I can't live 
Yes, to me happiness means I hurt a little less, to 
you it may seem like misery but, for me, this is 
happy.
To you it may seem like misery, but, for me, this 
is happy.

Silently for me.....

lives the girl I love so well
She left me for another

As I try to fit my life 
in a different mode I find
That love is a lonesome river
running through a lonesome mind
was just a child that played
Time sure changed this old town 
oh it's not the same today
As I try to meet old friends 
none do I find
Cause love is a lonesome river
running through a lonesome mind
that are overgrown with pines
There's pools along this river
where the sun will never shine
As I look into my heart 
and count my loss I find
That love is a lonesome river
running through a lonesome mind
Yes love is a lonesome river 
running through the lonesome mind

Clyde Barrow was the rounder that took her away

The poems that she wrote of the life that they led
Told of the lawmen left dying or dead
Now some say that Clyde made her life a shame
But the legend made Bonnie the head of the gang
Their rampage grew wilder with each passing day
Their odds growing smaller with each get-a-way
The end getting closer the harder they fought
With blood on their hands they were bound to get caught
They drove back from town on one bright summer day
When a man they befriended stepped out in the way
With no thought of dying they pulled to the side
But death lay there waiting for Bonnie & Clyde
Now two years of running was ended that day
For robbin' and killin' they both had to pay
We'll always remember how they lived an died
So goes the Legend of Bonnie & Clyde

As I recall the love you gave to me

Hidden deep within your eyes
Were daffodils and summer skies
Where meadow larks and butterflies would play
Sometimes when the night is still
I kiss the breeze and almost feel
Your sweet lips pressed against me tenderly
Soft and warm within my memory
Where do all the flowers go
When summer's covered up with snow
I guess the winter wind calls out their name
You were like the summer flower
And Love was just a fleeting hour
And all I have are dreams to comfort me
Soft and warm within my memory
Now the winter laughs at me
And asks me where I'm gonna be
If you don't bring the spring time back again
I'll be running through the snow
Searching for a winter rose
To press between the dreams you left with me
Soft and warm within my memory.
Soft and warm within my memory
Soft and warm within my memory..

From the bottle that she's just drank dry
In her mind there's a burning  it took a long time but she's learning
And just look at the teardrops she's cried
Everybody knows I love her but her mind is on another
And just look what he's done to her pride
And if she should change her mind give up the music and the wine
I'll be standing by to be the next in line
Just as long as she can hear the jukebox play
So I'll keep playing it loud I'll spend every dime I have
To keep her happy in my own kind of way

40,The Cowboy In The Continental Suit,Marty Robbins,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/marty-robbins/the-cowboy-in-the-continental-suit-chords-1802136,"Well he walks out in the arena all dressed up to the brim
Said he'd just came down from a place called Highland Rim
Well he said he came to ride the horse the one they called ""The Brute""
But he didn't look like a cowboy in his Continental Suit
We snickered at the way he dressed but he never said a word
He walks on by the rest of us as if he hadn't heard
A thousand bucks went to the man that could ride this wild Cayuse
A meaner horse was never born than the one they called ""The Brute""
The horse that he was looking for was in chute number eight
He walked up very slowly put his hand upon the gate
We knew he was a thoroughbred when he pulled a sack of Dukes
From the inside pocket of his Continental Suit
He rolled himself a quirley and he lit it standing there
He blew himself a smoke ring and he watched it disappear
We thought he must be crazy when he opened up the gate
Standing just inside was fifteen hundred pounds of the hate
The buckskin tried to run him down but the stranger was too quick
He stepped aside and threw his arms around the horse's neck
And he pulled himself upon the back of the horse they called ""The Brute""
Sat like he was born there in his continental suit
""The Brute's"" hind end was in the air his front end on the ground
Kicking and a-squealing trying to shake the stranger down 
But the stranger didn't give an inch, he came to ride ""The Brute""
And he came to ride the buckskin in a Continental Suit
Well I turned around to look at Jim and he was watching me 
He said I don't believe the crazy things I think I see
But I think I see the outlaw the one they call ""The Brute""
Ridden by a cowboy in a Continental Suit
""The Brute"" came to a standstill ashamed that he'd bin rode 
By a city cowboy in some continental clothes
The stranger took his money and we don't know where he went
We don't know where he came from and we haven't seen him since
The moral of the story never judge by what they wear 
Underneath some ragged clothes could be a millionaire
Everybody listen  don't be fooled by this galoot
The sure enough bronc buster in a Continental Suit

  And paste in some new ones - far better and true

  I searched through the chapters - referring to hearts
  For the one with the caption - ""Till death do us part""
  I ripped at each letter - and I tore at each word
  I screamed at your memory - and nobody heard
  Nobody heard
  But your memory's determined - and chances are few
  Of my ever finding - a replacement for you
  It desperately clings to the floor of my mind
  And fights for its place in the pages of time

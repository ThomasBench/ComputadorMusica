1,Put Your Hand In The Hand,Anne Murray,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/anne-murray/put-your-hand-in-the-hand-chords-1842959,"Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the waters
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself and you can look at the others differently
By putting your hand in the hand of the man from Gal-ilee
Every time I look into the Holy Book I wanna tremble
When I read about the part where a carpenter cleared the temple
For the buyers and the sellers were no different Fellers than what I profess to be
And it causes me shame to know I'm not the gal that I should be
Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the waters
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself and you can look at the others differently
By putting your hand in the hand of the man from Gal-ilee
Mama taught me how to pray before I reached the age of seven
And when I'm down on my knees that's when I'm close to heaven
Daddy lived his life for eight kids and wife you do what you must do
But he showed me enough of what it takes to get you through
Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the waters
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself and you can look at the others differently
By putting your hand in the hand of the man from Gal-ilee
Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the waters
Put your hand in the hand of the man who calmed the sea
Take a look at yourself and you can look at the others differently

And she sweeter than saccharin at a drug store sale

16,The Ballad Of Bill Thaxton,Marty Robbins,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/marty-robbins/the-ballad-of-bill-thaxton-chords-1900845,"Bill Thaxton was an ex-Ranger
One of the bravest by far
It's said that old Bill was the fastest man ever
To pin on a Ranger's star
Stories about him were legend
Bill was the best of the bold
Bad men all feared him way back in his day
But he was now growing old
Into Bill's town rode an outlaw
He wore his gun low and tied down
He reined in his horse and announced to the crowd
""If you speak to me call me Sundown""
His clothes were all dark and fancy
And topped by a black leather vest
Somebody asked how he came by his name
And if he was one of the best.
        The eyes of the tall stranger narrowed
He grinned like the devil possessed
""I never fight till the sun's going down
And my back is facing the We--------st""
Said he wouldn't be with us tomorrow
He only rode in for one thing
He only stopped by to make Bill Thaxton die
So he could add to his fame.
""Go give Bill Thaxton a message
And tell him a killer's in town
Tell him we'll meet at the end of the street
Just as the sun's going down""
Somebody said it had been years
Since old Bill had toted a gun
Sundown replied that it wasn't his hide
Killing old Bill would be fun
The old Ranger sent back his answer
""Tell him that I'm on my way
I've never ran and I'll meet this young man
At any time of the day""
         Bill got there just about sunset
It still hung like fire in the sky
In just a few moments out there in the street
Old Bill or the outlaw would die----------
Slowly Bill slid from the saddle
And started to make his advance
The sun hit the old Ranger square in the eyes
The shadows had started to dance
Bill started talking to Sundown
Judging his distance that way
Their stride was the same and at just thirty feet
Both of the men made their play
Bill's gun slipped leather like lightning
His forty-four spoke with a whine
The sun didn't bother Bill Thaxton at all
Cause the old ranger was blind
Six shots delivered their message
The Ranger had emptied his gun
Old Bill gave a sigh when there was no reply
He knew that once more he had won
         The old Ranger lowered his six gun
He just stood there staring ahead
Watching you'd think that old Bill didn't know
In front of him Sundown lay dea-------d
Bill has been gone for a long time
But old timers still can recall
The day the old Ranger stood up to the test
And proved he was best of them all.

Through the ranges and gorges to the great nickel mine
The long days are dusty and hotter than hell
And that's why we all worship Three Rivers Hotel
It's Theiss Brothers camp on the banks of the Star
Where men from all nations and walks of life are
And it's funny to listen to the stories they tell
Every night round the bar in Three Rivers Hotel
We curse at the things that go wrong through the day
And vow that we'll snatch it go far away
But when day is done and we're soon feeling well
And laughter rings out from Three Rivers Hotel
There's Wesley the barman and young irish Joe
Serving the booze and collecting the dough
What a stir they would cause if they ever should tell
All the secrets they've learned in Three Rivers Hotel
On the night after pay day there's fun and romance
It's a night for the families to sing and to dance
You can let down your hair and come out of your shell
And do your own thing in Three Rivers Hotel
And if you listen to the bosses when the night's getting late
On the progress they're making the best in the state
They'd be finished this line and this maintenance as well
If they worked like they bragged in Three Rivers Hotel
And if you think you can drink we've got money to back
On stayers like Cass and old grader Jack
And they tell me old Coster gives everyone hell
When he gets on the booze in Three Rivers Hotel (Yeah he's a whopper)
When this job is finished we'll pack up and go
To another construction still chasing big dough
But where ever I wander my memory will dwell
On those happy days in Three Rivers Hotel

By the campfire at night where the wild dingoes call
But there's nothin' so lonesome, morbid or drear
Than to stand in the bar of a pub with no beer
Now the publican's anxious for the quota to come
There's a faraway look on the face of the bum
The maid's gone all cranky and the cook's acting queer
What a terrible place is a pub with no beer
The stockman rides up with his dry, dusty throat
He breasts up to the bar, pulls a wad from his coat
But the smile on his face quickly turns to a sneer
When the barman says sadly, 'The pub's got no beer'
Then in comes the swagman, all covered with flies
He throws down his roll, wipes the sweat from his eyes
But when he is told he says, 'What's this I hear?
I've trudged fifty flamin' miles to a pub with no beer!'
There's a dog on the v'randah, for his master he waits
But the boss is inside drinking wine with his mates
He hurries for cover and he cringes in fear
It's no place for a dog round a pub with no beer
Old Billy, the blacksmith, the first time in his life
Has gone home cold sober to his darling wife
He walks in the kitchen; she says: ""You're early, my dear""
Then he breaks down and he tells her that the pub's got no beer
So it's lonesome away from your kindred and all
By the campfire at night where the wild dingoes call
But there's nothin' so lonesome, morbid or drear
Than to stand in the bar of a pub with no beer

the promise of another sunny day.
And all the flowers open up to gather in the sunshine, 
I do believe that summer's here to stay.
Do you care what's happening around you? Do your senses know the changes when they come? 
Can you feel yourself reflected in the seasons? Do you understand the need to carry on? 
Riding on the tapestry of all there is to see, 
so many ways and oh, so many things.
Rejoicing in the differences, there's no one just like me.
Yet as different as we are, we're still the same.
And oh, I love the life within me, I feel a part of everything I see.

Let me hear that lonesome sound
For it blends with the feeling that's in me
The one I loved has turned me down
I'm gonna catch me a freight train
Lord I'm leaving this lonesome town
The one I loved and gave my heart to
For someone else she turned me down
Engineer reach up and pull the whistle
Let me hear that lonesome sound
For it blends with the feeling that's in me
The one I loved has turned me down
There's sixteen cars behind each engine
I'll ride the last one till the end of the line
I don't know where I'll go or where I'll wind up
Just anything to ease my worried mind
Engineer reach up and pull the whistle
Let me hear that lonesome sound
For it blends with the feeling that's in me
The one I loved has turned me down

47,Faster Horses The Cowboy And The Poet,Tom T. Hall,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tom-t-hall/faster-horses-the-cowboy-and-the-poet-chords-1739452,"He was an old-time cowboy, don't you understand?
His eyes were sharp as razor blades, his face was leather-tanned
His toes were pointed inwards from a-hangin' on a horse
He was an old philosopher, of course
He was so thin I swear you coulda used him for a whip
He had to drink a beer to keep his britches on his hips
I knew I had to ask him about the mysteries of life
He spit between his boots and he replied,
""It's faster horses, younger women, older whiskey, and more money!""
He smiled and all his teeth were covered with tobacco stains
He said, ""It don't do men no good to pray for peace and rain
Peace and rain is just a way to say prosperity
And buffalo chips is all it means to me.""
I told him I was a poet; I was lookin' for the truth
I said I was a writer; my soul was all on fire
He looked at me and he said, ""You are a liar.  Son,
It's faster horses, younger women, older whiskey, and more money!""
Well, I was disillusioned, if I say the least
There was something cold and shiny layin' by my head
So I started to believe the things he said.
Well, my poet days are over, and I'm back to bein' me
If my boy ever asks me what it is that I have learned
I think that I will readily affirm,  ""Son,
It's faster horses, younger women, older whiskey, and more money!""
""It's faster horses, younger women, older whiskey, and more money!""
""It's faster horses, younger women, older whiskey, and more money!""
""It's faster horses, younger women, older whiskey, and more money!""

 And the pill lit on the pillow amongst the wine bottles and the cheese
 Took a Polaroid picture that was naughty and it slipped yes it did
 And just when they thought it couldn't get no better then it did
 Just when you think it can't get no better then it does
 It's always so much better than it ever was
 Seems like all the good things come at once,     yes they do
 And just when you think it can't get no better then it does
 Well they knew what they liked they ain't neither one of them naive
 She said I'll probably get in trouble but this time I don't care
 Well I should go to work but I'd rather be with you instead
 And just when they thought it couldn't get no better then it did
 Just when you think it can't get no better then it does

 She taught school and he played the five string banjo
 She lived here in town and he traveled the whole world wide
 Well she packed the lunch brought the wine he drove the car and scored a lid

 And just when you think it can't get no better then it does
 It was a perfect day for a dalliance and a picnic
 And a riverbank was an excellent place to love
 Well the sun was a shining and the birds were a singing overhead  (whistles)

And fellas, I know you're ready to rock
We went crazy, cooped up all winter long
And school is out so let's get it on
Flip flop tan and some white sand I know the perfect spot
Well, the sunset better set soon so we can get in the mood

Let that igloo cooler mark your piece of paradise
Summer nights everybody's feeling sexy 
Holler if you're ready for summer nights, come on yeah
Now fellas, you better watch your step
Don't let those teeny French bikinis make you lose your breath 
Back to the ladies y'all keep doing y'alls thing
Cause everything about you makes me wanna scream

I bet you didn’t know under that live oak

From Better Homes and Gardens magazine

Nail by nail and board by board

Bearing the burden of a secret storm
Sometimes she wishes she was never born

In a world that she can't rise above

The neighbors hear, but they turn out the lights
A fragile soul caught in the hands of fate
When morning comes it'll be too late

An angel girl with an upturned face
A name is written on a polished rock
A broken heart that the world forgot

In a world that she can't rise above

Tripped upon the land until enough was enough

29,The Guitar,Guy Clark,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/guy-clark/the-guitar-chords-1990985,"Well, I was passing by a pawn shop
In an older part of town
Somethin' caught my eye
And I stopped and turned around
I stepped inside an' there I spied
In the middle of it all
Was a beat up old guitar
Hangin' on the wall.
""What do you want for that piece of junk?""
I asked the old man
He just smiled and took it down
And he put it in my hand
He said, ""You tell me what it's worth
You're the one who wants it
Turn it up, play a song
And let's just see what haunts it.""
So I hit a couple of cords
In my old country way of strumming
And then my fingers turned to lightnin'
Man, I never heard it comin'
It was like I always knew it
I just don't know where I learned it
It wadn't nothin' but the truth
So I just reared back and burned it
Well, I lost all track of time
There was nothing I couldn't pick
Up and down the neck
Man.. I never missed a lick
The guitar almost played itself
There was nothing I could do
It was getting hard to tell
Just who was playing who
When I finally put it down
I couldn't catch my breath
My hands were shakin'
And I was scared to death
The old man finally got up
Said, ""where in the Hell you been?
I've been waiting all these years
For you to stumble in""
Then he took down an old dusty case
Said, ""go on and pack it up,
You don't owe me nothing""
And then he said, ""good luck""
There was somethin' spooky in his voice
And somethin' strange on his face
When he shut the lid
I saw my name was on the case

Little more right now, a little less what's next

And he was wrinkled from grinnin’
From all of the sun he had been in
He was barefoot, cerveza in hand
He said “Gracias senor”, when I paid him too much for
All of the Snapper he had
Now I told him my friend it ain’t nothin’
In the best broken Spanish I knew 
I said I make a good livin’
Back home where I’m from
He smiled and said Amigo me too 
He said I fish and I play my guitar
I laugh at the bar with my friends
I go home to my wife 
I pray every night
I can do it all over again
Somewhere over Texas 
I thought of my Lexus
And all the stuff I work so hard for
And all the things that I’ve gathered
From climbing that ladder
Didn’t make much sense anymore 
They say my nest egg ain’t ready to hatch yet
They keep holding my feet to the fire 
They call it paying the price
So that one day in life 
I’ll have what I need to retire 
And just fish, and play my guitar,
Laugh at the bar with my friends,
Go home to my wife 
And pray every night,
I can do it all over again

When the truth is I’m really just dying

Play my guitar

And all the girls are getting pretty, sprayin' on the White Rain
Yeah, they're gonna get a rowdy tonight
Down at the football game, yeah
We let it rip
when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
It gets wild, yeah, but that's the way
Well, you can see the neighbors butt crack nailing on his shingles
And his woman's smokin', Pall Mall's watchin' Laura Ingalls
And granny's getting lit, she's headin' out to bingo
Yeah, my buddies and me are goin' muddin'
We let it rip
when we got the money
Let it roll if we got the gas
It gets wild, yeah, but that's the way
We hear folks in the city party in Martini Bars
And they like to show off in their fancy foreign cars
Out here in the boondocks we buy beer at Amoco
And crank our Kraco speakers with that country radio
We let it rip

Let it roll if we got the gas
It gets wild, yeah, but that's the way

She picked me up on Friday
I just laughed and lit a cigarette
Life's gotten simple since
Happy and sad and back again
Think about you all the time
Think about you lying there
Nothing breathes here in the cold
I've been thinking some of suicide
I think the thing you said was true
The wind's feeling real these days
think that I've fallen out of love 
think I've fallen out of love 
I think I've fallen out of love 
With you

Things I've been dying to tell you
The best or the worst things that you
Never needed to know
This is the kind of comedy where no one's
Laughing 'cause it's hard to...
I'm a punch line who's punch-drunk with my
Fist in a broken mirror...
There's a party near by
 I can hear
Laughter in the distance and it all comes clear
Sounds too simple, but love is the only answer
Everything else is just a train-wreck
Gonna stay up all night every night for the rest of my life
Till the lines around my eyes grow deeper and more defined
You might ask me ""Aren't you dead inside and so damn tired?""
I say i have no idea but I'm not sleeping until after the
dying is over I can hear
Laughter in the distance and it all comes clear
Sounds too simple, but love is the only answer
Love's a trainwreck, you're a mistake

47,The Funeral,Turnpike Troubadours,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/turnpike-troubadours/the-funeral-chords-1395587,"Well now stage right enter Jimmy, just a counterfeit James Dean
with a pocket full of delta blues and cheap amphetamine
Her feet up on the dashboard like a burned out Betty Paige
Aw she might have been pretty if she was half her age
But together they were something, just closing down the bars
Headed down from Okie City in a slightly stolen car
The folks were decent people, they didn't like their kind
When the car pulled in the driveway the were staring through the blinds
The preacher in the kitchen, he's eatin' apple pie
Oh momma's in the bedroom she couldn't help but cry
Oh and daddy looked so natural like he'd just gone to sleep
And the preacher looked through Jimmy and prayed his soul to keep
It's coming home, coming home
Ain't nothing like a family to make you feel so damned alone
You should've brought flowers, should've got daddy's gun
Aint nobody waiting on the prodigal son
Well they pulled out into traffic, moved in behind the hearse
And that awful empty feeling, well it went from bad to worse
The preacher read some scripture and they put him in the ground
Aw then everybody loaded up and headed back to town
But Jimmy got his whiskey out once everyone was gone
He felt he should've said something staring down at the stone
It's coming home, coming home
Ain't nothing like a family to make you feel so damned alone
You should've brought flowers, should've got daddy's gun
Ain't nobody waiting on the prodigal son
Well the menfolk folded tables and the ladies cleaned the plates
And the cousins asked about the car locked behind the gate
Jimmy knew his daddy's .38, was in that trunk buried deep
And it would find its rightful owner once his momma was asleep.
And Jimmy looked at momma, momma just looked down
She said why's it take a funeral, boy to bring you back to town

Katie was the girl down the street
Well I took her to a dance on the Fourth of July
Hopin' she might fall in love with me
Well the band started playing right at nine
Firecrackers popped in the sky
We danced and we danced
Lord I never had a chance
I got canned on the 5th of July
And we laughed at the moonlight
Said goodbye in the grey light of dawn
Yes the girl of my dreams each and every night it seems
Is the one that I hold in my arms
I was playin' in the Tommy Knocker Tavern
Jenny was the girl at the bar
Well I sang every song for her and her alone
And kissed her 'neath the Colorado stars
And we laughed at the moonlight
Said goodbye in the grey light of dawn
Yes the girl of my dreams each and every night it seems
Is the one that I hold in my arms
Seasons come and change just like the leaves
Red oaks in the Kai Nation wind
Well they scatter and they fall
Where they land I can't recall
Will I ever find my darlin' again

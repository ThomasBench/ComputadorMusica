And say they've got me on their minds
The trapeze artists are in full swing
Doing all their favorite things

Sure beats lying in my grave

Tennessee Special all the way
Emerald City, diamond eyes
Cloak and dagger in disguise
The city living, it's not for me
And don't you agree?
Woah, woah, won't you agree?
Of course you do
Silly me
I'm already on that Tennessee Special
Sure beats lying in my grave
I'll take the money, but these fools don't own me

I'm already on that Tennessee Special
Sure beats lying in my grave
I love you, honey, but you just don't know me

And surrendered to the white man hot on his heels

Without peace in the valley down below

East Arizona was his pride and keep
Down through the Pecos, they tried to take him down
'Til an hour from the border, he stopped and turned around
He cried ""Peace in the valley!"", lay down his shield

No matter how much he might disagree
I suddenly I saw it in his eyes when it clicked
The last thing he was gonna see was me
And fear is such a funny thing
We wear it like a diamond ring
With promises we never plan to keep
I swear that if you let me go and so and so but tears are only water
And water is cheap
Mirror mirror on the counter, covered in fine white powder
What the hell is fair at all?
So I'll take a drop for every hour shе'll never dance
Hidе a piece in every city she'll never see
I know that this won't make it better
But I don't want to live without her
So the last drop, the last drop is for me
I never thought there'd be a day I didn't get to hold my daughter
Terrified knowing that I'd never come to terms with this at all
I never knew how much a man could hate until I read that letter
And like you said, none of us are saints, if I recall
I never knew how patient I could be until I watched you bleed
There's nothing I can take from you that means what she did to me
Every word from your fucking mouth
Is like bringing wood to a burning house
And we'll be here all night 'til ashes are all we breathe
So I'll take a drop for every hour shе'll never dance

Somebody done somebody wrong
All that remains of a memory
Now lives forever in a song
They took a million broken pieces
To fill an empty page with lines
They find a few to string together
And find a way to make 'em rhyme
And every hour on the hour
It plays on my radio
And one thing leads to another
Then another and another one
I don't mind a steady backbeat
Or a crying steel guitar
But you can keep your shot of whiskey
And who wants another broken heart?

Scarеd to death to touch the dial
For fear of bringing back a memory
Damn near every country mile
But every hour on the hour
It plays on my radio

But I don't need to hear the tale

Of someone walkin' out the door

About a man born in Hard Burly back in June of '29
Must've got that Martin Meylin muzzle the day he was born
Things he could do with that rifle
Blow the balls off a bat, reload and shoot it one more time
Had an monster of a mule, was a mighty fine steed
Sham, and Sam, that tomahawk, and that Flintlocks all he need
Finding food and finding trouble and always takin' heed
And any man that crossed him was surely gonna bleed
And he'd stretch you up and burn you for callin' him half breed
Left the varnish off his words, feared no beast nor man
Didn't wanna end up in his debt 'cause it'd damn sure get paid
He was harder than the nails hammered Jesus' hands
He was the one they called Dood
Son of a mountain miner and a Shawnee maiden
Wore a size 17 ring, had hands like a bear
And if he got 'em on ya, he's takin' that top hair
His Grandfather taught him how to hunt and how to live off the land
Taught him how to take a scalp when you kill a man
He was a deadly warrin' daddy with a gun gleam in his eye
Till he found him a good woman that calmed down the rage
He built a home from the land with the hands the good Lord gave him
And ol' Dood got his own food
Had no need for the script that ol' coal company paid
Left the varnish off his words, feared no beast nor man
And if either came upon him, they'd damn sure get slayed
He was harder than the nails hammered Jesus' hands
He was the one they called Dood

And every bad decision, now also theirs to make
The thief that only borrows in a sea without the shark
But who protects the shadow from the dark?
A thousand different angles say the circles name in vain
Are we crucifying the savior or a masochist in pain
The knife without the handle, a shark without the sea
But who will give the shadow everything it needs?
And every rule we follow was also made to brеak
And everything we lеt go, there's something else we take
A goal without ambition is a key without the lock
And who is there to listen when the shadow has to talk?
The time we take to wonder the point of being alive
The small talk we depend on like drinking piss to survive
The daughter of the addict wears her wedding dress to prom
And no one cares to find out where the shadow's coming from
The old interpretations of how everyone should look
The cold and spiteful rhetoric inspired by a book
And hate without tradition is Noah without the ark
And who protects the shadow from the dark?
Only feeling alone around people
Getting by, making it believable
Love without compassion is fire without a spark
But who protects the shadow, better than the dark?

I ain't known you that long to begin with
Leave the rocks in the road, stay away from the river, Virginia
There's not much you can do 'cept wait on a train
When the road gullies out in a Biblical rain
And that's how it's been ever since I can remember
I'm not too keen of mind
I don't pick up on signs like I ought to
So I won't sweat the cost
Of the coffee or the wine that I bought you
With your emptied out nest, your chicks have all flew
There's nobody left to take care of but you
And you don't know how to just be
No one ever taught you
And I can't find much to say
As you play with that loose strand of hair
If you had you a tail you'd be twitching it
And I'vе got to get over the scarе
And tell you no
And tell you no
And tell you no
Tell you no
Never saw such a cold day in June did you ever, Virginia?
In our young days the old people called it 'Blackberry Winter'
As the mail plane goes out at a slow rate of climb
This cold rain don't help with your low state of mind
Hanging down like the fog on the ridge
You can't tell what's in it
And you stare me down hard
And you ask me why I even care
It's not that I'm any Sir Galahad
There just needs to be somebody there
To tell you no
To tell you no
To tell you no
To tell you no
Your bags are all packed, you're not coming back that's for certain
And the landlady won't like the stains on the rugs and the curtains
Well, that's just wear and tear such as happens in life
But folks around here live to gossip and gripe
So I won't tell a soul
What they'll never know'll never hurt 'em
And I found the letter you left at the foot of the stairs
And I heard the horn blow, the train's pulling out
I hope you find somebody there
To tell you no
To tell you no
To tell you no
To tell you no

I never had a fear and I never had a doubt
If it had a lick of sense I'd have figured that out pretty fast
But I wadn't any smarter than the average kid
Somebody mighta noticed, but I never did
I never saw the future fading right into the past
Talking to the wallpaper, wandering the halls
I burned a lot of bridges and I dropped a lot of balls
It's a wonder I can ever go back to any place I've been
But I wouldn't get down on my knees on a bet
I'm near enough to Jesus as I'd ever want to get
Seeking salvation ain't part of my general plan
Save your prayers for yourself
Raise my glass to your health
I don't mind if you don't look like me
I can share my bread and wine
I come from another time
It don't matter all that much if it don't bleed
If it don't bleed
Now it's all I can do to just get out of bed
There's more in the mirror than there is up ahead
I smile and I nod like I heard what you said every time
So run another rack, pour another shot
You don't get it back so give it all you got
While you still got a more or less functional body and mind
Save your prayers for yourself
Raise my glass to your health
I don't mind if you don't look like me
I can share my bread and wine
I come from another time
It don't matter all that much if it don't bleed
If it don't bleed
I learned to answer my calls and open my mail
I paid my taxes and I stayed out of jail
You stay in the game when you're too broke to fail
That's a fact
Talking to the wallpaper sleeping in the hall
Your bones get brittle so you better not fall
You slow to a crawl
Time gets to balling the jack
Run you right off the track
Save your prayers for yourself
Raise my glass to your health
I don't mind if it don't talk like me
I can share my bread and wine
I come from another time
It don't matter all that much if it don't bleed
If it don't bleed

Crying let me in
I see her dancing there in all her wonder
How her body moves with eternal youth
And her footsteps hammer on like rolling thunder
While I'm stuck here in the shadows
Fueling the dream
Another face just flashing in the night
The smoke it folds around me
Like unenchanted wings
As I listen to the nightbirds singing in their flight
Oh, close this great divide
Between my heart and mind
Once shе held me in my anguish
Pulled mе from my pain
And sheltered me from life's mysteries
Somewhere beyond the darkness
Lies incredible light
At least that’s what she once made me believe
So go dive in empty spaces
Where magic weaves and spins
Go find her there, it's where she set me free
Now I'm pulling chains from every corner of her memory
Go find her there and bring her back to me
Oh, close this great divide
Between my heart and mind
Just listen to the nightbirds
Listen to the nightbirds
Listen to the nightbirds
Listen to the nightbirds
Well, if I could turn my back now
And lay back down with you
I'd pull you in and finally get some sleep
Listening to the nightbirds
Without wondering how
They hold her in their song so casually

Helen was in the passenger seat eating melon and spitting out the seeds
Feeling happy to be alone but still turning a saxophone as cold as stone kinda like
She said this is what the apocalypse will look like
A tornado with human eyes
Poisoned birdbaths and torrents of chemical rain
Like the heads of state hyperventilating in clouds of methane
Sundown on the human heart
And this is what the apocalypse will sound like
But it will be loud as a mushroom cloud
It will sound like final jeopardy
But somehow be ghostly like a glockenspiel
Like the testing of bombs or the tapping of stiletto heels

He tried to make the distinction between death and extinction
They stopped off at a place called Hamburger Heaven to grab a bite to eat
But Helen had no appetite, she just drank a 7 Up
While the sheriff tapped his coffee cup to a distant beat
It won't look like those old frescoes, man I don't think so
There will be no angels with swords, man I don't think so
No jubilant beings in the sky above, man I don't think so
And it won't look like those old movies neither
There will be no drag racing through the bombed out streets neither
No shareholders will be orbiting the earth, man neither
It will be hard to recognize each other through our oxygen masks
The successful sons of businessmen will set their desks on fire
While five star generals of the free world weep in the oil-choked tide

As he drove through the principalities of unreality
On the run with somebody else's wife
The heiress of Texas oil
 What is freedom? He thought
 Is it to be empty of desire?
Is it to find everything I've lost or have been in search of?
Or is it to return to the things is which there is no more returning?

Beer from a bottle
Hiding in the corner of an old map dot
One man band playin' ""Black Water""
Knowing every truck in the parking lot
I can have a good time anywhere I go
But give me the neon that frees my soul
'Cause a hurt don't heal and a buzz don't feel
Like it does in the bars back home
If I'm gonna take me a Sunday drive
I'd rather it be at sundown
If I'm ever gonna settle down
It's only gonna be in one town
I'm always gonna be that good ol' boy
Blue jeans and a camouflage hat
But when it comes to a Friday night
And knocking one or two back

40,Secrets,Billy Strings,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/billy-strings/secrets-chords-3893354," It’s something cold like what I stuck around to fight through
And it gets feeling tougher every day
 I feel like everybody likes to run their mouth but
Can’t decide on what it is they’re tryin’ to say
 There’s nothing wrong with hearing voices
 Even when they’re in your dreams
 And if you’d listen in tomorrow could be better than it seems
 I used to think I couldn’t even count my blessings
But now I know they’re few and far between
 And when I look at my reflection in the mirror
I can see some man I’ve never even seen
 The wasted life I left behind me
 Was just a war I couldn’t win
 I’m the devil’s guest of honor that’s the best it’s ever been
Little said is soonest mended
Without a wing a word could fly a 1.000 miles
I’d rather be abandoned or alone
Just so I could lend my secrets to the wind
 I know a man whose pain is heavy like an anchor
And it drags him to the bottom of the sea
 His cloudy eyes are often lost behind a daydream
Or frozen in some broken memory
But I’ve never heard him speak about what happened
 He’ll never say what laid him low
 There are secrets that we carry that are ours to bare alone
 You said a love that’s kept in secret dies in darkness
And a soul needs to confess to be set free
 So I’m lifting back the cover of my heart, dear
And hoping that you’ll do the same for me
 It’s not too pretty, but it’s open
It’s the only way I know to tell you true
 I’d walk the world alone before I’d ever walk away from you
Little said is soonest mended
Without a wing a word could fly a 1.000 miles
I’d rather be abandoned or alone
Just so I could lend my secrets to the wind
If you can link your value to your wallet or a key chain
Or a locked wrought iron fence around your yard
Living check to check, a skinny tie around your neck
On stolen time and borrowed numbers off a card
 You blink and life is left behind you
 There’s no escape, that’s just a fact
We’re all a dollar short and every one of us is running out of track
Little said is soonest mended
Without a wing a word could fly a 1.000 miles
I’d rather be abandoned or alone
Just so I could lend my secrets to the wind
Little said is soonest mended
Without a wing a word could fly a 1.000 miles

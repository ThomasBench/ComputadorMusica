When an old friend I happened to see
I introduced her to my loved one
And while they were waltzin'
My friend stole my sweetheart from me
I remember that night and the Tennessee Waltz
Only you know just how much I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darlin' the night they were playin'
That beautiful Tennessee Waltz
Yes, I remember that night and the Tennessee Waltz
Only you know how much I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darlin' the night they were playin'

1,En Koskaan Mene Sänkyyn Ruman Naisen Kanssa,Freud Marx Engels & Jung,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/2199985,"Olen kulkenut noissa kaljakuppiloissa

Aina löytää erestään

Aina turhaan perännyt
Vaikken koskaan mene sänkyyn ruman naisen kanssa

Eiks oo kummaa kuinka likööri ja enkelikööri
Saa vaihtaa näkökulmaa mut
Vaikken koskaan mene sänkyyn ruman naisen kanssa
Niitten vieressä oon aamut
Ja kun pidellen päätäni vierestä näätäni
Herään, mietin mitä taas tein
Ja kuinka monta aamua odottaa mua
Samanlaisin haastein
Kun mä aloitan illan olen valikoiva
Kahden jälkeen mikä tahansa käy
Vaikken koskaan mene sänkyyn ruman naisen kanssa
Miksi aamuisin muita ei näy
Eiks oo kummaa kuinka likööri ja enkelikööri
Saa vaihtaa näkökulmaa mut
Vaikken koskaan mene sänkyyn ruman naisen kanssa
Niitten vieressä oon aamut
Ja mun ainoa aatteeni on, oonko vaatteeni
Kaikki jo kerännyt

Now I've been around Australia
And I've travelled everywhere
But there's one place I really like to go
Where the land is big and wide
And tall dark ringers ride
Where the old Moyle River flows
Tough riders there of course
In a truck or on a horse
And they'll really teach you things you didn't know
It's excitement to the full
If you're out there chasing bulls
Where the old Moyle River flows
And the Kangaroo still bounds
On that rough and rugged ground
The ant hills and the old pandanas grow
Yes and everyday's a Sunday
If you're catching Barramundi
By the plains of Peppimenarti
Where the old Moyle River flows
Yodel  Yodel
Now the men out on the stock camps
Are the finest riders known
And they'll work four weeks without a break or spell
They're the back bone of our beef steaks
And I've mentioned this before
Always proud to tell
May the march of time never
Ever bring to many changes
To a way of life you people love and prize
May the years ahead be good ones
And you never lose your customs
Looking down so old and wise

Draped in black while his widow screamed.

To show the folks a brand new way of life
But all you've shown the folks around here is trouble
And you've only added misery to their strife
Your concern is not to help the people
And I'll say again, though it's been often said
Your concern is just to bring discomfort, my friend
And your policy is just a little red
Now, ain't I right (ain't he right)
  (ain't he right)
It matters not to you how people suffer
And should they, you'd consider that a gain
You bring a lot of trouble to the town and then you leave
That's part of your Communistic game
I detect a little Communism
I can see it in the things you do
Communisim, socialism call it what you like
There's very little difference in the two
Now, ain't I right (ain't he right)
  (ain't he right)
Your followers sometimes have been a bearded, hatless bunch
There's even been a minister or two
A priest, a nun, a rabbi and an educated man
Have listened and been taken in by you
Aw, the country's full of two-faced politicians
Who encourage you with words that go like this
Burn your draft card if you like, it's good to disagree
That's a get acquainted Communistic kiss
Now, ain't I right (ain't he right)
  (ain't he right)
One politician said it would be nice to send some blood
And help the enemy in Vietnam
That's what he says, here's what I say
Let's just keep the blood
Instead let's send that politician man
Let's rid the country of the politicians,
Who call us tramps, that march out in our streets
Protesting those who wanna fight for freedom, my friend
This kind of leader makes our country weak
Now, ain't I right (ain't he right)
  (ain't he right)
Let's look and find the strong and able leaders
It's time we found just how our neighbours stand
If we're to win this war with Communism
Let's fight it here as well as Vietnam
Let's rise as one and meet our obligations
So Communistic boots will never trod
Across the fields of freedom that were given to us
With the blessing of our great almighty God
Across the fields of freedom that were given to us
With the blessing of our great almighty God

I drove around the block till I was dizzy

And then I saw our bottle there beside me

Just get you on by me keep out of my way
Just a little hard thinking might drive me to drinking

In the land of the buffalo
And the auctioneers gavel, how it rapped and it rattled
As I watched the old Double Diamond go
Won't you listen to the wind
Mother Nature's violin
When I first hired on the Old Double Diamond
I was a dammed poor excuse for a man
I never learned how to aim when the spirit was tame
Couldn't see all the cards in my hand
And the wind whipped the granite above me
Blew the tumble weeds clean through my soul
Well I fought her winters and I busted her horses
And I took more than I thought I could stand
But the battles with mountains and cattle
Seemed to bring out the best in a man
I guess a sailor, he needs an ocean
And a mama, her babies to hold
I need the hills of Wyoming
In the land of the buffalo
Now she's sellin' out, I'm moving on
But I'm leavin' with more than I came
Cause I've got this saddle, and it ain't for sale
And I got this song to sing
Find a new range to ride, new knots to tie
In a country where cowboys are king
I turn my tail to the wind and the old Double Diamond
Disappeared into the sage

You can search the world for pretty girls 'til your eyes are weak and dim
But don't go swimmin' with a mermaid, son, if you don't know how to swim!

I seen a mermaid in the waves, a-reachin' out to me
""Come live with me in the sea,"" said she, ""and down on the ocean's floor
I'll show you a million wond'rous things that you've never seen before!""
Over I jumped and she pulled me down, down to her seaweed bed
Where a pillow made of tortoise shells, she placed beneath my head
She fed me shrimps and caviar upon a silver dish
From her head to her waste she was just my taste, but the rest of her was fish!
And her hair was green as seaweed
And her skin was blue and pale
And her face it was a work of art
And I loved that girl with all of my heart
But I only loved the upper part
I did not love the tail!
Then one day she swam away, and I sang to the clams and the whales
How I missed her fins, and her seaweed hair, and the silvery shine of her scales
Then her sister swam by, and set my heart a-whirl
'Cuz her upper part was an ugly fish, but the bottom part was GIRL!
And her toes are pink and rosey
And her knees are soft and pale
And her legs they are - a work of art

47,Love Cant Ever Get Better Than This,Ricky Skaggs,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ricky-skaggs/love-cant-ever-get-better-than-this-chords-2336259,"Lookin' at you I can see what I missed
Love can't ever get better than this
I never knew there was so much in a kiss
Love can't ever get better than this
I knew this ol' world like the back of my hand
I'd known a lot of boys but I never knew a man
You were somethin', darlin', I just couldn't resist
Oh love can't ever get better than this
Love can't ever get better than this
You took a country boy & gave his life a new twist
Love can't ever get better than this
I'm tellin' everyone you're at the top of my list
Love can't ever get better than this
I made a lot of money but it didn't buy me dreams
Thought that I was rich but I was only in between
You were somethin', darlin', I just couldn't resist
Oh love can't ever get better than this
Love can't ever get better than this
Lookin' at you I can see what I missed
Love can't ever get better than this
I've been tellin' everyone you're at the top of my list
Love can't ever get better than this
I made a lot of money but it didn't buy me dreams
Thought that I was rich but I was only in between
You were somethin', darlin', I just couldn't resist
Oh love can't ever get better than this
Love can't ever get better than this
Love can't ever get better than this
Love can't ever get
Love can't ever get better than this

Just a little high headed
Thats plain to see
Don't get above your raising
Stay down on earth with me
Now looky here gal don't you high hat me
When you didn't have nothing
That was plain to see
Don't get above your raising
Stay down on earth with me
Now you need not hold your head so high
For it don't mean nothing
To me you see
Don't get above your raising
Stay sown on earth with me
Now looky here gal you better be yourself
You're country baby
That's plain to see
Don't get above your raising
Stay down on earth with me
Now I got a gal that's sweet to me
Just a little high headed
Thats plain to see
Don't get above your raising
Stay down on earth with me

49,Somebody Lied,Ricky Van Shelton,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ricky-van-shelton/somebody-lied-chords-2357591,"Hello  yeah this is me
Lord it's been a long long time
I know this ain't no social call
So go ahead get it off your mind
You heard what well it ain't true
I was here most all last night
I got over you the day you left
Could it be somebody lied
They said what that I was cryin'
I haven't shed a tear in years
That I spoke your name well that's insane
I hardly noticed you're not here
That I showed your picture to some stranger
Don't you think I got no pride
They've been here at home face down on the shelf
Lord I bet somebody lied
But if they were true what would it matter to you
Would it change the way you feel
If the rumors were right would you be here tonight
To help this old heart heal
Well don't worry it wasn't me
Just someone whose world was torn in two
Someone who looks a lot like me
And loves someone like you
So forget the tears I never cried
Lord I bet somebody lied

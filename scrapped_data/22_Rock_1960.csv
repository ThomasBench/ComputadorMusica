When I was just a baby, I didn't have many toys,
but my mama used to say, 'Son, you got more than other boys.'
Now, you may not be good looking, and you may not be too rich,
but you'll never ever be alone, cause you've got lucky lips.
Lucky lips are always kissing, lucky lips are never blue,
lucky lips will always find a pair of lips so true.
Don't need a four-leaf clover, rabbit's foot or good luck charm,
with lucky lips you'll always have a baby in your arms.
de-du-du-du-dup, de-du-du-du-dup, de-du-du-du-du, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa..
Now, I never get heartbroken, no, I never get the blues,
and if I play the game of love, I know I just can't lose.
When they spin that wheel of fortune, all I do is kiss my chips,
and I know I'm bound to win, yeah, cause I've got lucky lips.
Lucky lips are always kissing, lucky lips are never blue,
lucky lips will always find a pair of lips so true.
Don't need a four-leaf clover, rabbit's foot or good luck charm,
with lucky lips you'll always have a baby in your arms.

Cryin', ""Darling, please, let me in!""
But I don't need you
No, I don't love you anymore
So go lean on . . . go cry on
Somebody else's door
Go cry on somebody else's shoulder
I'm somewhat wiser now
And one whole year older
I sure don't need you now
And I don't love you anymore        (Oh, my darling!)
Go ahead and cry
Go ahead and let the tears fall out of your eye (Darling)
Let 'em fall on your dress
Who cares if it makes a mess?
I gave you my high school ring
At the root beer stand
We had a teen-age love, baby
I thought it was charp
It was really so grand . . . but
You cheated me baby
And told some dirty lies about me
Fooled around with all those other guys
That's why I had to get my khakis pressed
I sure don't need you now
And I don't love you anymore

I,   think of you,    and things you do,
   Go round my head,    the things you said,
Like, 'I love only you.'

   Don't you know that it's so.
   There'll be no sad tomorrow,

You'll understand.

Très bien ensemble.
I will say the only words I know that
You'll understand, my Michelle.

Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?
It's only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love and that is all,
But It's so hard loving you._______
Is it right that you and I should fight,              every night?
Just the sight of you makes night time bright,            very bright.
Haven't I the right to make it up, girl?
It's only love and that is all,
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love and that is all,
But it's so hard loving you,
Yes it's so hard loving you,
Loving You.________________

Buys a twenty carat golden ring (Golden ring?)

And in the evening she's a singer with the band

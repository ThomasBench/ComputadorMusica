0,Ohne Dich (ver 2),Rammstein,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/rammstein/ohne-dich-chords-266311,"Ich werde in die Tannen geh'n,
dahin, wo ich sie zuletzt geseh'n,
doch der Abend wirft ein Tuch auf's Land
und auf die Wege hinter'm Waldesrand
und der Wald er steht so schwarz und leer,
weh mir oh weh
und die Vögel singen nicht mehr
Ohne dich kann ich nicht sein, ohne dich
Mit dir bin ich auch allein, ohne dich (ohne Dich)
Ohne dich zähl ich die Stunden, ohne dich
Mit dir stehen die Sekunden, lohnen nicht (Ohne dich)
Auf den Nestern, in den Gräben
ist es nun still und ohne leben
und das atmen fällt mir ach so schwer
weh mir oh weh
und die Vögel singen nicht mehr.
Ohne dich kann ich nicht sein, ohne dich
Mit dir bin ich auch allein, ohne dich (ohne Dich)
Ohne dich zähl ich die Stunden, ohne dich
Mit dir stehen die Sekunden, lohnen nicht (Ohne dich)

           Ohne Dich

und das atmen fällt mir ach so schwer
weh mir oh weh

Ohne dich kann ich nicht sein, ohne dich
Mit dir bin ich auch allein, ohne dich (ohne Dich)
Ohne dich zähl ich die Stunden, ohne dich
Mit dir stehen die Sekunden, lohnen nicht (Ohne dich)
   Ohne Dich       Ohne Dich
   Ohne Dich       oooohne Dich

1,You Know My Name,Chris Cornell,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/chris-cornell/you-know-my-name-chords-429385,"If you take a life do you know what you'll give?
Odds are, you won't like what it is.
When the storm arrives, would you be seen with me?
By the merciless eyes of deceit?
I've seen angels fall from blinding heights
But you yourself are nothing so divine 
Just next in line.
Arm yourself because no-one else here will save you
The odds will betray you
And I will replace you
You can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you
It longs to kill you
Are you willing to die?
The coldest blood runs through my veins
You know my name
If you come inside things will not be the same
When you return to the night
And if you think you've won
You never saw me change
The game that we all been playing
I've seen diamonds cut through harder men
Than you yourself
But if you must pretend
You may meet your end
Arm yourself because no-one else here will save you
The odds will betray you
And I will replace you
You can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you
It longs to kill you
Are you willing to die?
The coldest blood runs through my veins
Try to hide your hand
Forget how to feel (Forget how to feel)
Life is gone with just a spin of the wheel (Spin of the wheel)
Arm yourself because no-one else here will save you
The odds will betray you
And I will replace you
You can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you
It longs to kill you
Are you ready to die?
The coldest blood runs through my veins

And turning all against the one

Another clever word
sets off an unsuspecting herd
and as you step back into line
A mob jumps to their feet
Now dance fucker dance
man he never had a chance
And no one even knew
it was really only you
And now you steal away
take him out today
Nice work you did
you’re gonna go far, kid
With a thousand lies and a good disguise
Hit ‘em right between the eyes
Hit ‘em right between the eyes
when you walk away,nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes
See ‘em running for their lives
Slowly out of line
and drifting closer in your sights
So play it out I’m wide awake
it’s a scene about me
There’s something in your way
and now someone's gonna pay
And if you can’t get what you want
well it’s all because of me
Now dance fucker dance
man I never had a chance
And no one even knew
it was really only you
And now you’ll lead the way
show the light of day
Nice work you did
You’re gonna go far, kid

Lets talk this over; its not like we're dead.
Was it something i did? Was it something you said?
Don't leave me hanging in a city so dead.
Held up so high on such a breakable thread.
And you were all the things I thought I knew.
And I thought we could be.
You were everything, everything that I wanted.
And we were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it.
And all of the memories so close to me just fade away.
All this time you were pretending, so much for my happy ending.

They tell you I'm difficult, but so are they.
But they don't know me, do they even know you?

You were everything, everything that I wanted.
And we were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it.

 It's nice to know that you were there,
Thanks for acting like you cared,
And making me feel like I was the only one.
 It's nice to know we had it all, thanks for watching as I fall,
And letting me know we were done.

Fifty years before you
In a house
On the street where you live
Maybe I'd be outside
As you passed on your bike
Would I know?
And in a wide sea of eyes
I see one pair that I recognize
And I know
That I am
I     am

Ever found a way to say to you
Next door
There's an old man
Who lived to his nineties
And one day, passed away in his sleep
And his wife, she stayed
For a couple of days and passed away

We belong

People fail to be drawn up,
Sunlight to fate accumulates,
Loving pain to be clung to,
By luminous bodies,
Only waiting for long signs to be wrong,
And true to us,
Out of place in my own time,
Drowning thinking that I'm dry,
Holding on to facts that will never be proven,
Faking an action cuz no one is looking,

The Cops hated us hangin' out, they say somebody went and burned it down.

We said someday we'd find out how it feels to sing to more than just the
steering wheel. Kim's the first girl I kissed. I was so nervous that I nearly missed.
She's had a couple of kids since then. I haven't seen her since god knows

I know what it means and I'll carry you home.
I'll carry you home.

through the veins of history
I'll show you a God who
falls asleep on the job
And how can we win when
Fools can be kings?
Don't waste your time or time
Will waste you
No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive
No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive
No one's gonna take me alive
The time has come to make things right
You and I must fight for our rights
You and I must fight to survive

For you to bring a fairy tale my way
Been living in a fantasy without meaning
It's not okay  I don´t feel saa...afe
I don´t feel safe... ooohh
  Left broken empty in despair
  Thought you were sent from up above
But you and me never had love
So much more I have to say
Help me find a way
And I wonder if you know, how it really feels
To be left outside alone, when it's cold out here
Well maybe you should know, just how it feels
To be left outside alone, to be left outside alone
All my life I've been waiting
For you to bring a fairy tale my way
Been living in a fantasy without meaning
It's not okay, I don't feel safe, I need to  pray
  Why do you play me like a game?
Always someone else to blame
Someday you might understand
There's not much more to say
But I hope you find a way
Still I wonder if you know, how it really feels
To be left outside alone, when it's cold out here
Well maybe you should know, just how it feels
To be left outside alone, to be left outside alone
All my life I've been waiting
For you to bring a fairy tale my way
Been living in a fantasy without meaning
It's not okay, I don't feel safe, I need to  praaay_hey
 oohh  Heavenly Father (heavenly father), please (please),
save me (save me) oohhh
And I wonder if you know, how it really feels
To be left outside alone , When it's cold out here
Well maybe you should know , just how it feels
To be left outside alone , to be left outside alone
All my life I've been waiting
For you to bring a fairy tale my way
Been living in a fantasy without meaning
It's not okay, I don't feel safe, I need to  praaay_hey

49,Never Too Late,Three Days Grace,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/three-days-grace/never-too-late-chords-383493,"   This world will never be, what I expected
   And if I don't belong, who would have guessed it
   I will not leave alone, everything that I own
   To make you feel like, it's not too late 
 It's never too late
   Even if I say, it'll be alright
Still I hear you say, you want to end your life
Now and again we try, to just stay alive
 Maybe we'll turn it all around, 'Cause it's not too late
 It's never too late
   No one will ever see, this side reflected
   And if there's something wrong, who would have guessed it
   And I have left alone, everything that I own
   To make you feel like, it's not too late
 It's never too late
   Even if I say, it'll be alright
Still I hear you say, you want to end your life
Now and again we try, to just stay alive
 Maybe we'll turn it all around, 'Cause it's not too late
 It's never too late
The world we knew, won't come back
The time we've lost, can't get back
The life we had, won't be ours again
   This world will never be, what I expected
   And if I don't belong ...
   Even if I say, it'll be alright
Still I hear you say, you want to end your life
Now and again we try, to just stay alive

Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
And everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh
  In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Answer the phone,
""Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kinda pills are you on?""
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh
  In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America, two kids, follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first
(Hey!)
As it was
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was

To think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do,  mm-mm
  Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable, ooh
So if you really wanna know

I'm happier than ever (I'm happier than ever)

You called me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut them all out for you 'cause I was a kid
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone

You said it looked better on me than it did you
Only if you knew, how much I liked you
But I watch your eyes as she
Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes, brighter than a blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die
Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better
Wish I were Heather
Watch as she stands with her, holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder
But how could I hate her? She's such an angel
But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she

You say somethin' so lovin', but

  You'll be better off in someone new

Vedrai Coraline che piange
Che prende il dolore degli altri

Ma un giorno, una volta lei ci riuscirà

Riparo d’inverno
Sarò ciò che respiri
Capirò cosa hai dentro
E sarò l’acqua da bere
Il significato del bene
Sarò anche un soldato
O la luce di sera
E in cambio non chiedo niente
Soltanto un sorriso
Ogni tua piccola lacrima è oceano sopra al mio viso
E in cambio non chiedo niente
Solo un po’ di tempo
Sarò vessillo, scudo

Caught a vibe, (woo woo)
Baby are you coming for the ride? (The ride, the ride, the ride)
I just wanna look into your eyes (Your eyes, your eyes)
I just wanna stay for the night, night,   night
When we take a drive (woo woo)
maybe we can hit the 405
Hypnotized by the lights,
man, this must be the life
When I go to sleep,
I can't even fall asleep
Something's got ahold of me,
feel it taking over me

I'll be moving onward

I'm gettin' older, I think I'm agin' well
I wish someone had told me I'd be doin' this by myself
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for
But it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door
Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more
Than anyone before (Anyone before)
  Too bad they're usually deranged
Last week, I realized I crave pity
When I re-tell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest
I was still bein' ignored (Lyin' for attention, just to get neglection)
Now we're estranged
 Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much, until we don't
I'm gettin' older, I've got more on my shoulders
But I'm gettin' better at admitting when I'm wrong
I'm happier than ever, at least, that's my endeavor
To keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure
'Cause to be honest, I just wished the word I promised
Would depend on what I'm givin' (Not on his permission)
(Wasn't my decision) To be abused, mm
 Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much, until we don't
But next week, I hope I'm somewhere laughin'
For anybody asking, I promise I'll be fine
I've had some trauma, did things I didn't wanna
Was too afraid to tell ya, but now, I think it's time
    Okay
 Mm-mm, I
I didn't change my number
I only changed who I reply to
Laura said I should be nicer
But not to you
I love a ""You mad at me?"" text
Should have guessed
That you would think I was upset (Haha)
You're obsessed
Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean
I didn't change my number
I only changed who I believe in
You were easy on the eyes, eyes, eyes (Eyes, еyes)
But looks can be decеivin'
I gotta work, I go to work
You don't deserve to feel so hurt
You gotta a lot of fuckin' nerve
I don't deserve, so
Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean
And take it out on you
And your best friend too
I should have left when Drew
Said you were bad news
  Mm-mm-mm
  Mm-mm-mm
  Mm-mm-mm
  Mm-mm-mm
  Mm-mm-mm
  Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Na-na-na
Love when it comes without a warning
'Cause waiting for it gets so boring
A lot can change in twenty seconds
A lot can happen in the dark
Love when it makes you lose your bearings
Some information's not for sharing
Use different names at hotel check-ins
It's hard to stop it once it starts (It starts)
I'm not sentimental
But there's somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight, mmm
Makes me wanna take a picture
Make a movie with you that we'd have to hide
You better lock your phone (Oh)
And look at me when you're alone
Won't take a lot to get you goin' (Oh)
I'm sorry if it's torture though
I know, I know
It might be more of an obsession
You really make a strong impression (You sure do)
Nobody saw me in the lobby (Saw me in the lobby)
Nobody saw me in your arms, mmm
I'm not sentimental
Makes me wanna make 'em jealous
I'm the only one who does it how you like (Only one who does it how you—)
You better lock your phone (Oh)
And look at me when you're alone (You're alone, you're alone)
Won't take a lot to get you goin' (Get me goin', get me goin')
I'm sorry if it's torture though (Torture though)
I know, I know
You better lock your door (Oh)
And look at me a little more
We both know I'm worth waitin' for (Waitin' for)
That heavy breathin' on the floor (On the floor)
I'm yours, I'm yours (I'm yours)
I'm not sentimental
I'm not sentimental
I'm not sentimental
I can't seem to focus
And you don't seem to notice
I'm not here
I'm just a mirror
You check your complexion
to find your reflection
Is all alone
I had to go
Can't you hear me
I'm not coming home
Do you understand
I've changed my plans
Cause I'm in love
With my future
Can't wait to meet her
And I,
I'm in love
But not with anybody else
Just wanna get to know myself
  I know supposedly I'm lonely now (Lonely now)
  Know I'm supposed to be unhappy without (Someone)
Someone but aren't I someone? (Aren't I someone? Yeah)
I
Like to be your answer (Be your answer)
Cause you're so handsome (You're so handsome)
But I know better
Than to drive you home
Cause you'd invite me in
And I'd be yours again
But I, I'm in love (Love, love, love, love)
With my future
And you don't know her
And I, I'm in love (Love, love)
But not with anybody here
I'll see you in a couple years
Em x5
Can't take it back once it's been set in motion
You know I love to rub it in like lotion
If you only     pray on  Sunday
Could you come my  way on   Monday?
'Cause I like to    do things God doe-sn't    approve of if she   saw us
She couldn't look away, look away, look away
She'd wanna get involved, involved, involved
And what would people say, people say, people say
If they listen through the wall, the wall, the wall?
 I can   see it clear as day
You don't really need to pray
Wanna    see what you can take
You should really run away
I wanna  do bad   things to you (To you)
I wanna  make you yell (Yell)
I wanna do bad things to you (To you)
Don't wanna treat you well (Well)
Can't take it back once it's been set in motion
You know I need you for the Oxytocin
If you find it  hard to  swallow
I can loosin'  up your  collar
'Cause as long as  you're still breathing
Don't you even     think of leaving
I kinda wanna look away, look away, look away
Kinda wanna get involved, involved, involved
And what would people say, people say, people say
If they listen through the wall, the wall, the wall?
 I can   see it clear as day
You don't really need to pray
Wanna    see what you can take
You should really run away
Other    people would have stayed
Other    people don't obey
You and  me are both the same 
You should really run away
Bad things
I wanna  do bad   things to you
I wanna  make you yell
I wanna do bad things to you
Don't wanna treat you well
Goldwing angel
Go home, don't tell
Anyone what you are
You're sacred and they're starved
And their art is gettin' dark
And there you are to tear apart
Tear apart, tear apart, tear apart
You better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
Better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
They're gonna tell you what you wanna hear
Then they're gonna disappear
Gonna claim you like you a souvenir
Just to sell you in a year
You better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
Keep your head down-down (Down)
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
Better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
Keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
Somethin' in the...
Somethin' in the air right now
Like I'm losin' track of time (Time, time)
Like I don't really care right now
But maybe that's fine
You weren't even there that day
I was waitin on you (You, you)
I wonder if you aware away that day
Was the last straw for me
And I know I sent you flowers (Know, know)
Did you even care?
You ran the shower
And left them by the stairs
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy, uhh
 Thought you had your shit together, but damn I was wrong
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (Cause, cause)
And this ain't nothin' like it once was (Was, was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job (Job)
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (Cause, cause)
And this ain't nothin' like it once was (Was, was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw
 I used to think you werе shy (shy)
Or maybe you just had nothing on your mind
Maybe you were thinkin' 'bout yourself all the time (time)
I used to wish you were mine (mine)
But that was way before I realized
Someone like you would always be so easy to find
(Um, um, so) So easy (easy, so, easy)
Easy, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
 Gave me no flowers
Wish I didn't care
You'd been gone for hours
Could be anywhere (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I thought you would've grown eventually
But you proved me wrong
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause
And this ain't nothin' like it once was
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause
And this ain't nothin' like it once was
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job
 What did I tell you?
Don't get complacent
It's time to face it now
 What did I tell you?
Don't get complacent
It's time to face it now
I don't want it
And I don't want to want you
But in my dreams, I seem to be more honest
And I must admit you've been in quite a few
Halley's Comet
Comes around more than I do
But you're all it takes for me to break a promise
Silly me to fall in love with you
I haven't slept since Sunday
Midnight for me is 3AM for you
But my sleepless nights are better
With you the nights could never be alone, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
I was good at feeling nothin', now I'm hopeless
What a drag to love you like I do, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I've been loved before, but right now in this moment
I feel more and more likе I was made for you
     For you
I'm sitting in my brother's room
  Haven't slеpt in a week, or two, or two
I think I might have fallen in love
What am I to do?
Do you know me?
Really know me?
You have opinions about my opinions
About my music
About my clothes
Some people hate what I wear
Some people use it to shame others
But I feel you watching
And nothing I do goes unseen
So while I feel your stares, your disapproval or your sigh of relief
Would you like me to be smaller, weaker, softer, taller?
Would you like me to be quiet?
Am I my stomach? My hips?
Is it not what you wanted?
If I wear what is comfortable, I am not a woman
If I shed the layers, I'm a slut
Though you've never seen my body, you still judge it
Why?
We decide who they are
If I wear more, if I wear less
Is my value based only on your perception?
I don't really even know how it happened
I don't really even know how it happened
I don't really (I don't really) how it happened

Stop bein' flirty (He-he-he)
Did you really think this is the right thing to do?
That I really looked just like the rest of you
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
I'm overheated, can't bе defeated
I'm overheated
And everybody said it was a let down
'Cause I'm not about to redesign myself now, am I?
All these other inanimate bitches
Posin' for pictures with that plastic body?
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
I'm overheated, can't bе defeated

Everybody dies, surprise, surprise
We tell each other lies, sometimes, we try
To make it feel like we might be right
We might not be alone
Be alone
""Everybody dies,"" that's what they say
And maybe, in a couple hundred years, they'll find another way
I just wonder why you'd wanna stay
If everybody goes
You'd still be alone
I don't wanna cry, some days I do
But not about you
It's just a lot to think about
The world I'm used to
The one I can't get back, at lеast not for a while
I sure have a knack for seein' lifе more like a child
It's not my fault, it's not so wrong to wonder why
Everybody dies, and when will I?
You oughta know
That even when it's time, you might not wanna go
But it's okay to cry and it's alright to fall
But you are not alone
You are not alone
    Try not to abuse your power
    I know we didn't choose to change
    You might not wanna lose your power
    But havin' it's so strange
She said you were a hero, you played the part
But you ruined her in a year, don't act like it was hard
And you swear you didn't know (didn't know, didn't know)
I wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleeping in your clothes (in your clothes, in your clothes)
But now she's got to get to class
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad when they find out?
If you could take it all back,  would you?
    Try not to abuse your power
    I know we didn't choose to change
    You might not wanna lose your power
    But havin' it's so strange
I thought that I was special
You made me feel like it was my fault you were the devil
Lost your appeal
Does it keep you in control? (in control)
For you to keep her in a cage?
And you swear you didn't know (didn't know)
You said you thought she was your age
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad if it turns out
That they kill your contract?
  Would you?
    Try not to abuse your power
    I know we didn't choose to change
    You might not wanna lose your power
    But power isn't pain

Got a stalker walkin' up and down the street

I bought a secret house when I was seventeen
Haven't had a party since I got the keys
Had a pretty boy over, but he couldn't stay
On his way out I made him sign an NDA, mm
Yeah, I made him sign an NDA
Once is good enough
'Cause I don't want him having shit to say-ay, ayy, ayy, ayy-ayy
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go,    oh, no
I can crave it, but you don't need to know, oh-oh
Mm, mm-mm, mm
30 Under 30 for another year (Another year)
I can barely go outside, I think I hate it herе (Think I hate it here)
Maybе I should think about a new career
Somewhere in Kaua'i where I can disappear

Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth
At least I gave him something he can cry about
I thought about my future, but I want it now, oh-oh
Want it now, mm-mm-mm
You can't keep me up
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go,    oh, no
I can crave it, but you don't need to know, oh-oh

How'd it get so dark? (So dark)
I saw stars (I saw stars)

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true, mmm
Give me a day or two
To think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable, ooh
So if you really wanna know
When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (I'm happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)

You called me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut them all out for you 'cause I was a kid
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone
Home alone, tryin' not to eat
Distract myself with pornography
I hate the way she looks at me
I can't stand the dialogue, she would never be
That satisfied, it's a male fantasy
I'm goin' back to therapy
'Cause I loved you then
And I love you now and I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know
When nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you
(Want me to sing in here?)
I got a call from a girl I used to know
We were inseparable years ago
Thought we'd get along but it wasn't so
And it's all I think about when I'm behind the wheel
I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel
But nothing lasts, I know the deal
'Cause I loved you then
And I love you now and I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know
When nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you
Can't get over you
No matter what I  do

Broke your windows
Broke your tiles, frozen willows
Hope to let go
And you don't know

Cuts deeper as my head goes nuts

I go where I want to

Disbelief heads suspensions

Your social media scoured
You seek police interventions

Til the black sky, turns back to indigo

 Beneath a poisoned sky
 Under a bad sign
The micro-age of Gemini
And we are still unlearning
Tirеs are burning in the middle of Rodеo Drive
Know that we’ve been beaten down and broken
But now we could testify
 We can make it if you don’t quit on me

My chest with my fist

Never had nobody as sweet as you
Smoother on the edges, good as new
Gently insulating, every rendezvous
Caught myself blaming planets

Repair the stitches in my veins

Beneath the skin, it's cardiac
The safety pin

My mother was a tailor (organ: F7) 
She sewed my new blue jeans (organ: E7)

Is when he's on a drunk              (organ plays E7)
O, mother, tell your children (organ: F7) 
Not to do what I have done (organ: E7) 
Spend your lives in sin and misery
In the House of Rising Sun              (organ plays E7)

You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirt you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to ground control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today
For here am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue and there's nothing I can do
Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much she knows
Ground control to Major Tom, your circuit's dead, there's something wrong

Can you hear me Major Tom? Can you...

All lies and jest still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest
When I left my home and family I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of a railway station running scared
Laying low seeking out the poorer quarters where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know
Lie-la-lie
Lie-la-la-la-la lie-la-lie
Lie la lie
Lie-la la la la la lie la la la la lie
Asking only workmans wages I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on Seventh Avenue
I do declare there were times when I was so lonesome I took some comfort there
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
                 (2/4)
                 (2/4)
Now the years are rolling by me, they are rocking evenly
And I am older than I once was
And younger than I'll be, that's not unusual
No, it isn't strange, after changes upon changes we are more or less the same 
After changes we are more or less the same
Lie-la-lie
Lie-la-la-la-la lie-la-lie
Lie la lie
Lie-la la la la la lie la la la la lie
Then I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone
Going home where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
 Leading me-e
Going home
In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of ev'ry glove that laid him down or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
""I am leaving, I am leaving."" but the fighter still remains
Hm, hm, hm

 I read the news today, oh boy
 About a lucky man who made the grade
 And though the news was rather sad
 Well, I just had to laugh
 I saw the photograph
 He blew his mind out in a car
 He didn't notice that the lights had changed
 A crowd of people stood and stared
 They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords
 I saw a film today, oh boy
 The English Army had just won the war
 A crowd of people turned away
 But I just had to look
 Having read the book
I'd love to turn    you    on                      (orchestral glissando)
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream.
(Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh)
I read the news today oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

Though I know that evenings empire has returned into sand,
Vanished from my hand,
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping.
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet,
I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,

My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip,
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
To be wandering.
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way,
I promise to go under it.

Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escaping on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facing.
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind,
I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're
Seeing that he's chasing.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you.
Then take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind,
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves,
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach,
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,

Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near.
Look at him working. darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at All the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
And I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game
I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank
Held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged
And the bodies stank
Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzling you
Is the nature of my game
I watched with glee
While your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades
For the Gods they made
I shouted out
""Who killed the Kennedys?""
When after all
It was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
And I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reached Bombay

And all the sinners saints

Have some courtesy
Have some sympathy, and some taste
Use all your well-learned politesse
Or I'll lay your soul to waste, um yeah

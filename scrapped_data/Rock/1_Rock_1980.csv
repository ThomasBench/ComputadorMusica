0,Sweet Child O Mine,Guns N' Roses,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/guns-n-roses/sweet-child-o-mine-chords-176076,"She's got a smile that it seems to me
Reminds me of childhood memories
Where everything
Was as fresh as a bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I stared too long
I'd probably break down and cry
Whoa oh, sweet child o' mine
Whoa, oh, oh, oh sweet love o' mine
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I'd hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder and rain
To quietly pass me by
Whoa oh, oh, sweet child o' mine
Whoa, oh, oh, oh sweet love o' mine
Whoa oh, sweet child o' mine
Whoa, oh, oh, oh sweet love o' mine
Whoa oh, oh, oh sweet child o' mine
Ooooooooh sweet love o' mine
Where do we go, where do we go now, where do we go
Where do we go, where do we go now, oh where do we go now
Where do we go,   sweet child, where do we go now
Aih, aih, aih, aih, aih, aih, aih, oh where do we go now
Where do we go,  ohhhhh, where do we go now
Where do we gooooooo, where do we go now
Where do we goooo, ohhh where do we go now, now-now-now-now-now-now-now

3,Fast Car (ver 3),Tracy Chapman,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tracy-chapman/fast-car-chords-1044807,"You got a fast car.
I want a ticket to anywhere.
Maybe we make a deal,
Maybe together we can get somewhere.
Any place is better.
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose.
Maybe we'll make something,
Me myself, I got nothing to prove.
You got a fast car.
I got a plan to get us out of here:
I been working at the convenience store,
Managed to save just a little bit of money.
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city, 
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living.
You see, my old man's got a problem:
He live with the bottle, that’s the way it is.
He says his body's too old for working,
His body's too young to look like his.
My mama went off and left him, she wanted more from life than he could give,
I said, ""Somebody's got to take care of him.""
So I quit school and that's what I did.
You got a fast car.
But is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision:
Leave tonight or live and die this way.
So I remember when: we were driving, driving in your car,
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk,
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder. 
And I   had a feeling that I belonged
And I   had a feeling I could -- be someone, be someone, be someone.
You got a fast car.
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves;
you still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl.
I know things will get better:
You'll find work and I'll get promoted, 
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs.
So I remember when: we were driving, driving in your car,
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk,
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder. 
And I   had a feeling that I belonged
And I   had a feeling I could -- be someone, be someone, be someone.
You got a fast car.
And I got a job that pays all our bills.
You stay out drinking late at the bar,
You see more your friends than you do your kids.
I'd always hoped for better,
Thought maybe together you and me would find it,
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere,
so take your fast car and keep on driving.
So I remember when: we were driving, driving in your car,
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk,
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder. 
And I   had a feeling that I belonged

We were young and restless
We needed to unwind

want to see lights
Driving in your car
Oh, please don't drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their home
and I'm welcome no more

crashes into us
  to die by your side
is such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us
  to die by your side

Though I tried not to hurt you, though I tried, but I guess that's why they say
Every rose has its thorn.
Just like every night has its dawn.
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song.
Every rose has its thorn.
I listen to our favorite song, playing on the radio.
Hear the DJ say love's a game of easy come and   easy go.
But I wonder, does he know, has he ever felt like this?
And I know that you'd be here right now if I
  coulda let you know, somehow I guess
Every rose has its thorn.
Just like every night has its dawn.
Just like every cowboy sings a sad, sad song.
Every rose has its thorn.
  Though it's been a while now, I can still feel so much pain.
 Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals, but the scar, that scar remains
I know I coulda saved our love that night if I'd     known what to say.
  Instead of making love we both  made our separate ways.
And now I hear you've found somebody new, and that I never meant that much to you.
To hear that tears me up inside, and to see you cuts me like a knife, I guess

She took the midnight train going anywhere
Just a city boy, born and raised in south Detroit
He took the midnight train going anywhere
A singer in a smoky room, a smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night, it goes on and on and on and on
Strangers waiting up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlight, people, living just to find emotion
Hiding, somewhere in the night
Working hard to get my fill, everybody wants a thrill
Paying anything to roll the dice, just one more time
Some will win, some will lose, some were born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends; it goes on and on and on and on
Strangers waiting up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night

They bring you up to do like your daddy done
Me and Mary we met in high school  When she was just seventeen
We'd drive out of this valley down to where the fields were green
We'd go down to the river And into the river we'd dive
Oh down to the river we’d ride
Then I got Mary pregnant  And man, that was all she wrote
And for my 19th birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat
We went down to the courthouse  And the judge put it all to rest
No wedding day smiles, no walk down the aisle
No flowers, no wedding dress
That night we went down to the river
And into the river we'd dive
Oh down to the river we did ride
I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company
But lately there ain't been much work on account of the economy
Now all them things that seemed so important
Well mister they vanished right into the air
Now I just act like I don't remember   Mary acts like she don't care
But I remember us riding in my brother's car   Her body tan and wet down at
the reservoir    At night on them banks I'd lie awake
And pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
Now those memories come back to haunt me
They haunt me like a curse
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true    Or is it something worse
That sends me down to the river   Though I know the river is dry
That sends me down to the river tonight
Down to the river my baby and I
Oh down to the river we ride     Ooh..

  Laying everybody low     with a love song that he made
  Finds a convenient street light, steps out of the shade
Says something like...  you and me babe, how 'bout it?
  Juliet says hey it's Romeo!      you nearly gave me a heart attack..
He's underneath the window,    singing hey la, my boyfriend's back
  You shouldn't come around here singing up to people like that
Anyway,  what you gonna do about it?
Juliet,   the dice was loaded from the start
And I bet,   and you exploded in my heart
And I forget, I forget    the movie song
   When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?
  We come up on different streets,     and they were both streets of shame
Both dirty, both mean,    and yes the dream was just the same
   I dreamed your dream for you... and now your dream is real
  How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?
Well, you can fall for chains of silver,      you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers     and the promises they hold
  You promised me everything, you promised me thick and thin, yeah
  Now you just say ..oh Romeo? yeah I used to have a scene with him
Juliet,   when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die
There's a place for us,     you know the movie song
   When you gonna realize its just that the time was wrong, Juliet?
  I can't do the talk      like they talk on the TV
And I can't do a love song      like the way it's meant to be
  I can't do everything, but I'd do anything for you
  I can't do anything except be in love with you
   And all I do is miss you      and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat     and bad company
   All I do is kiss you   through the bars of a rhyme
   Juliet... I'd do the stars with you anytime
Juliet,   when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die
There's a place for us,     you know the movie song
   When you gonna realize its just that the time was wrong,  Juliet?

Knockin' me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air,
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking, the earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
Working double time on the seduction line
She was one of a kind, she's just mine, all mine
Wanted no applause, just another course
Made a meal out of me and come back for more
Had to cool me down to take a-nother round,
Now I'm back in the ring to take a-nother swing
'Cause the walls were shaking, the earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

  I feel it in the air, the summer's out of reach.
Empty lake, empty streets, the sun goes down alone.
  I'm driving by your house, though I know you're not home.
But I can see you, your brown skin shining in the sun.
You got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on, baby.
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone.
   I never will forget those nights, I wonder if it was a dream.
  Remember how you made me crazy, remember how I made you scream.
  Now I don't understand what happened to our love.
But babe, I'm gonna get you back, I'm gonna show you what I'm made of.
I can see you, your brown skin shining in the sun.
I see you walkin' real slow and smiling to everyone.
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone.
   Out on the road today I saw a Deadhead Sticker on a Cadillac.
  A little voice inside my head said: ""Don't look back, you can never look back.""
  I thought I knew what love was. What did I know?
  Those days are gone forever, I should just let 'em go, but
I can see you, your brown skin shining in the sun.
You got the top pulled down and radio on, baby.
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone.
I can see you, your brown skin shining in the sun.
You got your hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby.
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone.

Shaves in the dark, trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy his new clothes
Keeps a ten bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man,  mean old man
His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the Queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man,  dirty old man

And say hello
You're my very special one

And the people on subways and trains
Looking gray in the rain as they stand disarrayed
Oh but people look well in the dark

Swaying in the ripples and the reeds.
On a trip to   Cirrus Minor, saw a crater in the sun
A thousand miles of moonlight later.

For my monster from his slab began to rise

(The monster mash)  It was a graveyard smash 
(He did the mash)   It caught on in a flash 
(He did the mash)   He did the monster mash
From my laboratory in the castle east 
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast 
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes 
To get a jolt from my electrodes

(The monster mash)    It was a graveyard smash 
(They did the mash)   It caught on in a flash 
(They did the mash)   They did the monster mash
The zombies were having fun 
The party had just begun 
The guests included Wolf Man 
Dracula and his son 
The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds 
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds 
The Coffin-Bangers were about to arrive 
With their vocal group, ""The Crypt-Kicker Five""

(The monster mash)        It was a graveyard smash 
(They played the mash)    It caught on in a flash 
(They played the mash)    They played the monster mash
Out from his coffin, Drac's voice did ring 
Seems he was troubled by just one thing 
Opened the lid and shook his fist 
And said,   ""Whatever happened to my Transylvania twist?""

You didn't understand my love
You don't know why I try
And the rain was falling on that day
And damn the reason why
The Flying Pisces sails for time
And tells me of my child
Wrapped in bitter tales and heartache
He begs for just a smile

He never asked to fly
And through his eye he comes his love
And tells her not to cry

With a dancer called a queen
And with her stolen cards he plays
And laughs, but never wins
O the child dreams to be his hands
In the counting of the rain
But only barren breasts he feels
For her milk will never drain
As I die I can't remember
Where I saw the rain
Could it be that her laughter
Drove me down again?
Charming dancer will you stop,
Stop and talk to me?
Is there someone else you feel
In your dreams? you will, you see:
In midnight gazes
I've found you far from me
If you lead me on
Please leave me down
O Flying Flying Fish
Please flutter by my door
Yes you can drink my lies
If first you read my eyes:
Each one is titled
""I'm drowning back to you"";
I can't swim your waters
And you can't walk my lands:

And I'm climbing all my fears

And love me for a while?

44,Bird On The Wire,Joe Cocker,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/joe-cocker/bird-on-the-wire-chords-1519181,"Like a bird on the wire,
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free.
Like a worm on a hook,
Like a knight from some old fashioned book
I have saved all my ribbons for thee.
If I, if I have been unkind,
Well I hope that you can just let it go by.
And if I, if I have been untrue
Well I hope you know it was never to you.
Like a baby, stillborn,
Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch,
Well he said to me, ""You must not ask for so much.""
And a pretty woman standing by her darkened door,
She said to me, ""why not ask for more?"" 
Oh like a bird on the wire,
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
I have tried in my way to be free

I sit and watch the children play
Smiling faces I can see          ahhh but not for me
I sit and watch as tears go by
My riches   can't buy everything
I want to hear  the children  sing
But all I hear is the sound
Of rain falling on the ground
I sit and watch as tears go by
It is the evening   of the day
I sit and watch the children play
Doing things I used to do
Aaah  but where are you
I sit and watch as tears go  by
Mmmmm....  Mmmmm....(To fade...)

Swept along the open road, that don't seem to begin,
Come with me and love me babe, I may be back again.
Mean time I'll keep sailing down my highway in the wind.
Evenings just begin the days, and follows with the night,
To love you and to be with you and to say that it's all right.
Love me while you have me, babe, I may be back again.
Meantime I'll keep sailing down this highway in the wind.
There's times I feel like going, and there's time I want to stay.
Times that I ain't feeling well, and times I feel okay.
Now you have time to love me, babe, I may have time again.
Meantime I'll keep sailing down this highway in the wind.
The fortune-teller tells me, that I have somewhere to go.
Look and try to understand, wonder how she knows.
I must be going now, I'm losing time my friends,
Looking for a rainbow on this highway in the wind.

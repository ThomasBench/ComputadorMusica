0,Subterranean Homesick Blues (ver 2),Bob Dylan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bob-dylan/subterranean-homesick-blues-chords-1875324,"Johny's in the basement,Mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement, Thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat, Badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough, Wants to get it paid off
Look out kid   It's somethin' you did
God knows when,  But you're doin' it again
You better duck down the alley way
Lookin' for a new friend
The man in the coon-skip cap, In the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills,     You only got ten.
Maggie comes fleet foot,   Face full of black soot
Talkin' that the heat put,  Plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway,  Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early May,  Orders from the da
Look out kid,   Don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes,   Don't try, 'No Doz'
Better stay away from those
That carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose,    Watch the plain clothes
You don't need a weather man
To know which way the wind blows
Get sick, get well,   Hang around an ink well
Ring bell, hard to tell,   If anything is goin' to sell
Try hard, get barred,    Get back, write Braille
Get jailed, jump bail Join the army, if you fail
Look out kid,  You're gonna get hit
By losers, cheaters,   Six-time users
Hang around the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders,    Watch the parkin' meters.
Ah get born, keep warm
Short pants, romance, learn to dance
Get dressed, get blessed,   Try to be a success
Please her, please him, buy gifts
Don't steal, don't lift
Twenty years of schoolin'
And they put you on the day shift
Look out kid,   They keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole
Light yourself a candle,   Don't wear sandals
Try to avoid the scandals
Don't wanna be a bum,   You better chew gum
The pump don't work
'Cause the vandals took the handles.

2,Just Like Tom Thumbs Blues,Bob Dylan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bob-dylan/just-like-tom-thumbs-blues-chords-931686,"When you're lost in the rain in Juarez
And it's Eastertime too
And negativity don't pull you through
Don't put on any airs
When you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue
They got some hungry women there 
And they really make a mess outa you.
Now if you see Saint Annie
Please tell her thanks a lot
My fingers are all in a knot
I don't have the strength
To get up and take another shot
And my best friend, my doctor
Won't even say what it is I've got.
Sweet Melinda
The peasants call her the goddess of gloom
And she invites you up into her room
And you're so kind
And careful not to go to her too soon
And she takes your voice
And leaves you howling at the moon.
Up on Housing Project Hill
It's either fortune or fame
Though neither of them are to be what they claim
If you're lookin' to get silly
You better go back to from where you came
Because the cops don't need you
And man they expect the same.
Now all the authorities
They just stand around and boast
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms
Into leaving his post
And picking up Angel who
Just arrived here from the coast
Who looked so fine at first
But left looking just like a ghost.
I started out on burgundy
But soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they'd stand behind me
When the game got rough
But the joke was on me
There was nobody even there to bluff
I'm going back to New York City
I do believe I've had enough.

Walkin' a road other men have gone down
I'm seein' your world of people and things
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings
Hey hey Woody Guthrie I wrote you a song
'Bout a funny old world that's comin' along
Seems sicked it's hungry, it's tired and it's torn
It looks like it's a-dyin' and it's hardly been born
Hey hey Woody Guthrie but I know that you know
All the things that I'm sayin' and a many times more
I'm singin' you this song, but I can't sing enough
'Cause there's not many men that done the things that you done
Here's to Cisco and Sonny and Leadbelly too
And to all the good people that traveled with you
Here's to the hearts and the hands of the men
That come with the dust and are gone with the wind
I'm leavin' tomorrow but I could leave today
Somewhere down the road someday
The very last thing that I'd want to do
Is to say I've been hittin' some hard travelin' too

Tonight as I stand inside the rain
Ev'rybody knows
That baby's got new clothes
But lately   I  see her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls.
She takes just like a woman, yes she does,
she makes love just like a woman, yes she does,
And she aches just like a woman,
but she breaks just like a little    girl.
Queen Mary, she's my friend.
Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
Nobody has to guess
That baby can't be blessed,
Till she sees finally that she's like all the rest.
With her fog, her amphetamines, and her pearls
It was raining from the first 
So I came in here 
And your long-time curse hurts 
Is this pain in here 
   I can't stay in here 
Ain't it   clear that
I just can't fit.
Yes I believe it's time for us to quit.
And when we meet again,
Introduced as friends,
Please don't let on that you knew me when,
I was hungry, and it was your world.
She takes just like a woman, yes she does,
she makes love just like a woman, yes she does,
And she aches just like a woman, 
but she breaks just like a little    girl.

Or cut him till he cried out in his anger and his shame

42,Bold As Love (ver 2),Jimi Hendrix,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jimi-hendrix/bold-as-love-chords-1472064,"  Anger,   he smiles,
towering in shiny metallic purple armour
Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground
  Blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted,
They quietly understand
Once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready,
But wonder why the fight is   on
But they're all bold as love,
  Yeah, they're all bold as love
  Yeah, they're all bold as love
  Just ask the axis
My red is so confident that he flashes trophies of war,
and ribbons of euphoria
Orange is young, full of daring,
But very unsteady for the first go round
My yellow in this case is not so mellow
In fact I'm trying to say it's frightened like me
And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from,
Giving my life to a rainbow like you
But I'm a, yeah,  I'm bold bold as love, yeah yeah
  Well I'm bold, bold as love
    I'm bold as love
Just ask the axis,    he knows everything, yeah yeah yeah....

I find a quiet place, far from the human race
Out in the country
Before the breathin' air is gone
Before the sun  is just a bright spot in the night-time
Out where the rivers like to run
I stand alone and take back somethin' worth rememberin'
Whenever I feel them closing in on me
Or need a bit of room to move
When life becomes too fast, I find relief at last
Out in the country
Before the breathin' air is gone
Before the sun  is just a bright spot in the night-time
Out where the rivers like to run

Wants it more than most any old thing,
Well when I get those jelly-roll blues,
Why I go and get anything in this world for you.
Down to the jewelry store packin' a gun,
Says, ""Wrap it up I think I'll take this one.""
""A thousand dollars please,"" the jewelry man said,
Dupree he said, ""I'll pay this one off to you in lead.""
Well you know son, you just can't figure,
First thing you know you're gonna to pull that trigger,
And it's no wonder, your reason goes bad,
Jelly-roll will drive you so mad.
Judge said, ""Son, it's gonna cost you some time.""
Dupree said, ""Judge you know that crossed my mind.""
Judge said, ""Fact it's gonna cost you your life.""
Dupree said, ""Judge you know that seems to me to be about right.""
Baby baby you gonna lose her sweet man,
Dupree come out with a losin' hand,
Baby's gonna weep it up for a while,
Then go out and find another sweet man's gonna treat her with style.
Judge said, ""Son, I know your baby well,
But that's a secret I can never tell.""
Dupree said, ""Judge well it's well understood,
But you got to admit that sweet sweet Jelly's so good.""

First thing you know you're gonna to pull that trigger,
And it's no wonder, your reason goes bad,

Some like Jelly Jelly, some like gold,
Many a man's done a terrible thing

I’m writing you to
Catch you up on places I’ve been
You held this letter
Probably got excited, but there’s nothing else inside it
Didn’t have a camera by my side this time
Hoping I would see the world through both my eyes
Maybe I will tell you all about it when i’m
In the mood to lose my way with words
Today skies are painted colors of a cowboy’s cliche’
And strange how clouds that look like mountains in the sky
Are next to mountains anyway
Didn’t have a camera by my side this time
Hoping I would see the world through both my eyes
Maybe I will tell you all about it when i’m
In the mood to lose my way but let me say
You should have seen that sunrise with your own eyes
It brought me back to life
You’ll be with me next time I go outside
No more 3x5’s
Today I finally overcame
Tryin’ to fit the world inside a picture frame
Maybe I will tell you all about it when I’m in the mood to
Lose my way but let me say
You should have seen that sunrise with your own eyes
It brought me back to life
You’ll be with me next time I go outside
No more 3x5’s
Just no more 3x5’s

Times Square cant shine as bright as you

I'm right there if you get lonely
Give this song another listen
close your eyes

Im by your side

I've got so much left to say,
if every simple song i wrote to you
would take your breath away
I'd write it all.

but they've got planes and trains and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way.

and we'll just laugh along because
we know that none of them have felt this way
Delilah I could promise you
that by the time that we get through
the world will never ever be the same
and you're to blame

you be good and dont miss me
2 more years and you'll be done with school
and I'll be making history like I do

There's nothing left here anymore.
My room is cold,
It's making me insane.
I've been waiting here so long,
Another moment seems to 've come,
I see the dark clouds coming up again.
Running through the monsoon,
Beyond the world,
To the end of time,
Where the rain won't hurt
Fighting the storm,
Into the blue,
And when I loose myself I think of you,
Together we'll be running somewhere new…
Through the monsoon.
Just me and you.
A half moon's fading from my sight,
I see your vision in its light.
But now it's gone and left me so alone
I know I have to find you now,
Can hear your name, I don't know how.
Why can't we make this darkness feel like home?
Running through the monsoon,
Beyond the world,
To the end of time,
Where the rain won't hurt
Fighting the storm,
Into the blue,
And when I loose myself I think of you,
Together we'll be running somewhere new…
And nothing can hold me back from you.
Through the monsoon. 
Hey!
I'm fighting all this power,
Coming in my way
Let it sail me straight to you,
I'll be running night and day.
I'll be with you soon…
Just me and you.
We'll be there soon…
So soon.

I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don't go, and I said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby just say yes
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while oh
Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go, and I said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say yes
Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say yes, oh - oh -oh
I got tired of waiting,   wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said
Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone

She wears a two way, but I'm not quite sure what that means.
And when she walks,
All the wind blows and the angels sing.
But she doesn't notice me!
Cause she is watchin' wrestling
Creamin' over tough guys
Listenin' to rap metal
Turntables in her eyes
It's like a bad movie
She is lookin' through me

Screamin' ""Someone shoot me!""

Tryin' to get the girl all the bad guys want.

Her cd changer's full of singers that are mad at their dad
She says she'd like to score some reefer and a forty

And when she walks,
All the wind blows and the angels sing.

Creamin' over tough guys

Drivin' in A Trans-Am

But I know I'll be coming home soon
I know that I'll be coming home soon

I am nothing but a human alien
Left with nothing else but to keep wandering
Down this path whilst stopping my hands trembling
But I know I'll be coming home soon
I know that I'll be coming home soon with a soldier's eyes
With a soldier's eyes
With a soldier's eyes
With a soldier's eyes
I've seen inside the devil's dreams where young men die
And graveyards open up their arms for mothers left to cry
I have seen the bleeding and I hate what we've done
But just like every other fool I'll keep marching on
But I know I'll be coming home soon
I know that I'll be coming home soon with a soldier's eyes
With a soldier's eyes
With a soldier's eyes

And before someone offered me drugs
You know I was straight edge
And everyone quits til you offer them a cigarette
  Before we learn our lesson
Let's see how bad things can get
 And I'll drink myself to death!
Or at least I'll drink myself to sleep!
  Chainsmoke my way through the gaps in between
My aspirations and my apathy.
As we drive past the last exit to home I am waving goodbye
And I might be sleeping in the ditch tonight
But it's alright cuz whiskey is my kind of lullaby!
I was sober all morning til I woke up this afternoon
And before someone offered me a job ya know I was gonna get one soon
And everyone in this town sleeps til the calender collides with june,
 Before the booze wears off lets take another shot or two.
 And I'll drink myself to death!
Or at least I'll drink myself to sleep!
  Chainsmoke my way through the gaps in between
My aspirations and my apathy.

  I missed the good times and I realised
  I started looking and the bubble burst
  I started looking for excuses
And the truth is
I miss you
Yeah the truth is
That I miss you so
So I crawl back into your open arms x 4

He said I'm gonna buy this place and burn it down.
I'm gonna put it six feet underground.
He said I'm gonna buy this place and watch it fall.
Stand here beside me baby in the crumbling walls.
Oh I'm gonna buy this place and start a fire.
Stand here until I fill all your hearts desires.
Because I'm gonna buy this place and see it burn.
And do back the things it did to you in return.
Huhuuuuuuh         Huhuuuuuuuuuuuuh
He said I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war.
If you can tell me something worth fighting for.
Oh and I'm goina buy this place is what I said.
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head.
Honey, all the movements you're starting to make.
See me crumble and fall on my face.
And I know the mistakes that I have made.
See it all disappear without trace.
And they call us, they beckon you on.
The said start as you mean to go on. Start as you mean to go on
You said I'm goina buy this place and see it go.
Stand here beside me, baby watch the orange glow.
Some will laugh, some just sit and cry.
But you just sit down there and you wonder why.
So I'm goina buy a gun and start a war.
If you can tell me something worth fighting for.
And I'm goina buy this place is what I said.
Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head, oh to the head.
Honey, all the movements you've started to make.
See me crumble and fall on my face.
And I know the mistakes that I have made.
See it all disappear without trace.
And they call us, they beckon you on.
They said start as you mean to go on. Need to go on      Need to go on.
So meet me by the bridge
Oh meet me by the lane
When am I going to see
That pretty face again
Meet me on the road
Meet me where I said
Blame it all upon
A rush of blood to the head
Come on, oh my star is fading
And I swerve out of control
If I, if I'd only waited
I'd not be stuck here in this hole.
But time is on your side
It's on your side now
Not pushing you down and all around
It's no cause for concern

Kann kaum noch glauben, Gefühle ham sich gedreht
Ich bin viel zu träge, um   aufzugeben
es wär auch zu früh,       weil immer was geht
Wir waren verschworen, wärn füreinander gestorben
haben den Regen gebogen, uns Vertrauen geliehen
Wir haben versucht, auf der Schussfahrt zu wenden
nichts ist zu spät,     aber Vieles zu früh.
Wir haben uns geschoben, durch  alle Gezeiten
haben uns verzettelt, uns verzweifelt geliebt
Wir haben die Wahrheit, so gut es ging verlogen
es war ein Stück vom Himmel,    dass es dich gibt
Du hast den Raum, mit Sonne geflutet
hast jeden Verdruss, ins Gegenteil verkehrt
Nordisch nobel, deine sanftmütige Güte
dein unbändiger Stolz, das Leben ist nicht fair.
Den Film getanzt, in einem silbernen Raum
vom goldnen Balkon, die Unendlichkeit bestaunt
Heillos versunken, trunken, und alles war erlaubt
zusammen im     Zeitraffer, Mittsommernachtstraum
Dein sicherer Gang, deine wahren Gedichte
deine heitere Würde, dein unerschütterliches Geschick 
Du hast der Fügung, deine Stirn geboten
Hast ihn nie verraten, deinen Plan vom Glück
deinen Plan vom Glück
Ich gehe nicht weg, hab meine Frist verlängert
neue Zeitreise,  offene Welt 
Habe dich sicher, in meiner Seele
ich trag dich bei mir,        bis der Vorhang fällt 
Ich trag dich bei mir,      bis der Vorhang fällt

That the emperor put traps in the cage
And the days she being dull
Lead to nights reading beer bottles

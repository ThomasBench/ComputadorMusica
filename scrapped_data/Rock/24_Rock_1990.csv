I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
I never worry, now that is a lie.

Take me to the place I love, take me all the way

And nothing is impossible,In my all powerful mind
It was on the fifth of November, when time it went back
Well some would say that that's impossible,
but you and I we never looked back
And wasn't it incredible, so beautiful and above all
Just to see the fuse get lit this time
To light a real bonfire, for all time
And what a beautiful day (hey hey),I'm the king of all time
And nothing is impossible,In my all powerful mind
I was drinking in my night club,It felt good to be back
When Hepburn said I love you
And Flynn said, make mine a double jack
Was then we planned the revolution,To make things better for all time
And when Guevara said that was crazy,And ordered up a bottle of wine
And what a beautiful day (hey hey),I'm the king of all time(its a beautiful day)
And nothing is impossible,In my all powerful mind
And what a beautiful day (hey hey),I'm the king of all time(its a beautiful day)
And nothing is impossible,In my all powerful mind
In there on the big screen, every night I've seen
The way all things could be
For me, for me, for me, for me
The news broke after midnight,and we pulled the temples down without a sound
But the generals they were hiding out
The ministers, Well! They'd all gone to ground
Wealth re-distribution, became the new solution
So I got a paper bag, and you got the one with all the holes
And what a beautiful day (hey hey),I'm the king of all time(its a beautiful day)
And nothing is impossible,In my all powerful mind
And what a beautiful day (hey hey),I'm the king of all time(its a beautiful day)
And nothing is impossible,In my all powerful mind
Oh yeah and nothing is imposible,in my all powerful mind
Thats because nothing is impossible in my powerful mind

In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself
It wears her out..
It wears her out..

A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

  Make an exception.""I am not worried
  Wrap her up in a package of lies. Send her off to a coconut island
  I am not worried. I am not overly concerned 
  with the status of my emotions. ""Oh,"" she says, ""you're changing.""
  But we're always changing. It does not bother me to say- 
  this isn't love
  Because if you don't want to talk about it then... it isn't love
  And I guess I'm gonna have to live with that
  But I'm sure there's something in a shade of grey
  Or something in between
  And I can always change my name
  If that's what you mean

  Snap her up in a butterfly net

  But then I start to think about the consequences
  Because I don't get no sleepin a quiet room and

A double chin and a plastic smile
Her heart raced as he walked through the door
'My brand new car is parked right outside
How'd you like to go for a ride?' And she said
'Wait a minute, I have to think'
One drink turned into 3 or 4
And they left and got into his car
And they drove away some place real far
Now babe, the time has come
'If we could only please be on our way,
I would not run'
That's when things got out of control
She didn't want to
He had his way
She said let's go
He said no way

Shut your mouth, we're gonna do it my way
Come on baby, don't be afraid

He said 'Now baby, don't be said,'
'In my opinion, you weren't half bad.'
She picked up a rock.
Come on, party people won't you listen to me
Date rape style
The next day, she went to her drawer
Went to the phone and filed a police report
And then she took the guy's ass to court
The day he stood in front of the judge
The judge knew he was full of shit
So he gave him 25 years
And now his heart is filled with tears
One night in jail, it was getting late
And he screamed
But the guards paid no attention to his cries
That's when things got out of control
The moral of the
Date rape story
It does not pay
To be drunk and horny
But that's the way it had to be

Who sees the pain on his face?
He does what he can

What could it possibly mean
For a man who's come this far
Just to turn around
Could there still be life in Kenton's swing
With the Kennedys gone and everything
Those sad rows of houses with their optimistic colors
Democrat grandparents and draft-dodging brothers
Riots down the street and discontented mothers

Somehow he was everything that I am now

And take into its ancient depths
This frail reminder of its giant, dreaming self.
While I, with human-hindered eyes
Unequal to the sweeping curve of life,
Stand on this single print of time.
  Human wheels spin round and round
  While the clock keeps the pace.
  Human wheels spin round and round
  Help the light to my face.
That time, today, no triumph gains
At this short success of age.
This pale reflection of its brave and blundering deed
For I, descend from this vault,
Now dreams beyond my earthly fault
Knowledge, sure, from the seed.

And take into its dark embrace.
This love, who in my beating heart endures,
Assured, by every sun that burns,
The dust to which this flesh shall return.
It is the ancient, dreaming dust of God.
  Human wheels spin round and round
  While the clock keeps the pace.
  Human wheels spin round and round
  Help the light find my face.

 Auf ein neues Jahr
Das Gras war grüner.
Die Linien schneller.
Der Reiz war größer und die Nächte waren länger
Alles Geschichte,
und ich bin froh, daß es so ist.
Oder glaubst Du, es ist schön,
wenn man Scheiße frißt

I walk down every evening and I stand on the shore
   I try to cross to the opposite side
So I can finally find out what I've been looking for

Through the valley of fear to a river so deep
I've been searching for something taken out of my soul
Something I could never lose, something somebody stole
I don't know why I go walking at night
But now I'm tired and I don't wanna walk anymore
I hope it doesn't take the rest of my life
Until I find what it is I've been looking for
In the middle of the night I go walking in my sleep
Through the jungle of doubt to the river so deep
I know I'm searching for something, something so undefined
That it only can be seen by the eyes of the blind
In the middle of the night
   Not sure about a life after this
God knows I've never been a spiritual man
   Baptized by fire, I wade into the river
That is runnin' through the promised land

There's no sense in telling me
The wisdom of a fool won't set you free
But that's the way that it goes
And it's what nobody knows
And every day my confusion grows
Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You'll  say the words that I can't say
  I feel fine and I feel good
I'm feeling like I never should
Whenever I get this way, I just don't know what to say
Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday
I'm not sure what this could mean
I don't think you're what you seem
I do admit to myself
That if I hurt someone else
Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be
Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You'll  say the words that I can't say

Practically floored
One of many zeros
Kicked around bored
Your ears are full, but you're empty
Holding out your heart
To people who never really
Care how you are
So give me Coffee & TV
History
I've seen so much
I'm going blind
And I'm braindead virtually
'Cos Sociability
It's hard enough for me
Take me away from this big bad world
And agree to marry me
So we can start over again
Do you go to the country?
It isn't very far
Those people there will hurt you
'Cos of who you are
Your ears are full of the language
There's wisdom there you're sure
'Til the words start slurring
And you can't find the door

Around the Bay of Biscay and back for tea
Hit traffic on the Dogger Bank
Up the Thames to find a taxi rank
Sail on by with the tide and go to sleep
This is a low, but it won't hurt you
When you're alone, it will be there with you
Finding ways to stay solo
Up the Tyne, Forth and Cromarty
There's a low in the high forties
And Saturday's locked away on the pier
Not fast enough, dear
And on the Malin Head, Blackpool looks blue and red
And the Queen, she's gone 'round the bend
Jumped off Land's End

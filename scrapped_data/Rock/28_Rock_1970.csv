0,Long Long Time (ver 3),Linda Ronstadt,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/linda-ronstadt/long-long-time-chords-1123980,"Love will abide, 
take things in stride
Sounds like good advice but there's no one at my side 
And time washes clean  love's wounds unseen
That's what someone told me but I don't know what it means. 
Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you  for a long long time
Caught in my fears
Blinking back the tears
I can't say you hurt me when you never let me near
And I never drew  one response from you
All the while you fell all over girls you never knew
Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine
And I think it's gonna hurt me  for a long long time
Wait for the day 
You'll go away
Knowing that you warned me of the price I'd have to pay
And life's full of flaws,  who knows the cause? 
Living in the memory of a love that never was 
Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna miss you  for a long long time
Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you  for a long long time

1,Time,David Bowie,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/david-bowie/time-chords-1008486,"Time he's waiting in the wings he speaks of senseless things
His script is you and me boys
Time he flexes like a whore falls wanking to the floor
His trick is you and me, boy
Time in Quaaludes and red wine demanding Billy Dolls
And other friends of mine take your time
The sniper in the brain regurgitating drain
Incestuous and vain and many other last names
I look at my watch it says 9:25 and I think Oh God I'm still alive
We should be on by now
We should be on by now
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
You are not a victim you just scream with boredom
You are not evicting time
Chimes Goddamn you're looking old you'll freeze and catch a cold
'Cause you've left your coat behind take your time
Breaking up is hard but keeping dark is hateful
I had so many dreams I had so many breakthroughs
But you my love were kind but love has left you dreamless
The door to dreams was closed your path was real dreamless
Perhaps you're smiling now smiling through this darkness
But all I had to give was guilt for dreaming
      We should be on by now        We should be on by now

2,Spirit In The Night (ver 2),Bruce Springsteen,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bruce-springsteen/spirit-in-the-night-chords-865570,"Crazy Janey and her mission man were back in the alley tradin' hands
`Long came Wild Billy with his friend G-man all duded up for Saturday night
Billy slammed on his coaster brakes and said anybody would wanna go on up to 
Greasy Lake    It's about a mile down on the dark side of Route 88
I got a bottle of rose so let's try it     We'll pick up Hazy Davy 
and Killer Joe and I'll take you all out to where the gypsy angels go
They're built like light
Oooh and they dance like spirits in the night (all night) in the night (all night)
Oh you don't know what they can do to you
Spirits in the night (all night), in the night (all night)
Stand right up now and let it shoot through you
Well now Wild young Billy was a crazy cat and he shook some dust out of his 
coonskin cap.       He said, ""Trust some of this it'll show you where you're at, 
or at least it'll help you really feel it""
By the time we made it up to Greasy Lake I had my head out the window and Janey's 
fingers were in the cake    I think I really dug her cause I was too loose to fake
I said, ""I'm hurt"" she said, ""Honey let me heal it""
And we danced all night to a soul fairy band
and she kissed me just right like only a lonely angel can
She felt so nice, just as soft as a spirit in the night (all night)
In the night (all night) Janey don't know what she do to you
Like a spirit in the night (all night) all night (all night)
Stand right up and let her shoot through you
Ooooooh Ooooooh       Ooooooh Ooooooh
Now the night was bright and the stars threw light on Billy and Davy dancin' in the moonlight
They were down near the water in a stone mud fight
Killer Joe gone passed out on the lawn
Well now Hazy Davy got really hurt, he ran into the lake in just his socks and a shirt
Me and Crazy Janey was makin' love in the dirt singin' our birthday songs
Janey said it was time to go
So we closed our eyes and said goodbye to gypsy angel row, felt so right
Together we moved like spirits in the night (all night) in the night (all night)
Baby don't know what they do to you
Them spirits in the night (all night) in the night (all night)
Stand right up and let it shoot through you
Like a spirit in the night (all night) all night (all night)
All night (all night) all the night (all night)

 I was feeling something wasn't right
 There was not another soul in sight
 Only you, only you
 So we walked along,
 though I knew that there was something wrong
 And the feeling hit me oh so strong about you
 Then you gazed up at me and the an__swer was plain to see
 'Cause I saw the light in your eyes________in your eyes
 Though we had our fling
 I just ne__ver would suspect a thing
 'Til that little bell began to ring in my head, in my head
 But I tried to run, 
 though I knew it wouldn't help me none
 'Cause I couldn't ever love no one, or so I said
 But my feelings for you were just something I never knew
 'Til I saw the light in your eyes________in your eyes
 But I love you best
 It's not something that I say in jest
 'Cause you're different girl from all the rest, in my eyes
 And I ran out before but I won't do it anymore

 in my eyes________in my eyes (Repeat * once more)

drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles

So we'll argue and we'll compromise, and realize that nothing's ever changed
For all our mutual experience, our separate conclusions are the same
Now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity
Our reason coexists with our insanity

On the first part of the journey,
I was looking at all the life,
There were plants, and birds, and rocks, and things,
There were sand, and hills, and rings!
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz,
And the sky ...with no clouds,
The heat was hot, and the ground was dry,
But the air was full of sound!
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name,
It felt good to be out of the rain,
In the desert     ...you can re - member your name,
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La ---, la---,  la-la, la, la!

After two days   ...in the desert sun,
My skin be - gan to turn red,
After three days  ...in the desert fun,
I was looking at a river bed,
And the story it told, of a river that flowed,
Made me sad to think it was dead
You see, I've been through the desert on a horse with no name,
It felt good to be out of the rain,
In the desert    ...you can re - member your name,

And the perfect dis - guise a - bove,
Under the cities  ...lies a heart made of ground,

And everybody's in movies, it doesn't matter who you are.
There are stars in every city,
In every house and on every street,
And if you walk down Hollywood Boulevard
Their names are written in concrete!
Don't step on Greta Garbo as you walk down the boulevard,
She looks so weak and fragile that's why she tried to be so hard
But they turned her into a princess
And they sat her on a throne,
But she turned her back on stardom,
Because she wanted to be alone.
You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard,
Some that you recognize, some that you've hardly even heard of,
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame,
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain.
Rudolph Valentino, looks very much alive,
And he looks up ladies  dresses as they sadly pass him by.
Avoid stepping on Bela Lugosi
cos he’s liable to turn and bite,
But stand close by Bette Davis
Because hers was such a lonely life.
If you covered him with garbage,
George Sanders would still have style,
And if you stamped on Mickey Rooney
He would still turn round and smile,
But please don't tread on dearest Marilyn
cos she's not very tough,
She should have been made of iron or steel,
But she was only made of flesh and blood.
You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard,
Some that you recognize, some that you've hardly even heard of,
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame,
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain.
Everybody's a dreamer and everybody's a star
And everybody's in show biz, it doesn't matter who you are.
And those who are successful,
Be always on your guard,
Success walks hand in hand with failure
Along Hollywood Boulevard.
I wish my life was a non-stop Hollywood movie show,
A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes,
Because celluloid heroes never feel any pain
And celluloid heroes never really die.
You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard,

Oh celluloid heroes never really die.

Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand

Lo lo lo lo Lola,   Lo lo lo lo Lola
Well we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
Well I'm not the world's most passionate guy
but when I looked in her eye, well I almost fell for my Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola,   Lo lo lo lo Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola,   Lo lo lo lo Lola
I pushed her away
I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
I got down on my knees
Then I looked at her and she at me
Well that's the way that I want it to stay
and I always want it to be that way for my Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola
Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up, muddled up, shook up world except for Lola
Lo lo lo lo Lola
Well I left home just a week before
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
Lola smiled and took me by the hand
Well I'm not the worlds most passionate man
but I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man and so is Lola,

In my time, in my time, I will roll, roll, roll
In a bed, in a bed
By the waterside I will lay my head
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul
River gonna take me, sing me sweet and sleepy
Sing me sweet and sleepy all the way back home

Going home, going home
By the waterside I will rest my bones

Going to plant a weeping willow
On the bank's green edge it will grow, grow, grow
Singing a lullaby beside the water
Lovers come and go, the river will roll, roll, roll

When you sat down and cried on the stairs
You knew it did not cost the earth, but for what it's worth
You made me feel a millionaire

Anyway, my coffee's cold and I'm getting told

46,South City Midnight Lady,The Doobie Brothers,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-doobie-brothers/south-city-midnight-lady-chords-15117,"Up all night I could not sleep
The whiskey that I drank was cheap
With shakin' hands I wait and I lit up my last cigarette
Well the sun came the night had fled
And sleepy-eyed I reached my bed
I saw you sleepy dreamin there all covered and warm
South city midnight lady
I'm much obliged indeed
You sure have saved this man whose soul was in need
I thought there was no reason
For all these things I do
But the smile that I sent out returned with you
When day has left the night behind
And shadows roll across my mind
I sometimes find myself alone and out walking the street
Yes and when I'm feelin' down and blue
Then all I do is think of you
And all my foolish problems seem to fade away
South city midnight lady
I'm much obliged indeed
You sure have saved this man whose soul was in need
I thought there was no reason
For all these things I do
But the smile that I sent out returned with you
South city midnight lady

Silver hair a ragged shirt and baggy pants         the old sof' shoe
He jumped so high       jumped so high     and then he'd lightly touch down
I met him in a cell in New Orleans, I was     down and out
He looked to me to be the eyes of age        as the smoke ran out
He talked of life     he talked of life    laughed, clicked his heels and stepped
He said his name Bojangles and he danced a lick       across the cell
He grabbed his pants and featherd stance for he jumped so high      then he 
clicked his heels      He let go a laugh    let go a laugh     shook back 
his clothes all around
   Mr. Bojangles
   Mr. Bojangles
   Mr. Bojangles    Dance
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs     throughout the south
He spoke through tears of fifteen years how his dog and him     traveled about
The dog up and died      he up and died     after twenty years he still grieves
He said I dance now at every chance in honky-tonks    for drinks and tips
But most the time I spend behind these county bars,   'cause I drinks a bit
   He shook his head and as he shook his head      I heard someone ask 
him please, please

48,On The Border,Al Stewart,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/al-stewart/on-the-border-chords-85317,"                The fishing boats go out across the evening water
                Smuggling guns and arms across the Spanish border
                The winds whip up the waves so loud
                The ghost moon sails among the clouds
                And turns the rifles into silver on the border
                On my wall the colours of the maps are running
                From Africa the winds they talk of changes coming
                The torches flair up in the night
                The hand that sets the farms alight
                Has spread the word to those who're waiting on the border
                In the vllage where I grew up
                Nothing seems the same
                But still you never see the change from day to day
                And no one notices the customs slip away
                Late last night the rain was knocking on my window
                I moved across the darkened room and in the lampglow
                I thought I saw down in the street
                The spirit of the century
                Telling us that we're all standing on the border
                In the islands where I grew up
                Nothing seems the same
                It's just the patterns that remain an empty shell
                But there's a strangeness in the air 
                You feel too well
                The fishing boats go out across the evening water
                Smuggling guns and arms across the Spanish border
                The winds whip up the waves so loud
                The ghost moon sails among the clouds
                And turns the rifles into silver on the border
                On the border
                On the border
                On the border

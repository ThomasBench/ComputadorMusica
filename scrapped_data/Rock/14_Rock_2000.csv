Cuz he's not with anyone
She came falling to screaming skies
The answer’s no, it's just too high
Laputa was all we knew and
How we got there, how we flew up
Heaven's doors are miles away
Cause you’re stuck to the ground, you have to stay
The robots, died in our flames
The robots, died of it, yes
Laputa was all we knew and
How we got there, how we flew up
Heaven's doors are miles away
Cause you’re stuck to the ground, you have to stay

1,Dont Forget Me,Red Hot Chili Peppers,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/red-hot-chili-peppers/dont-forget-me-chords-34382,"   I'm an ocean  in your bedroom
   Make you feel warm, make you wanna re-assume
   Now we know it all for sure.
   I'm a dancehall, dirty breakbeat
   make the snow fall up from underneath your feet.
   Not alone, I'll be there, tell me when you wanna go!
   I'm a meth lab, first rehab
   Take it all off and step inside the running cab
   There's a love that knows the way
   I'm the rainbow in your jail cell
   All the memories of everything you've ever smelled.
   Not alone, I'll be there, tell me when you wanna go!
Sideways falling, more will be revealed my friend
  Don't forget me, I can't hide it
   Come again get me excited
   I'm an inbred and a pothead
   Two legs that you spread inside a tool shed
   Now we know it all for sure.
   I could show you to the free field
   Overcome and more will always be revealed
   Not alone, I'll be there, tell me when you wanna go!
Sideways falling, more will be revealed my friend
   Don't forget me, I can't hide it
   Come again get me excited
Sideways falling, more will be revealed my friend
   Don't forget me, I can't hide it
there's a match now let me let me light it
   I'm the bloodstain on your shirtsleeve
   Coming down and more are coming to believe.
   Now we know it all for sure.
   Make the hair stand up on your arm
   Teach you how to dance inside the funny farm
   Not alone, I'll be there, tell me when you wanna go.
I'll be there, tell me when you wanna go
come on then and tell me when you want to go
more will be revealed my friend

I'll be here wondering
Did you get what you deserve?
The ending of your life and if you get to heaven
I'll be here waiting, babe
Did you get what you deserve?
The end, and if your life wont wait
Then your heart can't take this
Have you heard the news that you're dead?
No one ever had much nice to say
I think they never liked you anyway
Oh take me from the hospital bed
Wouldn't it be grand? It ain't exactly what you planned.
And wouldn't it be great
If we were dead?
Ohh dead.
Tongue-tied and oh so squeamish
You never fell in love
Did you get what you deserve?
The ending of your life
And if you get to heaven
I'll be here waiting, babe
Did you get what you deserve?
The end, and if your life won't wait
Then your heart can't take this

I think they never liked you anyway
Oh take me from the hospital bed
Wouldn't it be grand to take a pistol by the hand?
And wouldn't it be great
If we were dead?
And in my honest observation
During this operation
Found a complication in your heart
So long, 'cause now you've got (now you've got)
Maybe just 2 weeks to live
Is that the most the both of you can give?

I'm through with standing in line to clubs we'll never get in
It's like the bottom of the ninth and I'm never gonna win
This life hasn't turned out quite the way I want it to be
I want a brand new house on an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough for ten plus me
I'll need a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club at thirty seven thousand feet
I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me
I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name
'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs
So I can eat my meals for free
I'm gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves
To blow my money for me
I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name
'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny with her bleach blond hair
And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary and today's who's who
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial and
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
I'm gonna sing those songs that offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills from a pez dispenser
I'll get washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip sync 'em every night so I don't get 'em wrong
Well, we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat

A simple note for you, I'll wait for your reply

We will rip the night 
Out of the arms of the sun one more time 
Close your eyes and we will fly
Above the clouded sky 
And over the dumbstruck world we will run 
In these hills they wash the golden grains away 
To the valley under all of this I lay 
And may you dig me out unearthed and saved 
So hover in the diving light
We will rip the night 
Out of the arms of the sun one more time 
Close your eyes and we will fly
Above the clouded sky 
And over the dumbstruck world we will run

Out of the arms of the sun
A blood red feather leaves a scar upon my hand 
No longer stranded like a painted bird on a fan

Close your eyes and we will fly
Above the clouded sky 
And over the dumbstruck world we will run

 Quando ti guardo Dopo un giorno pieno di parole
 Senza che tu mi dica niente Tutto si fa chiaro
 A te che mi hai trovato All’angolo coi pugni chiusi
 Con le mie spalle contro il muro Pronto a difendermi
 Con gli occhi bassi Stavo in fila Con i disillusi
 Tu mi hai raccolto Come un gatto E mi hai portato con te
 A te io canto una canzone Perchè non ho altro
 Niente di meglio da offrirti Di tutto quello che ho
 Prendi il mio tempo E la magìa Che con un solo salto
 Ci fa volare dentro l’aria Come bollicine
 A te che sei Semplicemente sei
Sostanza dei giorni miei
Sostanza dei giorni miei
 A te che sei il mio grande amore Ed il mio amore grande
 A te che hai preso la mia vita E ne hai fatto molto di più
 A te che hai dato senso al tempo Senza misurarlo
 A te che sei il mio amore grande Ed il mio grande amore
 A te che io Ti ho visto piangere nella mia mano
 Fragile che potevo ucciderti stringendoti un po’
 E poi ti ho visto Con la forza di un aeroplano
 Prendere in mano la tua vita E trascinarla in salvo
 A te che mi hai insegnato i sogni E l’arte dell’avventura
 A te che credi nel coraggio  E anche nella paura
 A te che sei la miglior cosa Che mi sia successa
 A te che cambi tutti i giorni E resti sempre la stessa
 A te che sei Semplicemente sei

Sostanza dei sogni miei

 Sei l’orizzonte che mi accoglie quando mi allontano
 A te che sei l’unica amica Che io posso avere
 L’unico amore che vorrei Se io non ti avessi con me

 Che riesci a render la fatica Un immenso piacere

oder malochen bei Blohm & Voss,
Nee irgendwie, das war doch klar,
irgendwann da wohn ich da,
In der Präsidentensuite,
wos nicht reinregnet und nicht zieht,
und was bestell ich dann?
Dosenbier und Kaviar

und wenn auch jeder sagt du spinnst,
du wirst es genauso bringen,
machst auf die charmante Art
mal elastisch, manchmal hart,
manchmal musst du das Glück auch zwingen

Er ist sich immer treu geblieben,
die Mode kam die Mode ging,
und man war immer noch der King.

You can't change the state of the nation
We just need some motivation
Since I have seen no conviction
Just lies and more contradiction

I'd say its up, to me

We're the first ones to jump in line
Out of step for what we believe in
But whos left? To start the pleading
How far will we take this
It's not hard to see through the thickness
So tell me what would you say

En su brazo dobladita con cuidado la chaqueta

Escogiste a la más guapa y a la menos buena
Sin saber como ha venido te ha cogido la tormenta

Que tenía los ojos verdes y un negocio entre las piernas

It's the only place I honestly
Can get myself some peace of mind
You know it's getting hard to fly
If I'm to fall
Would you be there to applaud?
Or would you hide behind them all?
Cos if I have to go
In my heart you grow
And that's where you belong
If I'm to fall
Would you be there to applaud?
Or would you hide behind them all?
Cos if I have to go
In my heart you grow
And that's where you belong
If I'm to fall
Would you be there to applaud?
Or would you hide behind them all?
Cos if I have to go
In my heart you grow
And that's where you belong
Guess I'm outta time
I'm outta time
I'm outta time
I'm outta time
I'm outta time

46,She Will Be Loved,Maroon 5,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/maroon-5/she-will-be-loved-chords-202672,"   Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
   He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else
   I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door...
    I've had you so many times but
Somehow I want more...
  I don't mind spending every day
  Out on your corner in the pouring rain...
 Look for the girl with the broken smile
  Ask her if she wants to stay awhile...
And she will... be loved
 She will be loved....
  Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
  I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore
   It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along
  My heart is full and my door's always open
   You can come anytime you want
  I don't mind spending every day
  Out on your corner in the pouring rain...
 Look for the girl with the broken smile
  Ask her if she wants to stay awhile...
And she will... be loved
 She will be loved...
   I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
 I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls...
   I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
 I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls...

Sur la Terre en toute saison, moi je tourne en rond, je tourne en rond
Je suis un seul puis des millions, je suis un homme au coeur de lion
A la guerre en toute saison, moi je tourne en rond, je tourne en rond
Je suis un homme plein d'ambition, belle voiture et belle maison
Dans la chambre, dans le salon, moi je tourne en rond, je tourne en rond
Je fais l'amour et la révolution, je fais le tour de la question
J'avance, avance à reculons, oui je tourne en rond, je tourne en rond
Tu vois, j'suis pas un homme, je suis le roi de l'illusion
Au fond, qu'on me pardonne, je suis le roi, le roi des cons
J'ai fait le monde à ma façon, coulé dans l'or et le béton
Corps en cage, coeur en prison, moi je tourne en rond, je tourne en rond
Assis devant ma télévision, je suis de l'Homme, la négation
Pur produit de consommation, oui mon compte est bon, mon compte est bon
Tu vois, j'suis pas un homme, je suis le roi de l'illusion
Au fond, qu'on me pardonne, je suis le roi, le roi des cons
C'est moi, le maître du feu
Le maître du jeu, le maître du Monde
Et vois ce que j'en ai fait
Une Terre glacée, une Terre brûlée
La Terre des hommes que les hommes abandonnent
Je suis un homme au pied du mur, comme une erreur de la nature
Sur la Terre sans d'autres raisons, moi je tourne en rond, je tourne en rond
Je suis un homme et je mesure, toute l'horreur de ma nature
Pour ma peine, ma punition, moi je tourne en rond, je tourne en rond
Je suis un homme et je mesure, toute l'horreur de ma nature
Pour ma peine, ma punition, moi je tourne en rond, je tourne en rond
Moi je tourne en rond, je tourne en rond
En rond

Far from all the things that we are
Puts on a smile and breathes it in and
breathes it out, He says bye bye,
bye to all the noise
Oh, he says bye bye,
bye to all the noise
Doo doo doo doo doo noo noo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Hey child, things are looking down, that's okay,
you don't need to win anyways
Don't be afraid, just eat up all the grey
Don't let yourself fall down
Doo doo doo doo doo noo noo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

She never had it all
One Prozac a day
Husband's a CPA
Her dreams went out the door
When she turned 24
Only been with one man
What happened to her plan?
She was gonna be an actress
She was gonna be a star 
She was gonna shake her ass(ass)
On the hood of White Snake's car
Her yellow SUV is now the enemy
Looks at her average life
And nothing, has been...
Bruce Springsteen, Madonna
Way before Nirvana (1985)
There was U2 and Blondie
And music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school
They tell her that she's uncool
Cuz she's still preoccupied

Woo Hoo Hooooo!  (1985)
Woo Hoo Hooooo!
She’s seen all the classics
She knows every line
""Breakfast Club"", ""Pretty In Pink""
Even ""St. Elmo's Fire""
She rocked out to Wham!
Not a big Limp Bizkit fan
Thought she'd get a hand
On a member of Duran Duran
Where's the mini-skirt made of snakeskin?
And who's the other guy that's singing in Van Halen?
When did reality become TV?
What ever happened to sitcoms, game shows,

And when did Ozzy become an actor?

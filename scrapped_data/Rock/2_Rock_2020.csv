0,Seventeen Going Under (ver 2),Sam Fender,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/sam-fender/seventeen-going-under-chords-3785126,"I   remember the sickness was forever
I     remember snuff videos
Cold Septembers
The fist fights on the  beach
The Bizzies round us up
Do it all again next week
The first time that it scarred
Embarrass yourself for someone
Crying like a child
Still bugs me now
That’s the thing it lingers
And claws you when you’re down
I was far too scared to hit him
But I would hit him in a heartbeat now
That’s the thing with anger
It begs to stick around
And leave you spent with nowt to offer
It makes you hurt the ones who love you
You hurt them like they’re nothing
oh oo wuh ah uh oh ah oh
You hurt them like they’re nothing
oh oo wuh ah uh oh ah oh
oh oo wuh ah uh oh ah oh
See I spent my teens enraged
Spiralling in silence
And I armed myself with a grin
Cause I was always the fuckin' joker
Buried in their humour
Amongst the white noise and boys' boys
Locker room talkin' lads' lads
Drenched in cheap drink and snide fags
Oh God the kid’s a dab hand
Canny chanter, but he looks sad
God, the kid looks so sad
God, the kid looks so sad
She said the debt, the debt, the debt
And how she wept and wept and wept
Luck came and died round here
I see my mother
She cries on the floor   encumbered
I’m seventeen going under
I’m seventeen going under
oh oo wuh   ah oh uh oh
I’m seventeen going under
uh-oh
oh oo wuh   ah oh uh oh
I’m seventeen going under

I’m seventeen going under

To let somebody go

Everything that we went through
Now without you, what on earth am I to do?
When I called the mathematicians and
I asked them to explain
They said love is only equal to the pain
And when everything was going wrong
You could turn my sorrow into song

A pretty line that I adore
Five words that I've heard before
'Cause you keep me on a rope
And tied a noose around my throat
You're gone then back at my door
'Cause if you're gonna leave, better leave, better do it fast
Can't live a little longer sitting on your lap
'Cause you know what you're doin' when you're comin' back
And I don't wanna have another heart attack
Every other week, when you please
Oh, I can't be the kiss that you don't need
The lie between your teeth
The cut that always bleeds
(Ah-ah-ah)
The cut that always bleeds
(Ah-ah-ah)
Say you love somebody new
Then beat my heart to black and blue
Then they leave, and it's me you come back to (Ah-ah)
To say you loved me all along
And kiss the bruises 'til they're gone
Bittersweet, 'cause I can't breathe inside your arms
'Cause if you're gonna leave, better leave, better do it fast
Can't live another minute bleedin' from my back
'Cause I don't have another one for you to stab
And I don't wanna have another heart attack
Every other week, when you please

The lie between your teeth
The cut that always bleeds

The cut that always bleeds

(Ooh-ooh-ooh) I need you like the air I breathe
I need, I need you more than me
I need you more than anything
Please, please
'Cause I could be your lover on a leash
Every other week, when you please
Oh, I could be anything you need
As long as you don't leave

An eloquent part of the whole dance

Tell the whole world to roll down

The criminal ties of my rival

Cold supply, scraping to get by
Blatantly flooding the low rise
And I'll throw this dice

Tell me it's part of the program I started
Space me now through your citizens
Tell me it's part of the whole plan now
Bringing my slow hand

We do not fight for war

Replaced by apathy and dating apps
You held his hands, it felt like flying

It's kinda short, kinda boring, but the end is a whirl
They were just sixteen when the people were mean
So they didn't love themselves, and now they're gone
Headstones on a lawn
And when I was younger, I knew a boy and a boy
Best friends with each other, but always wished they were more
'Cause they loved one another, but never discovered
'Cause they were too afraid of what they'd say
Moved to different states
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
But I think that it could work for you and me
Just wait and see
It's not the end of the story
Now it's on to the sequel about me and my friend
Both our parents were evil, so we both made a bet
If we worked and we saved, we could both run away
And we'd have a better life, and I was right
I wonder if she's alright
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
But I think that it could work for you and me
Just wait and see
It's not the end of the story
Okay
And the movie's always runnin' in my head
All the people, all the lovers, all my friends
And I hope that they all get their happy end
In the end
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet

Footsteps down familiar sidewalks

I know you feel them too
Riding shotgun next to your free slurpie
They know all of my habits
But they don't know about you
I hope that's true
Mmm, mmm, mmn
We made sangria and failed
I spilled mac n cheese on my pants
And thought about kissing you underneath kitchen lights
Oh all my ghosts are with me
I know you feel them too
Oh they just stand there while we're taking shots of brandy
They know all of my habits
But they don't know about you

Eat my pie

Midnight calls
Sunset views

So you never made nice with the locals
But you tied me up slow with your vine stuff
It takes a few years, but they break bones
It takes a few months, but our bones heal
We’re stronger, and we tell all our school friends
And they sign our cast in the playground
Darling, the rest of my body, it’s yours, then
I know you're scared
Well, I’m scared too
Oh, that every time I try to makе lunch
For anyone else, in my hеad
I end up dreaming of you and you come to me
Good morning
Show me the place where he inserted the blade
I’ll praise the Lord, burn my house
I get lost, I freak out
You come home and hold me tight
As if it never happened at all
Good morning
Show me the place where he inserted the blade
Good morning
Where is your light?
Am I home? I will hold to my chest where the wind can exist
I will try
Not to keep you too long
So, clean your soup-maker and breathe in
Your chicken, broccoli, and everything
The tug that’s between us, that long string
Concorde, Bound 2, and my evening
The good hunter’s guide to a bad night
Darlin’, I’ll spoil it myself, thanks, you’re leaving
Well, I tried just to stroke your dreams better
But, darlin’, I see that you’re not really sleeping
And I know you’re tired
Well, I’m tired too
Oh, that every time I try to make lunch
For anyone else, in my head
I end up dreaming of you and you come to me
Good morning
Show me the place where he inserted the blade
I’ll praise the Lord, burn my house
I get lost, I freak out
You come home and hold me tight
As if it never happened at all
Good morning
Show me the fifth or the cadence you want me to play
Good morning
Show me where to tie the other end of this chain

Wishing they could wash your hair

And your toothbrush at my bathroom sink
Your cellphone chargers still hanging from the wall
Haven’t chucked it all, like you’d think
Though you haven’t been around in weeks
  I’ve run out of my speed stick honey
So I have been using yours
Its frickin trash all that Organic hoo hah
From one of your health food stores
It is seemingly worsened everyday
All this shit of yours around my house
If I could’ve had it any other way
Then by now I would’ve chucked it out
But it seems to wanna stick around.

Though I’d love to catch a pass
  Waited long enough that I could never call you
Baby how fucked is that
And it’s all just so forgettable
Til I’m sitting with your stuff alone
Man why can’t I just let it go
  I’ve been seeing that red corolla parked out on the corner there
If it were yours there’d be some hippie bull shit hanging from the rear-view mirror
As I’m passing it every other day
I look in to see if this one’s yours
But the shape it’s in is giving it away
Yours is dented up and down the doors
Never wanted to see it more

Sappi che era un'illusione ottica
Stavo solo togliendo il mare dai miei occhi
Perché ogni tanto per andare avanti sai, avanti sai
Bisogna lasciar perdere i vecchi ricordi
Mi chiedi come sto e non te lo dirò
Il nostro vecchio gioco era di non parlare mai
Come due serial killer interrogati all'FBI
I tuoi segreti poi a chi li racconterai
Tu che rimani sempre la mia password del wi-fi
E chi sa se lo sai
Per favore non piangere
E non ci rimanere malе
Che noi due ci conosciamo benе
Dalla prima elementare
E scrivevo tutti i miei segreti
Col pastello bianco sul diario
Speravo che venissi a colorarli
E ti giuro sto ancora aspettando
E se m'hai visto ridere
Sappi che era neve nel deserto ma
Ormai di questi tempi non mi stupisce niente
Mi chiedo come stai e non me lo dirai
Io con la coca cola, tu con la tisana thai
Perché un addio suona troppo serio
Seduti dentro un bar poi si litigherà
Per ogni cosa pure per il conto da pagare
Lo sai mi mancherà
Per favore non piangere
E non ci rimanere malе
Che noi due ci conosciamo benе
Dalla prima elementare
E scrivevo tutti i miei segreti
Col pastello bianco sul diario
Speravo che venissi a colorarli
E ti giuro sto ancora aspettando
   Tu mi hai insegnato la differenza tra le ciliege e le amarene
E io non la dimenticherò più
   E ti auguro il meglio, i cieli stellati, le notti migliori e le docce di altri
Dove tu forse non stonerai più
Per favore non piangere
E non ci rimanere malе
Che noi due ci conosciamo benе
Dalla prima elementare
E scrivevo tutti i miei segreti
Col pastello bianco sul diario
Speravo che venissi a colorarli

There must be more to this

Let's book a holiday
'Cause we're already boring
What else have we got left to accrue?
And the ramblers will say:
""It's got a marvellous view""

Thеy'll never know what you knew

And we're so calm but we're (fucking scared, fucking scared)
And we're so calm but we're fucking scared of people like you
Under the weight of some Sertraline
A couple Prozacs and now I'm pumping dopamine
      There must be more to this
We've got a country house now
It's nice to be around trees
Custom licence plate
How many grocers does one county need?
And the ramblers will say:
""It's still a marvellous view""
But the treadmill still looms
Of your hedonic misuse
So come on, one and all and see the apathy
The reems of grey stencils that fill the tapestry
I look to all of you and see a different fucking species
Aspiration for a different destination to me
Across the Pennines there's a thin blue line, a knife and a mall
I would do something if it wasn't all so effortful
'Cause I'm so high my brain can't even look at the fall
And when you've reached the top, there's nowhere else to go but...

Call me when you want, or just call me when you need it
If you only ever need it for the day
High won't hold, won't hold, and I have no more, than all you left of me
I have, I have, I have no more, than all you leave

Not a word from me, at least nothing you would mind

Feeling fine, coming down, never back cause we're never out
You'll never call the cops again, I'll never call her mine
In my head, in my head, I get lonely sometimes
When you find an old picture of us, and you clear away the dust
I hope you miss me sometimes
When you see a frame that reminds you of me, would you remember the times,
oh the times that we believed
In a Cocaine Jesus in a black four-seater,
got a man, don't need him, but you wait

You win a lot, and lose just a little bit more than you gained in the end
God, I wish that I, was better than I am, but no luck, no love, no Gospel I could understand
I'm nothing that ever wanted to lean on, yea, but even then

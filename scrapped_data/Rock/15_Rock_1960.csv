with the barkers and the colored balloons,
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
tho' you're thinkin' that you're leavin' there too soon,
you're leavin' there too soon.
It's so noisy at the fair
but all your friends are there
And the candy floss you had
and your mother and your dad.
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
with the barkers and the colored balloons,
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
tho' you're thinkin' that you're leavin' there too soon,
you're leavin' there too soon.
There's a girl just down the aisle,
oh, to turn and see her smile.
You can hear the words she wrote
as you read the hidden note.
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
with the barkers and the colored balloons,
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
tho' you're thinkin' that you're leavin' there too soon,
you're leavin' there too soon.
Now you're underneath the stairs
and you're givin' back some glares
To the people who you met
and it's your first cigarette.
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
with the barkers and the colored balloons,
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
tho' you're thinkin' that you're leavin' there too soon,
you're leavin' there too soon.
Now you say you're leavin' home
'cause you want to be alone.
Ain't it funny how you feel
When you're findin' out it's real?
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
with the barkers and the colored balloons,
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
tho' you're thinkin' that you're leavin' there too soon,
you're leavin' there too soon.
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
with the barkers and the colored balloons,
You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain

I got to go for a Sunday drive.
Sunday morning woke up yawning, filled the pool for a swim.
Hold down the glass and looked in the mirror, just to see if I was in.
Went up the stairs and kissed my women,  to make her come a-live.
'Cause with an orphanage full of thirty-five kids,
I got to go for a Sunday drive.
An orphanage full of thirty-five kids,

Because I love you too much baby 
Why can't you see, 
what you're doing to me? 
When you don't believe a word I say? 
We can't go on together 
With suspicious minds 
And we can't build our dreams 
On suspicious minds 
So, if an old friend I know 
Drops by to say hello 
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes? 
Here we go again 
Asking where I've been 
You can't see these tears are real I'm crying 
We can't go on together 
With suspicious minds 
And we can't build our dreams 
On suspicious minds 
Oh let our love survive 
Or dry the tears from your eyes 
Let's don't let a good thing die 
When honey, you know 
I've never lied to you 
Mmm yeah, yeah
We're caught in a trap 
I can't walk out 
Because I love you too much baby

what you're doing to me?

It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me
Let me take you down, cos I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about

No one I think is in my tree,        I mean it must be high or low
That is, you can't you know tune in but it's all right
That is, I think it's not too bad 
Let me take you down, cos I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about

Always know, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think a ""no"" will be a ""yes"", but it's all wrong
That is, I think I disagree

Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about

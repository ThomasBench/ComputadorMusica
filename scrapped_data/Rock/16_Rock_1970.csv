Yet every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here.
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east.
Any day now,
Any day now,
I   shall be released
They say every man needs protection.
They say every man must fall.
Yet I swear I see my reflection,
Somewhere so high above the wall.
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east.
Any day now,
Any day now,
I   shall be released
Well yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd,
A man who swears he not to blame.
All day long I hear him cry shouting loud,
Calling out that he's been framed.
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east.
Any day now,
Any day now,
I   shall be released

37,Elegia,Vesa-Matti Loiri,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/vesa-matti-loiri/elegia-chords-1705154,"Haihtuvi nuoruus, niinkuin vierivä virta.
Langat jo harmaat lyö elon kultainen pirta.
Turhaan, oi turhaan tartun mä hetkehen kiinni;
riemua ei suo rattoisa seura, ei viini.
Häipyvät taakse tahtoni ylpeät päivät.
Henkeni hurmat ammoin jo jälkehen jäivät.
Notkosta nousin. Taasko on painua tieni?
Toivoni ainoo: tuskaton tuokio pieni.
Tiedän ma: rauha mulle on mullassa suotu.
Etsijän tielle ei lepo lempeä luotu,
pohjoinen puhuu, myrskyhyn aurinko vaipuu,
jää punajuova: kauneuden voimaton kaipuu.
Upposi mereen unteni kukkivat kunnaat.
Mies olen köyhä: kalliit on laulujen lunnaat.
Kaikkeni annoin, hetken mä heilua jaksoin,
haavehen kullat mieleni murheella maksoin.
Uupunut olen, ah, sydänjuurihin saakka!
Liikaako lienee pantukin paatinen taakka?
Tai olen niitä, joilla on tahto, ei voima?
Voittoni tyhja, työn tulos tuntoni soima.
Siis oli suotta kestetyt, vaikeat vaivat,
katkotut kahleet, poltetut, rakkahat laivat?
Nytkö ma kaaduin, kun oli kaikkeni tarpeen?
Jähmetyn jääksi, kun meni haavani arpeen?
Toivoton taisto taivaan valtoja vastaan!
Kaikuvi kannel; lohduta laulu ei lastaan.
Hallatar haastaa, soi sävel sortuvin siivin.
Rotkoni rauhaan kuin peto kuoleva hiivin.

You are the sunlight in my growing - so little warmth I've felt before.
It isn't hard to feel me glowing - I watched the fire that grew so low.
It is the summer of my smiles - flee from me Keepers of the Gloom.
Speak to me only with your eyes. It is to you I give this tune.
Ain't so hard to recognize - These things are clear to all from
Time to time.
Talk Talk - I've felt the coldness of my winter
I never thought it would ever go. I cursed the gloom that set upon us...
But I know that I love you so
But I know that I love you so
These are the seasons of emotion and like the winds they rise and fall
This is the wonder of devotion - I see the torch we all must hold.
This is the mystery of the quotient - Upon us all a little rain must fall

and you're feeling cold and small

44,Isis,Bob Dylan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bob-dylan/isis-chords-927813,"I married Isis on the fifth day of May
But I could not hold on to her very long
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong.
I came to a high place of darkness and light
The dividing line ran through the center of town
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.
A man in the corner approached me for a match
I knew right away he was not ordinary
He said ""Are you looking for something easy to catch ?""
I said ""I got no money"". He said ""That ain't necessary"".
We set out that night for the cold in the North
I gave him my blanket he gave me his word
I said ""Where are we going ?"" He said ""We'd be back by the fourth""
I said ""That's the best news that I've ever heard"".
I was thinking about turquoise I was thinking about gold
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace
As we rode through the canyons through the devilish cold
I was thinking about Isis how she thought I was so reckless.
How she told me that one day we will meet up again
And things would be different the next time we wed
If I only could hang on and just be her friend
I still can't remember all the best things she said.
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice
He said ""There's a body I'm trying to find
If I carry it out it'll bring a good price""
It was then that I knew what he had on his mind.
The wind it was howling and the snow was outrageous
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn
When he died I was hoping that it wasn't contagious
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.
I broke into the tomb but the casket was empty
There was no jewels no nothing I felt I'd been had
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly
When I took up his offer I must-a been mad.
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes
I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead.
She said ""Where ya been ?"" I said ""No place special""
She said ""You look different"" I said ""Well I guess""
She said ""You been gone"" I said ""That's only natural""
She said ""You gonna stay ?"" I said ""If you want me to, Yeah "".
Isis oh Isis you mystical child
What drives me to you is what drives me insane
I still can remember the way that you smiled
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.

I consider it a challenge before the whole human race and I ain't gonna lose.
And we mean to go on, and on, and on, and on.
 We are the champions, my friends.
And we'll keep on fighting 'till the end.
 We are the champions, we are the cham-pions.
 No time for losers, 'cos we are the champions, of the...

49,Rocky Mountain Way,Joe Walsh,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/joe-walsh/rocky-mountain-way-chords-284,"Spent the last year Rocky Mountain Way
Couldn't get much higher
Out to pasture think it's safe to say
Time to open fire
And we don't need the ladies cryin' cause the story's sad   Ah ha
Cause the Rocky Mountain Way is better than the way we had
Well he's tellin us this and he's tellin us that changes it every day
Says it doesn't matter
Bases are loaded and Casey's at bat playin it play by play
Time to change the batter
And we don't need the ladies cryin cause the story's sad   Ah ha
Cause the Rocky Mountain Way is better than the way we had

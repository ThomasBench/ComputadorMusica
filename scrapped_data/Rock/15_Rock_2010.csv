Your long hair flowed down in blues and whites. I just stood there, bathed in the quiet.
No, you say youll cut your bangs, Im calling your bluff. When you lie to me its in the small stuff.
No, you say youll cut your bangs, Im calling your bluff. When you lie to me its in the small stuff.
Now your mouth is foaming like a rabid dog, and where the river flowed is now a clouded fog.
Your teeth are gnashing louder than your monologue, and I just stood there, bathed in the quiet.
No, you say youll cut your bangs, Im calling your bluff. When you lie to me its in the small stuff.
No, you say youll cut your bangs, Im calling your bluff. When you lie to me its in the small stuff.
Now the flesh is melting off of your bones. The maggots around your heart make themselves at home.
Where the river flowed I am left alone. I just stood there, bathed in the quiet.
No, you say youll cut your bangs, Im calling your bluff. When you lie to me its in the small stuff.
No, you say youll cut your bangs, Im calling your bluff. When you lie to me its in the small stuff.

But we don’t talk in the same way that we used to

She puts me in my place, but I don’t know where I stand,
And if only I could find the words, or muster up the nerve to tell her
I’ll never forget her and she’ll always have a part of me.
Don’t let me go down this road again
We both know where this ends
In a storm of feeling, I’m so unappealing

I was falling for a girl who would ask me to come over
Just for a day, when her parents were away,
Now all I can do is lay in my room,
Fall asleep, dream of you, then wake up and do nothing about it
I fell for a boy who could never ever let me walk home that way,
So hold back your views, we’re both leaving soon,
I can’t fall back on you, 'cause that’s not what I do.

Shadows will scream that I'm alone-one-one
I - I - I - I - I've got a migraine
And my pain will range from up, down and sideways
Thank God it's Friday 'cause Fridays will always
Be better than Sundays 'cause Sundays are my suicide days
I don't know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow and a slight drizzle
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head

It's me defending in suspense, it's me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examinant
That's represented best by my
Depress...ing thoughts
I do not have writer's block, my writer just hates the clock
It will not let me sleep, I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead

Something you won't forget, it's all about my forehead
And how it is a door that holds back contents
That make Pandora's Box's contents look nonviolent
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
My mind's shipwrecked, this is the only land my mind could
Find, I did not know this was such a violent island
Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions
They're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find

And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing
But the salt in my wounds
Isn't burning anymore than it used to
It's not that I don't feel the pain
It's just I'm not afraid of hurting anymore
And the blood in these veins
Isn't pumping any less than it ever has
And that's the hope I have
The only thing I know is keeping me alive

    I have some scars from where I’ve been.
    You’ve got eyes that can see right through me,
    You’re not afraid of anything they’ve seen.
I was told that I would feel nothing the first time
I don't know how these cuts heal, but in you I found a rhyme.
If there is a light,   you can't always see,
And there is a world   we can't always be.
If there is a dark   that we shouldn't doubt,
And there is a light,   don't let it go out.
And this is a Song                    a Song for Someone;
This is a Song                    a Song for Someone
    You let me into a conversation,
    A conversation only we could make.
    You break and enter my imagination;
    Whatever's in there, it's yours to take.
I was told that I would feel nothing the first time
You were slow to heal, but this could be the night.
If there is a light,   you can't always see,
And there is a world   we can't always be.
If there is a dark   within and without
And there is a light,   don't let it go out.
And this is a Song                    a Song for Someone;
This is a Song                    a Song for Someone
And I'm a long, long way from your hill of Calvary,
And I'm a long way from where I was and where I need to be.
If there is a light,   you can't always see,
And there is a world   we can't always be.
If there is a kiss    I stole from your mouth
And this is a light,   don't let it go out.

Dropped a dozen cheap roses in my shopping cart
Made it out to the truck without breaking down
Everybody knows you in a speed trap town
It's a Thursday night but there's a high school game
Sneak a bottle up the bleachers and forget my name
These 5-A bastards run a shallow cross
It's a boy's last dream and a man's first loss
And it never did occur to me to leave, 'til tonight
There's no one left to ask if I'm all right
Sleep until I'm straight enough to drive, then decide
If there's anything that can't be left behind
The doctor said daddy wouldn't make it a year
But the holidays are over and he's still here
How long can they keep you in the ICU
Veins through the skin like a faded tattoo
Was a tough state trooper 'til a decade back
When that girl who wasn't mama caused his heart attack
He didn't care about us when he was walkin' around
Just pulling women over in a speed trap town
But it never did occur to me to leave, 'til tonight
When I realized he'll never be all right
Sign my name and say my last goodbye, then decide
That there's nothing here that can't be left behind
Roads got blurry when the sun came up
Slept a couple hours in the pickup truck
Drank a cup of coffee by an Indian mound
Thousand miles away from that speed trap town
Thousand miles away from that speed trap town

I did not transcend, I felt like a walking piece of
Shit, in a stupid looking jacket
I walked around town and felt like I was in Sodom
There were filthy people seeking comfort for their bodies
It was so obscene
Filled with loathing and religious fervor
I laid on my friend’s bedroom floor for an hour
And tried not to piss my pants               And then I saw Jesus, and he said
“Whoooooooooo-are-yooouuuu to go against the word of my father? And
Whoooooooooo-are-yooouuuu? the scum of the earth”
No we are just, we are just, we are just teens of style
Oh we are just, we are just, we are just teens of style
There were people getting drunk, there were people getting high
They were falling to pieces right before my eyes
And I said “mmhmm” a lot (mmhmm)
And there was one guy there who kept asking me how does it feel
And I didn’t even know how to begin to answer that question
So I just said I don't want to talk about it
So there I was, just another shitbag civilian
Afraid of the cops when I was outside, afraid of my friends when I was inside
And I grew tired of the scene              And then my dad showed up, And he was like
“Whoooooooooo-are-yooouuuu to go against the word of our fathers?""

There were needles on the ground

No more secrets, no more clues

You can almost see the moon
   The streets are windy

Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me so why did you go 
  Away?
  Away.
I do recall now the smell of the rain,
fresh on the pavement. I ran off the plane.
That July 9th. The beat of your heart,
it jumps through your shirt. I can still feel your arms.
But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name forever the name on my lips
I do remember the swing in your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then you pull me in
I'm not much for dancin', but for you I did
Because I love your handshake, meetin' my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of sayin' something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions
And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name forever the name on my lips
Oo-oo-ooh.
  So I'll watch your life in pictures
Like I used to watch you sleep
And I'll feel you forget me
Like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends
Just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
but I never planned on you changing your mind
So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this

you said 'better now' with a smile
but to be honest it made my day
i didn't wanna fall but then i stepped right in
i looked up at your face
and those eyes, they drew me in, it was too late for me
that's what we were
it wasn't made to work
but i wouldn't have it any other way   (any other way)
you were so witty and so charming, swept me off my feet
you made me laugh, you made me blush
oh no one could compete  (no one could compete)
it seemed too good to be true
i wanted to be with you
or the clacking of tap shoes
you say 'hey'
i gotta know, do you feel this way?'
you said 'yeah i do, but i was scared of what you might say…'
that’s all we were,
a silly cliché
i still think you’re cute
but maybe it’s better this way
bah duh dum
bah duh dum
bah duh duh duh duh dum
that’s okay
we’re just a little cliché
a little cliche
but that’s okay!

You had me fucked up
It used to be so hard to see
Yeah, loving is easy
When everything's perfect
Please don't change a single little thing for me
      When you can't even hide it
And it didn't take forever to find it
I was all on my own
Almost glad to be alone
Until love came in on time, on time

I hold one card
That I can't use

We're starting over

You're in the house
And I am here in the car

Where I can scream
How I love you
I found you
I found the door
But when I stepped through
There was no floor

Let me touch your cheek
I will always love you
Having your face hit
Having your lip split
By the one who loves you
Real love, real love
Real love makes your lungs black
Real love is a heart attack
Showing your mother
To any other, letting them touch her
Looking up to her, watching her do her makeup and hair
Real love, real love
Real love makes your lungs black
Real love is a heart attack
Cry like a bird, fly like a baby
Mamma got drunk and daddy went crazy
If your speech slurs, if you feel shaky, meet me out back
I'll be there waiting
Riding in the back seat
Watching the spit fly and the hummingbird cry
O mamma, o papa
O mamma, o papa
How much blood is worth the draw?
How much blood is worth the draw?
Real love, real love
Real love makes your lungs black
Hummingbird watching
Watching her young thing
Grow up so fast
Looking up to her, watching her do her makeup and hair

But the lands and the grooves
Unequivocally proved the truth
How did I get so confused?
My path, totally askew
Tapped the karma bank til I overdrew
Could have been so much more shrewd
With my moves and eschewed
The fast buck, the too good to be true
Thought I was just payin' dues
Next thing I know, interviewed
Now stuck in a life sentence queue
Raged up, caged up, in an screw loose zoo
And all l I view is bad news crews
Face tattooed and gunnin' for you
Got lost, clowder, group of cats
Lost cause, louder, dogs in a pack
Yes boss, now sir, mischief of rats
Numbers matter, we’re all stats
Cats, dogs
Just pining, second chance at the life I blew
Just whining, about the permanent concrete view
Just lining, up for the institutions stew
My kid grew up, “no pops” tattoo
Weight, can’t pay back I O U
Daily praying, life was peek-a-boos
Story time with Winnie the pooh
Right through to a big debut, for you
But I don’t know a thing about you
Nothing about you
Could be livin’ like your old man
Testin the avenue
But I don’t have a fucking clue
No I don’t have a fucking clue
Got lost, clowder, group of cats
Lost cause, louder, dogs in a pack
Yes boss, now sir, mischief of rats
Numbers matter, we’re all stats

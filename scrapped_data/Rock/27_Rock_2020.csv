When I miss her most of all
I miss her laughter
So long after
That laughter's gone
There's no comfort in these tears that I cry
Wish I could find just one person to tell me why
I just wanna wake up
Underneath that open sky
Just wanna feel somethin' real
Before I die
And lately it's the evenings
When I really feel the years
All my sorrows
All my joys
All my fears
I hear children singin' songs, playin' games
They don't know that growin' up is learnin' pain
I just wanna wake up
Underneath that open sky
Just wanna feel somethin' real
Before I die
I don't know where I'm going
I've got miles and miles yet to run
Wontcha follow me on the highway to the sun
Wontcha follow me on the highway to the sun

Why we made it this way

The way your mind and mine relate
It breaks the patterns we make
Still, we're slowly comin' together

You spent ten days in bed when I asked you why
And requested my whereabouts through tweets
Darling, why do you bury yourself in sheets? Well, I told you
 There's unrest in the House of Lords
 Written on sandwich boards
Outside the shop where they sell your favourite drink
So what do you think you're doing telling people lies?
 The hope's going like Christmas pies
But it's never gonna stop you turning pink
Daniel, you know it, you wanted to
Find a place on your own like you always do
I'd bear in mind
Daniel, you're still a child
Daniel's gone running, the trail's gone cold
You've been acting quite strangely since ten years old
And when you were eleven
They said, ""You ought to pray to high heaven you don't get caught""
Well, Daniel, don't worry, you won't be missed
You'll spend ten years in prison to pay for this
Ah, is it all worthwhile?
Daniel, you're still a child
 You got a death wish, child
Four cans of pesticide to drink
 4:30 Western Time
 The boy's been arrested, why do you think?

Girl, I think about you every day now
    Was a time when I wasn't sure
  You set my mind at ease
  There ain’t doubt you're in my heart now
  Said “woman take it slow, and it'll work itself out fine”
All we need is just a little patience
 Said ""sugar make it slow and we'll come together fine""
All we need is just a little patience
    I sit here on the stairs
I'd rather be alone
If I can't have you right now, I'll wait dear
    Sometimes I get so tense
Can't speed up the time
But you know love there's one more thing to consider
  Said ""woman take it slow and things will be just fine""
If you and I'll just use a little patience
 Said ""sugar take the time 'cause the lights are shining bright""
You and I got what it takes to make it
 I've been walking the streets at night
 Just trying to get it right
 It's hard to see with so many around
You know I don't like being stuck in the crowd
And the streets don't change but maybe the names
You know I ain't got time for the game 'cause I need you...yeah I need you

And told her I so long had been prepared for her

They say that love it comes and goes
But darling what, what do they know
I'm reaching for heaven, we'll make it there
Darling it's just the power of prayer
Baby it's just the power of prayer
Darling it's just the power of prayer
Last call, the bouncer shuts the door
This magic moment drifts across the floor
As Ben E. King's voice fills the air
Baby that's the power of prayer
The blood moon shines across the veil
Bells ring out through churches and jails
I tally my wounds and count the scars
Here in the house of a thousand guitars
The criminal clown has stolen the throne
He steals what he can never own
May the truth ring out from every small town bar
We'll light up the house of a thousand guitars
Well it's alright yeah it's alright
Meet me darlin' come Saturday night
All good souls from near and far
Will meet in the house of a thousand guitars
Here the bitter and the bored
Wake in search of the lost chord
That'll band us together for as long as there's stars
Yeah in the house of a thousand guitars
Well it's alright yeah it's alright
Meet me darlin' come Saturday night
Brother and sister wherever you are
We'll meet in the house of a thousand guitars
So wake and shake off your troubles my friend
We'll go where the music never ends
From the stadiums to the small town bars
We'll light up the house of a thousand guitars
House of a thousand guitars, house of a thousand guitars
Brother and sister wherever you are
We'll rise together till we find the spark
That'll light up the house of a thousand guitars
Well it's alright yeah it's alright
Meet me darlin' come Saturday night
All the souls from near and far
We'll meet at the house of a thousand guitars
A thousand guitars, a thousand guitars
A thousand guitars, a thousand guitars
A thousand guitars, a thousand guitars
A thousand guitars, a thousand guitars
Parched crops dying 'neath a dead sun
We've been praying but no good comes
The dog's howling, home's stripped bare
We've been worried but now we're scared
People come for comfort or just to come
Taste the dark sticky potion or hear the drums
Hands raised to Yahweh to bring the rain down
He comes crawlin' 'cross the dry fields like a dark shroud
Rainmaker, a little faith for hire
Rainmaker, the house is on fire
Rainmaker, take evеrything you have
Sometimes folks need to bеlieve in something so bad, so bad, so bad
They'll hire a rainmaker (rainmaker)
Rainmaker says white's black and black's white
Says night's day and day's night
Says close your eyes and go to sleep now
I'm in a burnin' field unloadin' buckshot into low clouds
Rainmaker, a little faith for hire
Rainmaker, the house is on fire
Rainmaker, take evеrything you have
Sometimes folks need to bеlieve in something so bad, so bad, so bad
They'll hire a rainmaker (rainmaker)
Slow moving wagon drawing through a dry town
Painted rainbow, crescent moon and dark clouds
Brother patriot come forth and lay it down
Your blood brother for king and crown for your rainmaker
They come for the smile, the firm handshake
They come for the raw chance of a fair shake
Some come to make damn sure, my friend
This mean season's got nothin' to do with them
They come 'cause they can't stand the pain
Of another long hot day of no rain
'Cause they don't care or understand
What it really takes for the sky to open up the land
Rainmaker, a little faith for hire
Rainmaker, the house is on fire
Rainmaker, take evеrything you have
Sometimes folks need to bеlieve in something so bad, so bad, so bad
They'll hire a rainmaker
Rainmaker
Rainmaker
Rainmaker
There's a light on yonder mountain and it's callin' me to shine
There's a girl over by the water fountain and she's asking to be mine
That Jesus is standing in the doorway in a buckskin jacket, boots and spurs so fine
Says, ""We need you, son, tonight up in Dodge City
'Cause there's just too many outlaws tryin' to work the same line""
Now if Jesus was a sheriff and I was the priest
If my lady was an heiress and my Mama was a thief
If Papa rode shotgun on the Fargo line
There's still too many bad boys tryin' to work the same line
Well sweet Virgin Mary runs the Holy Grail saloon
Where for a nickel she'll give you whiskey and a personally blessed balloon
And the holy ghost is the host with the most he runs the burlesque show
Where they'll let in for free and they hit you when you go
Mary serves mass on Sunday and she sells her body on Monday
To the bootlegger who will pay the highest price
He don't know he got stuck with a loser, she's a stone junkie, what's more she's a user
She's only been made once or twice by some kind of magic
If Jesus was a sheriff and I was the priest
If my lady was an heiress and my Mama was a thief
If Papa rode shotgun on the Fargo line
There's still too many outlaws trying to work the same line
Well things ain't been the same in heaven since big bad Bobby came to town
He's been known to down eleven then ask for another round
Me, I got scabs on my knees from kneeling way too long
It's about time I played the man and took a stand where I belong
Yeah, forget about the old friends and the old times
There's just too many new boys tryin' to work the same line
Well if Jesus was a sheriff and I was the priest
If my lady was an heiress and my Mama was a thief
If Papa rode shotgun on the Fargo line
There's just too many outlaws trying to work the same line
Well, there's a light on yonder mountain and it's callin' me to shine
There's a girl over by the water fountain and she's asking to be mine
Jesus is standing in the doorway, six guns drawn and ready to fan
Said, ""We need you tonight, son, up in Dodge City""
Told him I was already overdue for Cheyenne
Yeah, if Jesus was a sheriff and I was the priest
If my lady was an heiress and my Mama was a thief
If Papa rode shotgun on the Fargo line
There's still too many bad boys tryin' to work the same line
If Jesus was a sheriff and I was the priest
If my lady was an heiress and my Mama was a thief
If Papa rode shotgun on the Fargo line
There's still too many bad boys tryin' to work the same line
If Jesus was a sheriff and I was the priest
I hear the sound of your guitar
Comin' in from the mystic far
Stone and the gravel in your voice
Come in my dreams and I rejoice
It's your ghost moving through the night
Spirit filled with light
I need, need you by my side
Your love and I'm
Alive, I can feel the blood shiver in my bones
I'm alive and I'm out here on my own
I'm alive and I'm coming home
Old buckskin jacket you always wore
Hangs on the back of my bedroom door
Boots and the spurs you used to ride
Click down the hall but never arrive
It's just your ghost moving through the night
Spirit filled with light
I need, need you by my side
Your love and I'm
Alive, I can feel the blood shiver in my bones
I'm alive and I'm out here on my own
I'm alive and I'm coming home
Old Fender Twin from Johnny's Music downtown
Still set on 10 to burn this house down
Count the band in then kick into overdrive
By the end of the set we leave no one alive
Ghosts runnin' through the night
Our spirits filled with light
I need, need you by my side
Your love and I'm alive
I shoulder your Les Paul and finger the fretboard
I make my vows to those who've come before
I turn up the volume, let the spirits be my guide
Meet you brother and sister on the other side
Alive, I can feel the blood shiver in my bones
I'm alive and I'm out here on my own
I'm alive and I'm coming home
Yeah I'm coming home
Na na na na     na na na     na na
Na na na na     na na na     na na

Well the multitude assembled and tried to make the noise
Them black blind poet generals and restless loud white boys
But time's grew thin and the axis grew somehow incomplete
Where instead of child lions we had aging junkie sheep
Well how many wasted have I seen signed ""Hollywood or bust""
And left to ride the ever ghostly Arizona gusts
Cheerleader tramps and kids with big amps sounding in the void
High society vamps, ex-heavyweight champs mistaking soot for soil
So break me now big Mama as Old Faithful breaks the day
Believe me my good Linda, the aurora will shine the way
The confederacy's in my name now, the hounds are held at bay
The axis needs a stronger arm, do you feel your muscles play
Well the doorstep blanket weaver, Madonna pushes bells
From house to house I see her giving last kisses and wishing well
To every gypsy mystic hero that the kids might find a place
Who get lost forever mothers and fathers on their weekends out in space
Well sons they search for fathers, but the fathers are all gone
The lost souls search for saviors, but saviors don't last long
Those aimless questless renegade brats who live their lives in song
They run the length of a candle, in a goodnight whisper and they're gone
So break me now big Mama as Old Faithful breaks the day
Believe me my good Linda, the aurora will shine the way
The confederacy's in my name now, the hounds are held at bay
The axis needs a stronger arm, do you feel your muscles play
Well the missions are filled with hermits, they're looking for a friend
The terraces are filled with cat-men just looking for a way in
Those orphans jumped on silver mountains lost in celestial alleyways
They wait for that old tramp Dog Man Moses, he takes in all the strays
Now don't you grow on empty legends or lonely cradle songs
Billy the Kid was just a bowery boy who made a living twirling his guns
The night she's long and lanky and she speaks in a mother tongue
She lullabies the refugees with amplifier's hum
So break me now big Mama as Old Faithful breaks the day
Believe me my good Linda, the aurora will shine the way
The confederacy's in my name now, the hounds are held at bay
The axis needs a stronger arm, do you feel your muscles play
The confederacy's in my name now, the hounds are held at bay
The axis needs a stronger arm, do you feel your muscles play
The road is long and seeming without end
The days go on, I remember you my friend
And though you're gone and my heart's been empty it seems
I'll see you in my dreams
I got your guitar here by the bed
All your favorite records and all the books that you read
And though my soul feels like it's been split at the seams
I'll see you in my dreams
I'll see you in my dreams when all our summers have come to an end
I'll see you in my dreams, we'll meet and live and laugh again
I'll see you in my dreams, yeah around the river bend
For death is not the end
And I'll see you in my drеams
I'll see you in my dreams when all our summers have come to an end
I'll see you in my dreams, we'll meet and live and laugh again
I'll see you in my dreams, yeah around the river bend
For death is not the end
And I'll see you in my dreams
See you in my dreams
See you in my dreams
And I'll see you in my dreams

There is not a single face
What we are feels so easy
I’m falling into you
It ain’t nothing new
The mirror of our youth
Do you sleep or do you pray?
I got lost in yesterday
Oh I wanna fall into your arms
Where I could hide ’til kingdom come
Oh oh oh oh oh
In five years, keep it real
Will be lying here
Is small as the mosquito
Tasting the sweat on our skin
Sounds of violins
Announcing the spring
We’re up all night
There is not a single face

The mirror of our youth
Do you sleep or do you pray?
I got lost in yesterday
Oh I wanna fall into your arms
Where I could hide ’til kingdom come
Oh oh oh oh oh
Those walls I’ve built went down
They finally turned to dust
I’ll remember and mark my words
That I painted in the dust
Oh I wanna fall
Do you sleep or do you pray
I got lost in yesterday
Oh I wanna fall into your arms
Where I could hide ’til kingdom come
You want me to feel okay
I feel bad because I ain’t
Oh I wanna fall into your arms
Where I could hide ’til kingdom come

From the day you arrive, till you walk, till you run
There is nothing but pride, there is nothing but love
They can offer advice that you don't wanna hear
Words that cut like a knife and still ring in your ear
You think of them ignorant, they think of you arrogant
If you need evidence, who gave you confidence?
A snap of the finger and you're not a child
But you're still holding on as you walk down the aisle
When they give you away to hear someone else say
That someone will love you till their dying day
Fathers love daughters like mothers love sons
They've been writing our story before there was one
From the day you arrive till you walk, till you run
There is nothing but pride, there is nothing but love
And that's the story of love
You can choose to remember or choose to forget
If they took you to school or they tucked you in bed
You can say it don't matter, you won't do the same
You'd think no one noticed when you looked away
Fathers love daughters like mothers love sons
They've been writing our story before there was one
From the day you arrive till you walk, till you run
There is nothing but pride, there is nothing but love
Now they're getting older and you ain't so young
So you take care of them like your daughters and sons
You can ask for forgiveness, they could ask for the same
Forget all the anguish, the heartache, the pain
Wherever you go or wherever you've been
It's them that is with you and that's you that's with them
Fathers and daughters and mothers and sons
As one story ends another's, another's begun
Oh, fathers love daughters like mothers love sons
They've been writing our story before there was one
From the day you arrive till you walk, till you run
There is nothing but pride, there is nothing but love

46,Let It Rain,Bon Jovi,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bon-jovi/let-it-rain-chords-3359456,"Ever since there was thunder
There's been shelter from the storm
A place to run for cover
Till the rain clouds had moved on
Now when I get that feeling
Before the first drop hits the ground
I'm asking, ""Who's gonna stop the rain from falling down?""
Wherever there's a soldier
Who won't give up the fight
Wherever there's a darkness
That's trying to find the light
Wherever there is hurting
There is healing on the way
Like sunshine breaking through a cloudy day
Let it rain, let it rain
Let the rain fall all around
Who's gonna stop the rain from falling down?
Maybe someday eyes won't judge you
By the bed you're sleeping in
The God you want to pray to
Or the color of your skin
When priests and politicians
Sell the truth and nothing more
That day we'll know what all of this was for
Let it rain, let it rain
Let the rain fall all around
Who's gonna stop the rain from falling down?
These ain't pretty pictures that we're keeping in the cloud
Outside a storm is raging
Just take a look around
Somewhere there's forgiveness
For the broken ones like me
Who once stared down mighty mountains
And now sit beneath the trees
And somewhere there's a church bell
That's summoning the choir
Somewhere there's a dreamer
Who would walk 1, 000 miles
Somewhere there's a dreamer
Who would walk a 1, 000 miles
Let it rain, let it rain
Let the rain fall all around
Who's gonna stop the rain from falling?
If you're out there, Christ I'm calling
Who's gonna stop the rain from falling down?

47,Always,The Snuts,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-snuts/always-chords-3359714,"My sweetest syncopation
Now put your mind at ease
I got you where I want you
No way that I could leave
And I always want you
Came to the dark conclusion
That now just ain't my time
I'll save you all that sunlight
Until the world is mine
And I always want you
And I'm breakin' it down
Singin' it louder, babe
I'm still fallin' for you
I'm still callin' on you
Tellin' me how 'cause I can't explain today
How I been feelin' maybe
Something you could say to me
Make it all as right as rain my brown eyed girl
You know I love you every morning
My brown eyed girl, you know I love you more
Every morning
My sweetest syncopation
You soothe my mind with ease
I need you now and always
Keep your roots beneath my tree
And I'll always want you
Divide and conquer my way
Restrained and loyal I'll stay
I love you more with every worried breath your lungs take
It's you
I'll always want you
I'm breakin' it down
Singin' it louder, babe
I'm still fallin' for you
I'm still callin' on you
Tellin' me how 'cause I can't explain today
How I been feelin' maybe
Something you could say to me
Make it all as right as rain my brown eyed girl
You know I love you every morning
My brown eyed girl, you know I love you more
Every morning
Yeah, make it all as right as rain, I say
Yeah, make it all as right, I say
Now make it all as right as rain my bright eyed girl
You know I love you every morning

All   fall down
My love is black and blue
My love is next to you
My love is true
My love is made of wood
My love is understood
My love is good, good
And you can hide all you want
But it doesn't change a single little thing
And you can smile
Till your heart falls out
Still we will sing
All fall down (down, down, down, down)
All   fall down
Your love is made of gold
Your love is rock 'n' roll
Your love is cold
But your love will never lie
Whatever we survive
All in our light
And you can hide all you want
But it doesn't change a single little thing
And you can cry
Till your eyes fall out
Still we will sing
All fall down (down, down, down, down)
All   fall down

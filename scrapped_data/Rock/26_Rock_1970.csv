Love is in the air, every sight and every sound.
And I don't know if I'm being foolish,
Don't know if I'm feeling wise.
But it's something that I must believe in,
And it's there when I look in your eyes.
Love is in the air, in the whisper of a tree,
Love is in the air, in the thunder of the sea.
And I don't know if I am just dreaming,
Don't know if I'm feeling safe.
But it's something that  I must believe in,
And it's there when you call out my name.
Love is in the air,        
Oh, love is in the air, in the rising of the sun,
Love is in the air, when the day is nearly done.
But I don't know if you're an illusion,
Don't know if I see the truth,
But there's something that I must believe in,
and you're there when I reach out for you.
Love is in the air, everywhere I look around,
Love is in the air, every sight and every sound.
And I don't know if I'm being foolish,
Don't know if I'm feeling wise.
But it's something that I must believe in,
And it's there when I look in your eyes.
Love is in the air,

Things are okay with me these days
Got a good job, got a good office
Got a new wife, got a new life
And the family's fine
We lost touch long ago 
You lost weight
I did not know
   You could ever look so good after
So much ti-i-i-me.
You re member those days hanging out
At the village green
Engineer boots, leather jackets
And tight blue jeans
Drop a dime in the box play the
Song about New Or leans
   Cold beer,    hot lights
   My sweet ro mantic teenage

   Brenda and Eddie were the popular steadies
And the king and the queen of the prom
Riding around with the car top down and the radio on
   Nobody looked any finer
Or was more of a hit at the Parkway Diner
We never knew we could want more than that out of life
Surely Brenda and Eddie would always know how to sur vive.
Oooh oh   oh oh     oh oh   oh oh oh oh
Oooh oh   oh oh     oh oh   oh oh oh oh
Brenda and Eddie were still going steady in the summer of '75
When they decided the marriage would be at the end of July
Everyone said they were crazy
""Brenda you know you're much too lazy
Eddie could never af ford to live that kind of life.""          
ohhh But there we were wavin' Brenda and Eddie good bye.
Oh oh    oh oh   oh oh
They got an apartment with deep pile carpet
And a couple of paintings from Sears
A big waterbed that they bought with the bread
They had saved for a couple of years
They started to fight when the money got tight
And they just didn't count on the tears.
Whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh   yaaa rock n’
 roll
                                        oh
 Oh    oh oh
They lived for a while in a very nice style
But it's always the same in the  end
They got a divorce as a matter of course
And they parted the closest of freh- ends
Then the king and the queen went back to the green
But you can never go back there a gain.
Oh oh oh ohhhhh    oh oh oh ohhhhhh
Brenda and Eddie had had it already
By the summer of '75
From the high to the low
To the end of the show
For the rest of their lives
They couldn't go back to the greasers
The best they could do was pick up the pieces
We always knew they would both find a way to get by   ooooh
That's all I heard about Brenda and Eddie
Can't tell you more than I told you al ready
And here we are wavin' Brenda and Eddie good
Bye. Oh oh  Oh oh  Oh oh oh oh

Cause the sweetest kiss I ever got is the one I've never tasted
Oh but they'll take their bonus pay  to Molly McDonald,
 Neon ladies, beauty is that which obeys,  is bought or borrowed
Cause my heart's become a crooked hotel  full of rumours 
But it's I who pays the rent for these fingered-face out-of-tuners
And I make 16 solid half hour friendships every evening
Cause your queen of hearts who is half a stone
And likes to laugh alone is always threatening you with leaving
Oh but they play those token games    on Willy Thompson
 And give a medal to replace the son    of Mrs. Annie Johnson
Cause they told me everybody's got to pay their dues
And I explained that I had overpaid them
So overdued I went to the company store
and the clerk there said that they had just been invaded
So I set sail in a teardrop and escaped beneath the doorsill
Cause the smell of her perfume echoes in my head still
Cause I see my people trying to drown the sun
In weekends of whiskey sours
Cause how many times can you wake up in this comic book and plant flowers?

That night I ain't forgotten
Where she dealt out the rations
With some or other passions
I said you are a lady
Perhaps she said I may be
We moved into a basement
With talks of our engagement
We stayed in by the telly
Although the room was smelly
We spent our time just kissin'
The Railway Arms we're missin'
But love had got us hooked up
And all the time it took off
I got a job with Stanley
He said I'd come in handy
And he started me on Monday
So I had a bath on Sunday
I worked eleven hours
And bought the girl some flowers
She said she'd seen a doctor
And nothing now could stop her
I worked all through the winter
The weather brass and bitter
I put away a tenner
Each week to make her better
And when the time was ready
We had to sell the telly
Late evenings by the fire
And little kicks inside her
This morning at four fifty
I took her rather nifty
Down to an incubator
Where thirty minutes later
She gave birth to a daughter
Within a year a walker
She looked just like her mother
If there could be another
And now she's two years older
Her mother's with a soldier
She left me with my drinkin'
Became a proper stingin'
The devil came and took me
From bar to street to bookie
No more nights by the telly
No more nights nappies smelling
Alone here in the kitchen
I feel there's somethin' missin'
I beg for some forgiveness
But beggin's not my business
And she won't write a letter
Although I always tell her

On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here""
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
She calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit
here since 1969""
And still those voices are calling from
far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They’re living it up at the Hotel
California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis""
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said: ""We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device""
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
""Relax,"" said the night man
""We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave...

I love you more than money and more than the stars above
I love you more than madness, more than dreams upon the sea
I love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me
Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete
I said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street
In the courtyards of the jester, which is hidden from the sun
I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun
You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live
When I was deep in poverty, you taught me how to give
Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole
I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul
You gave me babies one, two, three, what is more, you saved my life
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife
My thoughts of you don't ever rest, they'd kill me if I lie
But I'd sacrifice the world for you to watch my senses die
The tune that is yours and mine, to play upon this earth
We'll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth
What's lost is lost, we can't regain what went down in the flood
But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood
It's never been my duty to remake the world at large
Nor is it my intention to sound a battle charge
'Cause I love you more than all of that, with a love that doesn't bend
And if there is eternity, I'd love you there again
Oh, can't you see that you were born to stand by my side
And I was born to be with you, you were born to be my bride
You're the other half of what I am, you're the missing piece
And I love you more than ever with that love that doesn't cease
You turn the tide on me each day and teach my eyes to see
Just being next to you is a natural thing for me
And I could never let you go, no matter what goes on

47,Rosie,Jackson Browne,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jackson-browne/rosie-chords-62667,"well, she was standing at the load in, when the trucks rolled up
She was sniffing all around like a half-grown female pup
She wasn't hard to talk to, looked like she had no where to go
So I gave her a pass so she could get in and see the show
Well, I sat her down right next to me and I got her a beer
While I mixed that sound on the stage so the band could hear
The more I watched her watch them play, the less I thought of to say
and when they walked offstage, the drummer swept that girl away
but Rosie your alright (you wear my ring)
when you hold me tight (Rosie, that's my thing)
when you turn out the lights (I got to hand it to me)
Looks like it's me and you again tonight, Rosie
Well I guess I might've known from the start, she'd come for a star
Could've told my imagination not to run too far
with all the times that I've been burned, by now you'd think I'd  learned
that it's who you look like, not who you are
but Rosie your alright (you wear my ring)
when you hold me tight (Rosie, that's my thing)
when you turn out the lights (I got to hand it to me)
Looks like it's me and you again tonight, Rosie
Rosie          Repeat and fade out

VERSE 3:     One night in a club called the Shakin' Hand,          
         There was a fourty-two decibel rockin' band. 
         And the music was good and the music was loud.
         And the singer turned and he said to the crowd:
         ""Let there be rock.""

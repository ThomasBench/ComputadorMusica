Signed with a home tattoo happy birthday to you was created for ya
Can't ever keep from falling apart  at the seams
Can't I believe you're taking my heart    too pieces
Oh, it'll take a little time might take a little crime to come undone now
We'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside
Hey child  stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry
Who do you need who do you love    when you come undone
Who do you need who do you love   when you come undone
Words play me deja-vu like a radio tune I swear I've heard before
Chills is it something real or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers
Can't ever keep from falling apart  at the seams
Can't I believe you're taking my heart    too pieces
Lost in a snow filled sky we'll make it alright to come undone now
We'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside
Hey child stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry
Who do you need who do you love   when you come undone
Who do you need who do you love   when you come undone
Who do you need who do you love  when you come undone

Think of her in bed
Laying there just watching telly then think of me instead
I'll never grow so old and flabby, that could never be
Don't marry her, have me
Your love light shines like cardboard
But your work shoes are glistening
She's a PHD in 'I told you so'
You've a knighthood in 'I'm not listening'
She'll grab your Sandra Bullocks and slowly raise the knee
Don't marry her, have me
And the Sunday sun shines down on San Francisco Bay
And you realise you can't make it anyway
You have to wash the car, take the kiddies to the park,
Don't marry her, have me
Those lovely Sunday mornings
With breakfast brought in bed
Those blackbirds look like knitting needles trying to peck your head
Those birds will peck your soul out and throw away the key
Don't marry her, have me
And the kitchen's always tidy
The bathroom's always clean
She's a diploma in 'just hiding things', you've a first in 'low esteem'
When your socks smell of angels, but your life smells of Brie
Don't marry her, have me
And the Sunday sun shines down on San Francisco Bay
And you realise you can't make it anyway
You have to wash the car, take the kiddies to the park,

I was puzzled by a dream, stayed with me all day in 1995
My brother had confessed he was gay
It took the heat off me for a while
He stood up with a sailor friend
Made it known upon my sister's wedding day
I got married in a rush to save a kid from being deported
Now she's in love
I was so touched, I was moved to kick the crutches
From my crippled friend
She was not impressed that I cured her on the Sabbath
So I went to confess
When she saw the funny side, we introduced my child bride
To whisky and gin, to whisky and gin
The priest in the booth had a photographic memory
For all he had heard
He took all of my sins and he wrote a pocket novel called
""The State I Am In""
So I gave myself to God, there was a pregnant pause
before he said ok
Now I spend my day turning tables round in Marks & Spencer's
They don't seem to mind
I gave myself to sin
I gave myself to Providence
And I've been there and back again
The state that I am in
I gave myself to sin
I gave myself to Providence
And I've been there and back again
The state that I am in
Oh, love of mine, would you condescend to help me
I am stupid and blind
Desperation is the Devil's work, it is the folly
of a boys empty mind
Now I'm feeling dangerous, riding on city buses for a
hobby is sad
Lead me to a living end, I promised that I'd entertain
my crippled friend
My crippled friend
I gave myself to sin
I gave myself to Providence
And I've been there and back again

11,High Hopes (ver 2),Pink Floyd,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/pink-floyd/high-hopes-chords-1407550,"   Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
   In a world of magnets and miracles
   Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
   The ringing of the division bell had begun
   Along the long road and on down the causeway
   Do they still meet there by the cut
   There was a ragged band who followed in our footsteps
   Running before times took our dreams away
   Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
   To a life consumed by slow decay
   The grass was greener
The light was brighter
When friends surrounded
The nights of wonder
   Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
   To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
   Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
   Dragged by the force of some inner tide
   At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
   We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world
   Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
  There's a hunger still unsatisfied
   Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
   Go down this road I've been so many times
   The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing

I should have seen just what was there and not some holy light

Only takes one match,

At the scout's hall
At the football
Where the wise we trust are paid

Burning down the bridges of my memory
Love may still be alive somewhere someway
where they're downing only deer a hundred steel towns away

with the words ""I love you"" rolling off my tongue
No never will I roam for I know my place is home
where the ocean meets the sky I'll be sailing
Photographs and kerosene
light up my darkness, light it up, light it up
I can still feel the touch of your thin blue jeans
Running down the alley I've got my eyes all over you babe
Oh babe
Oh the rhythm of my heart is beating like a drum

No never will I roam for I know my place is home
where the ocean meets the sky I'll be sailing

shifting like the handle of a slot machine

no expression on my face

count all the bees in the hive,
chase all the clouds from the sky.

got a honey jar stuck on his nose.

and from here no one knows where he goes.

how to loosen    a jar from the nose of a bear

Seem to follow throughout all our lives
After all's said and done I was watching my son
Sleeping there with my bear by his side
So I tucked him in, I kissed him and as I was going
I swear that the old bear whispered, boy welcome home
Believe me if you can

I live in a town called Millhaven, and it's small and it's mean and it's cold
But if you come around just as the sun goes down, you can watch the whole thing turn to gold
It's around then that I used to go a roaming
La la la la, la la la lie, all god's children they all gotta die
My name is Loretta but I prefer Lottie, I'm closing in on my fifteenth year
If you think that you seen a pair of eyes more green, then you sure haven't seen 'em around here
My hair is yellow and I'm always a-combing
La la la la, la la la lie, Mama often told me that we all got to die
You must have heard about the Curse Of Millhaven, how last Christmas Bill Blake's little boy didn't come home
They found him next week in One Mile Creek, his head bashed in and his pockets full of stones
Well, just imagine all the wailing and moaning
La la la la, la la la lie, even Bill Blake's boy, he had to die 
Then Professor O'Rye from Millhaven High, found nailed to his door his prize-winning terrier
Then next day the old fool brought little Biko to school, and we all had to watch as he buried her
Well his eulogy to Biko had all the tears a-flowing
La la la la, la la la lie, even god's little creatures, they have to die 
Our little town fell into a state of shock, a lot of people were saying things that made little sense
Then the next thing you know the head of Handyman Joe, was found in the fountain of the Mayor's residence
Well foul play can really get a small town going
La la la la, la la la lie, even god's children they have to die 
Then in a cruel twist of fate, old Mrs. Colgate was stabbed but the job was not complete...well the last
Thing she said before the cops pronounced her dead was ""my killer is Loretta & she lives across the street""
Twenty cops burst through my door without even phoning
La la la la, la la la lie, the young ones, the old ones, they all gotta die 
Yes it is I, Lottie, the Curse Of Millhaven, I've struck horror in the heart of this town
Like my eyes ain't green and my hair ain't yellow, it's more like the other way around
I gotta pretty little mouth underneath all the foaming
La la la la, la la la lie, sooner or later we all gotta die 
Since I was no bigger than a weevil they've been saying I was evil, that if ""bad"" was a boot that I'd fit it
That I'm a wicked young lady but I've been trying hard lately, oh fuck it! I'm a monster! I admit it!
Well it makes me so mad that my blood starts a-going
La la la la, la la la lie, Mama always told me that we all gotta die 
Well yeah, I drowned the Bailey kid, stabbed Mrs. Colgate, I admit--
Did the handyman with his circular saw in his garden shed--
But I never crucified little Biko, that was two junior high school psychos--
Stinky Bohoon and his friend with the pumpkin-sized head--
I'll sing to the lot, now you got me going
La la la la, la la la lie, all god's children have all gotta die 
There were all the others, all our sisters and brothers, you assumed were accidents, best forgotten
Recall the children who broke through the ice on Lake Tahoo?, Everyone assumed the warning signs had--
--followed em to the bottom
Well they're underneath the house where I do quite a bit of stowing
La la la la, la la la lie, even twenty little children, now they had to die 
And the fire of '91 that razed the Bella Vista slum, that was the biggest shit-fight this country's ever seen
Insurance companies ruined, land lords getting sued, all cause of wee girl with a can of gasoline
Those flames really roared when the winds started blowing
La la la la, la la la lie, well the rich man and the poor man, they all got to die 
Well I confessed to all these crimes and they put me on trial, I was laughing when they took me away
Off to the asylum in an old black Mariah, well it ain't home, but you know it's better than jail
It ain't such bad old place to have a home in
La la la la, la la la lie, all god's children they all gotta die
Now I got shrinks that will not rest with their endless Rorschach tests--
--I keep telling them that I think they're out to get me
They ask me if I feel remorse and I answer, ""Why of course! There is so much more I could have done--
--if they'd let me!""
So it's Rorschach and Prozac and everything is groovy
La la la la, la la la lie, all god's children they all have to die
La la la la, la la la lie, I'm happy as a lark and everything is fine

Om dagen kunne man lese langsomt i en bok
Om kvelden satt vi rundt et bord
Når du en gang kommer, neste sommer
skal jeg atter være her
Og vi skal synge gamle sanger om igjen
Når du en gang kommer, neste sommer
skal vi atter drikke vin
og vi skal snakke sammen, om de samme gamle ting
Det var en gang en sommer i nittenhundre og nittitre
hvor verden lå ufarlig langs Norges kyst et sted
på radioen var det et program om sommermat
vi ruslet ned og tok et bad
Når du en gang kommer, neste sommer
skal jeg atter være her
Og vi skal synge gamle sanger om igjen
Når du en gang kommer, neste sommer
skal vi atter drikke vin
og vi skal snakke sammen, om de samme gamle ting
Når du en gang kommer, neste sommer
skal jeg atter være her
Og vi skal synge gamle sanger om igjen
Når du en gang kommer, neste sommer
skal vi atter drikke vin
og vi skal snakke sammen, om de samme gamle ting

47,Heartbreak Station,Cinderella,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/cinderella/heartbreak-station-chords-160156,"  Waiting at the station,  tears filling up my eyes
  Sometimes the pain you hide burns like a fire inside
  Look out my window,  sometimes it's hard to see
  The things you want in life come and go so easily
She took the last train
  Out of my heart, ooh-ooh
She took the last train
  And now I think I'll make a brand new start
She took the last train
  Out of my heart
  Watching the days go by,  thinking 'bout the plans we made
  Days turn into years, funny how they fade away
  Sometimes I think of those days,  sometimes I just hide away
  Waiting on that 9:20 train, waiting on a memory
She took the last train
  Out of my heart, ooh-ooh
She took the last train
  And now I think I'll make a brand new start
She took the last train
  Out of my heart
My lady's on the fly
And she's never comin' back
My love is like a steam train
Rollin' down the tracks, yeah, yeah
She took the last train
  Out of my heart, ooh-ooh
She took the last train
  And now I think I'll make a brand new start
She took the last train
  Out of my heart
She took the last train
She took the last train
  ooh, out of my heart
She took the last train
She took the last train
  And now I think I'll make a new start
Last train
  Out of my heart

48,Фантом,Чиж & Co,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/2338299,"Я бегу по выжженной земле,
Гермошлем захлопнув на ходу.
Мой ""Фантом"" стрелою белой на распластанном крыле
С ревом набирает высоту.
Вижу голубеющую даль -
Нарушать такую просто жаль.
Жаль, что ты ее не видишь! Путь наш труден и далек.
Мой ""Фантом"" несется на восток.
Делаю я левый поворот,
Я теперь палач, а не пилот:
Нагибаюсь над прицелом - и ракеты мчатся к цели.
Впереди еще один заход.
Вижу в небе белую черту -
Мой ""Фантом"" теряет высоту.
Катапульта - вот спасенье! И на стропах - натяженье,
Сердце - в пятки: в штопор я иду.
Только приземлился, в тот же миг
Из кустов раздался дикий крик:
Желтолицые вьетнамцы верещат в кустах, как зайцы.
Я упал на землю и затих.
Вновь иду по проклятой земле.
Гермошлема нет на голове.
Сзади дулом автомата в спину тычут мне солдаты,
Жизнь моя висит на волоске.
""Кто же тот пилот, что меня сбил?"" -
Одного вьетнамца я спросил.
Отвечал мне тот раскосый, что командовал допросом:
""Сбил тебя наш летчик Ли Си Цын"".
Это вы, вьетнамцы, врете зря!
В шлемофоне четко слышал я:
""Коля, жми, а я накрою!"" - ""Ваня, бей, а я прикрою!""
Русский ас Иван подбил меня.
Где-то там вдали родной Техас,
Дома ждут меня отец и мать.
Мой ""Фантом"" взорвался быстро в небе голубом и чистом -
Мне теперь вас больше не видать...

The things that  you wanted    I bought them  for you
Graceless lady you know who I am
You know I can't let you  slide through my hands
Wild horses   couldn't drag me away
Wild horses   couldn't drag me away
I watched you suffer a dull aching pain
Now you've decided  to show me the same
No sweeping exits or offstage lines
Can make me feel bitter   or treat you unkind
Wild horses   couldn't drag me away
Wild wild horses    couldn't drag me away
Faith has been broken tears must be cried
Let's do some living     after we die
Wild horses   couldn't drag me away
Wild wild horses    couldn't drag me away
Wild wild horses   we'll ride them someday
Wild wild horses   we'll ride them someday

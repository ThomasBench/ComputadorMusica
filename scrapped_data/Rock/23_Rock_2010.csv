About all of those rich fuckboys

Of clothes and your jewelry

When I'm staring at my screen
At four AM
Trying not to fall asleep
And you hit me up just to see if I'm OK
I loved it way too goddamn much
When you told me you don't mind
When I keep you up
Sending Mamegoma Lines
You know it's shit like that that makes me wanna be alive
I wanna say I think it's OK if we just don't both feel the same way
But I feel like we're more than just friends
Cause it took six sad months to realize
I didn't miss the cold weather I just missed you and
I didn't miss the sweater weather I just missed you
(You, you)
(You, you)
(You, you)
(You, you)
I used to think I'd get by fine
Tryna hide what's on my mind
Friendships felt feigned and
Strangers' shapes seemed so unkind
I was alone in crowds but not alone in sentiment
I've been so isolated by
The time I trade to stay alive
Brought up with the choice
Of success or suicide
So I'll call in sick again just to spend the day with you
Wanna say I think it's so gay that we really both feel the same way
That I feel, like we're more than just friends
It took too long to realize
I didn't miss the cold weather I just missed you
I didn't miss the sweater weather I just missed you
I didn't miss Orange County, I just missed you
I didn't miss 69 Tarocco, I just missed you
I didn't miss Culver City, I just missed you
Or getting drunk outside the smell no I just missed you
Cuz I don't need the cold weather like I need you
And I don't need the sweater weather I just need you

Counting my footsteps praying the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky and go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone
Well I stopped picking up and this song is to let you know why
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known
Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said
Run as fast as you can
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with 
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong
Don't you think 19's too young to be played by
Your dark twisted games when I loved you so
I should've known
You are an expert at sorry
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry
Have tired, lifeless eyes
Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

And hope it's her when you turn around
But never, never on the day you leave
Love grows in the time it’s been
Since you last heard her sing
She'll cut her hair and move somewhere
She don't owe you anything
No, it's never on the day you leave
You can tell how it’s gonna be
To watch a girl become a ghost before your eyes
You wish you'd given her one more kiss
To put away for a night like this
But never, never on the day you leave
Love grows in the time it’s been
Since you last held her hand
She'll fight for you like hell then force herself
To like some other man
No, it's never on the day you leave
That you remember Christmas Eve
And all the things you miss about her crazy family
You'll know how lonely it is to see
A little drug store Christmas tree
But never, never on the day you leave
No never, never on the day you leave
So maybe it'd be better off to write her
And leave a little note right there beside her
That says ""Maybe we're not perfect, but I'll be
Damned if I ever leave
Damned if I ever leave
Damned if I ever leave""

We share friends in Soho
  She's a pain in the nose
  And I'm a pain in women's clothes
  You're a walking overdose in a great coat
  So she wrote a plan for it,  on the back of a fag packet
  She had to leave cos she couldn't hack it
Not enough noise and too much racket
""I think I've spent all my money and your friends""
  ""Oh how I'd love to go to Paris again
  And how I'd love to go to Paris again""
Mr. Serotonin Man, lend me a gram
You call yourself a friend?
""I've got two left feet and I'm starting to cheat
On my girlfriend again""
  I caught her picking her nose
As the crowd cheered for an overdose
And ""I don't suppose you know where this train goes""
  There was a party that she had to miss
  Because her friend kept cutting her wrists
 Hyper-politicized sexual trysts
""Oh, I think my boyfriend's a nihilist""
As I said ""Hey kids we're all just the same
  What a shame""
Ya know, and ""how I'd love to go to Paris again
And how I'd love to go to Paris again""
""Oh stop being an arshole
And counting my eye rolls""
They're like piss holes in the snow
  Keeping a tab on my health
Man you putting me up on a shelf
""Well I believe you're clean
But only by seeing your face for myself 
  Then she pointed at the bag of her dreams
  In a well posh magazine
  I said ""I'm done, babe. I'm out of the scene,""
But I was picking up on Bethnal Green
She said I've been romanticising heroin
And oh how I'd love to go to Paris, to paris again
  And how I'd love to go to Paris again
  And how I'd love to go to Paris again
  And how I'd love to go to Paris again

I knew a change had grown inside my awkwardly long limbs and bones

She said, ""All I can hope for is for me to get better,
because all I can take is no more.
I'll win him back again, we'll be lovers, best friends.
He won't need no other woman like he did way back when he was with me.

leaking tears over beers once again.""

I'm standing at the threshold of your dreams
Without me there'd be no sound from those amps
Without me there'd be no lights on the stage
But you don't applaud for me
I am the roadie:
A lonesome warrior searching for a soul (no!)
I am the roadie:
I make the rock go!
 Roadie,    Roadie,     ROAAADDDIEEEeee

49,Congratulations (ver 2),MGMT,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/mgmt/congratulations-chords-988437,"Dead in the water,  it's not a paid vacation
The sons and daughters of city officials attend demonstrations
It's hardly a sink or swim when all is well if the ticket sells
Out with a whimper,  it's not a blaze of glory
You look down from your temple as people endeavor to make it a story
And chisel the marble words that all is lost if it's never heard
But I've got someone to make reports
That tell me how my money's spent
To book my stays and draw my blinds
So I can't tell what's really there
And all I need's a great big congratulations
I'll keep your dreams, you pay attention for me
As strange as it seems, I'd rather dissolve than have you ignore me
The ground may be moving fast but I tied my boots to a broken mast
The difference is clear, you throw it in your cauldron
Rust and veneer, dusk and dawn, Steinways and Baldwins
You start with a simple stock of all the waste and salt to taste
But damn my luck and damn these friends
That keep on combing back their smiles
I save my grace with half-assed guilt
And lay down the quilt upon the lawn
Spread my arms and soak up congratulations

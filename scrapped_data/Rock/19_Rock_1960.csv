Window, hoping it would catch the eye

""Stories of cold,"" I smiled at the Hobo;
""Stories of old,"" I knelt to the Hobo;
And he stood before me in my fleeting house

Rock and roll music
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I got no kick against modern jazz
  Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until it sounds just like a symphony
That's why I go for that...
Rock and roll music
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I took my love on over 'cross the tracks
So she could hear a man a-wailin' sax
I must admit they had a rockin' band
Man, they were blowin' like a hurrican'
That's why I go for that
Rock and roll music
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Way down south they had a jubilee
And Georgia folks, they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' home brew from a wooden cup
The folks a' dancin' they got all shook up
And started playin' that...
Rock and roll music
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Don't get to hear 'em play a tango
I'm in no mood to take a mambo
It's way too early for the congo
So keep on rockin' that piano
That's why I go for that
Rock and roll music
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
All they got is rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me

She wouldn't dance with another

 Sail me on a silver sun where I know that I'm free

  Hard to find new words to say

  Nights of winter, turn me cold
  Fear the dying, getting old
  We ran the race, the race was won
       By running slowly
  Could be soon we'll cease to sound
  Slowly upstairs,   faster down
  Then to revisit stony grounds
       We used to know
  Remembering mornings, shillings spent
  Made no sense to leave the bed
  The bad old days they came and went
  Giving way to fruitful years
  Saving up the birds in hand
  While in the bush the others land
  Take what we can before the man
    Says it's time to go
  Each to his own way I'll go mine
  Best of luck with what you find
  But for your own sake remember times
    We used to know

When you’re tryin' to be so quiet?
We sit here stranded, though we’re all doin’ our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain, temptin’ you to defy it
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there’s nothing, really nothing to turn off
Just Louise and her lover so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind
In the empty lot where the ladies play
 Blindman’s bluff with the key chain
And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades out on the “D” train
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
Ask himself if it’s him or them that’s insane
Louise, she’s all right, she’s just near
She’s delicate and seems like the mirror
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna’s not here
The ghost of ’lectricity howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me
He’s sure got a lotta gall
To be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall while I’m in the hall
How can I explain? Oh, it’s so hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn
Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles
See the primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say, “Jeeze, I can’t find my knees”
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel
The peddler now speaks to the countess who’s pretending to care for him
Sayin’, “Name me someone that’s not a parasite and I’ll go out and say a prayer for him”
But like Louise always says
“Ya can’t look at much, can ya man?”, as she, herself, prepares for him
And Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road
He writes ev’rything’s been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads while my conscience explodes
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain
(fade out)

There goes Robert E. Lee!""

Yes I waited for you when you hated me.
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
When you knew I had some other place to be.

Where finaly delivered down to the penitentiary.
But to live outside the law, you must be honest.
I know you always say that you agree,

And now I stand here lookin' at your yellow railroad
In the ruins of your balcony,

Well I don't know how it happened,But the riverboat captain,he knows my fate
But ev'rybody else, even yourself, they're just gonna have to wait.

41,Gates Of Eden (ver 2),Bob Dylan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bob-dylan/gates-of-eden-chords-2117337,"Of war and peace the truth just twists
It's curfew gull it glides
Upon four-legged forest clouds
The cowboy angel rides
With his candle cradled into the sun
Though its glow is waxed in black
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden
The lamppost stands with folded arms
It's iron claws attached
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail
Though it shadows metal badge
All and all can only fall
With a crashing but meaningless blow
And no sound at all comes from the Gates of Eden
The savage soldier sticks his head
In sand and then complains
Unto the shoeless hunter who's
Gone deaf but still remains
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay
At ships with tattooed sails
Heading for the Gates of Eden
With a time-rusted compass blade
Aladdin and his lamp
Sits with Utopian hermit monks
Side saddle on the Golden Calf
And on their promises of paradise
You will not hear a laugh
All except inside the Gates of Eden
Relationships of ownership
They whisper in the wings
To those condemned to act accordingly
And wait for succeeding kings
And I try to harmonize with songs
The lonesome sparrow sings
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden
The motorcycle black Madonna
Two-wheeled gypsy queen
And her silver-studded phantom cause
The gray flannel dwarf to scream
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey
Who pick up on his bread crumb sins
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden
The kingdoms of experience
In the precious winds they rot
While paupers change possessions
Each one wishing for what the other has got
And the princess and the prince
Discuss what's real and what is not
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden
The foreign sun, it squints upon
A bed that is never mine
As friends and other strangers
From their fates try to resign
Leaving men wholly totally free
To do anything they wish to do but die
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden
At dawn my lover comes to me
And tells me of her dreams
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Into the ditch of what each one means
At times I think there are no words

42,Its Alright Ma Im Only Bleeding (ver 3),Bob Dylan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bob-dylan/its-alright-ma-im-only-bleeding-chords-1763134,"Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
The handmade blade, the child's balloon
Eclipses both the sun and moon
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fool's gold mouthpiece the hollow horn
Plays wasted words proves to warn
Temptation's page flies out the door
You follow, find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel to moan but unlike before
So don't fear if you hear
A foreign sound to your ear
It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing
As some warn victory, some downfall
Private reasons great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their mark
Made everything from toy guns that spark
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
Our preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
An' all the rules of the road have been lodged
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
And it's alright, Ma, I can make it
Advertising signs that con you
Into thinking you're the one
That can do what's never been done
That can win what's never been won
You lose yourself, you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand with nobody near
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit
To satisfy insure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not forget
Although the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to
For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Who despise their jobs, their destinies
Speak jealously of them that are free
While some on principles baptized
To strict party platform ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society's pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But I mean no harm nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him
Old lady judges watch people in pairs
Limited in sex, they dare
To push fake morals, insult and stare
While money doesn't talk, it swears
While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride, security
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed graveyards
False goals, I scuff at pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
And if my thought dreams could be seen
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only

Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
 In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you
Though I know the evenings empire has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me, I’m branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty streets too dead for dreaming
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
 In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels to be wanderin'
Im ready to go anywhere I’m ready for to fade
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way
I promise to go under it
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
 In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you
Though you might hear laughing, spinning
Swinging madly across the sun,
It’s not aimed at anyone, it’s just escaping on the run
And but for the sky, there are no fences facing
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it’s just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind
it’s just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
 In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come followin' you
Then take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted frightened trees, out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate, driven deep beneath the waves,
Let me forget about today until tommorow
Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.

 You walk into the room
 With your pencil in your hand
 You see somebody naked
And you say, “Who is that man?”
 You try so hard
But you don’t understand
Just what you’ll say
When you get home
 Because something is happening here
And you don't know what it is, 
Do you, Mister Jones
(see above)
 You raise up your head
 And you ask, “Is this where it is?”
 And somebody points to you and says
  “It’s his”
 And you say, “What’s mine?”
And somebody else says, “Where what is?”
And you say, “Oh my God
Am I here all alone?”
But something is happening
But you don’t know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones

 You hand in your ticket
 And you go watch the geek
 Who immediately walks up to you
  When he hears you speak
 And says, “How does it feel
To be such a freak?”
And you say, “Impossible”
As he hands you a bone
And something is happening here
But you don’t know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones
(see above)
  You have many contacts
  Among the lumberjacks
To get you facts
When someone attacks your imagination
  But nobody has any respect
  Anyway they already expect you
  To just give a check
To tax-deductible charity organizations
 You’ve been with the professors
And they’ve all liked your looks
 With great lawyers you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
 You’ve been through all of
F. Scott Fitzgerald’s books
 You’re very well read
It’s well known
But something is happening here
But you don’t know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones
(see above)
Well, the sword swallower, he comes up to you
 He crosses himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says, “Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan”
 And you know something is happening 
But you don’t know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones
(see above)
 Now you see this one-eyed midget
 Shouting the word “NOW”
 And you say, “For what reason?”
 And he says, “How?”
 And you say, “What does this mean?”
And he screams back, “You’re a cow
Give me some milk
Or else go home”
 And you know something is happening 
But you don’t know what it is
 Do you, Mister Jones
(see above)
Well, you walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
 You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
 There ought to be a law
Against you comin’ around
You should be made
To wear earphones
 ‘Cause something is happening
But you don’t know what it is

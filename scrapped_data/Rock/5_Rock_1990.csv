 Insanity it seems             Has got me by my soul to squeeze
 Well all the love from me     With all the dying trees I scream
 The angels in my dreams       Have turned to demons of greed that's me
 Where I go I just don't know
 I got to got to gotta take it slow
 When I find my peace of mind
 I'm gonna give you some of my good time
 Today love smiled on me      It took away my pain say please
 Oh let your ride be free     You've got to let it be oh yeah
 Where I go I just don't know
 I got to got to gotta take it slow
 When I find my peace of mind
 I'm gonna give you some of my good time
 You're so polite indeed        Well I got everything I need
 Oh make my days a breeze     And take away my self destruction
It's bitter baby and it's very sweet
I'm on a roller coaster but I'm on my feet
Take me to the river let me on your shore
I'll be coming back baby I'll be coming back for more
Doo doo doo doo dingle zing a dong bone,
a-di ba-da ba-zumba crunga cone gone bad,
I could not forget but I will not endeavor
Simple pleasures aren't that special, but I won't regret it never
 Where I go I just don't know
 I got to got to gotta take it slow
 When I find my peace of mind
 I'm gonna give you some of my good time
Where I go I just don't know
I might end up somewhere in Mexico
When I found my peace of mind
I'm gonna keep it for the end of time

  In-lab ako sa isang kolehiyala
  Hindi ko maintindihan
  Wag na nating idaan sa ""maboteng"" usapan

  Anong sarap, kami'y naging magkaibigan
  Napuno ako ng pag-asa

  Dehins ako naniwala
  Di nagtagal, naging ganun na rin ang tema
  Kulang na lang ay sagot niya
  Ba't ba ang labo niya, di ko maipinta
  Hanggang kelan maghihintay, ako ay nabuburat na.
  Pero, minamahal ko siya
  Di biro, T.L. ako sa kanya
  Alam kong nababaduyan ka na sa mga sinasabi ko
  Pero sana naman ay maintindihan mo.
  O pare ko (o pare ko), meron ka bang maipapayo
  Kung wala ay okey lang (kung wala ay okey lang)
  Kailangan lang ay (kailangan lang) ang iyong pakikiramay

Singing ""Cathy's Clown""
That's the man she's married to now
That's the girl that he takes around town
She appears composed so she is I suppose

She shows no emotion at all
Stares into space like a dead china doll

Cos I'm doing just fine, hour to hour, note to note
Here it is the revenge to the tune

You're no good, you're no good, you're no good

Looking out on the substitute scene
Still going strong

To just leave me alone

And letters that you never meant to send
Get lost or thrown    away
And now we're grown up orphans

We don't belong to no one

But you could hide beside me
Maybe for a while

And I won't tell em your name

The past is never      far
Did you lose yourself somewhere out there
Did you get to be  a      star
And don't it make you sad to know that life
Is more than who we     are
You grew up way too fast
And now there's nothing to believe
And reruns all become our history
A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio

Ovation her own motivation
She comes around and she goes down on me
And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do
Coming over you
Keep on smiling what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you
And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show takes the stage
I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life baby, baby
I want something else, I'm not listening
when you say good~~~bye

I was taking sips of it through my nose
Some place back there
Smiling in the pictures you would take
Doing crystal meth will lift
It won't stop I won't come down
I keep stock with a tick-tock
And then I bumped up
I took the hit that I was given
Then I bumped again
  How do I get back there to
The place where I
fell asleep inside you?
How do I get myself back to
The place where you said
I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life baby, baby
I want something else, I'm not listening
when you say Good~~~bye
I believe in the sand
beneath my toes
An earthy feeling
I believe in the
faith that grows
chords can make me cry
When I'm with you I
feel like I could die
all right,   all right
and when the plane came in
She said she was crashing
The velvet it rips in
the city we tripped
On the urge to feel alive
But now I'm struggling
Those days you were wearing
That velvet dress
You're the priestess
I must confess
Those little red panties
They pass the test
One...
And you hold me, and we're broken.
Still it's all that I wanna do, just a little now!
Feel myself head
made of the ground
down, no     no, and I won't
run for my life
She's got her jaws now
locked down in a smile
But nothing is alright,   alright
I want something else
To get me through this
 life, baby
I want something else
when you say goodbye
goodbye
goodbye
goodbye

Where were they going without even
Knowing the way?

They wanted the highway

And they couldn't find them
They left before the sun came up that day
They just drove off and left it all behind'em
But where were they going without ever
Knowing the way?

into the fog where no-one notices
the contrast of white on white.
And in between the moon and you
The angels get a better view
of the crumbling difference between wrong and right.
I walk in the air, between the rain
through myself and back again.
Where?             I don't know.
Maria says she's dying.
Through the door I hear her crying
Why?               I don't know
Round here we always stand up straight
Round here, something radiates.
 Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand
She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis
She walks along the edge where the ocean meets the land
just like she's walking on a wire in the circus
She parks her car outside of my house
says she's close to understanding Jesus
She knows she's more than just a little misunderstood
She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous
Round here we're carving out our names
Round here we all look the same
Round here we talk just like lions
But we sacrifice like lambs
Round here she's slipping through my hands
    Round here
Sleeping children better run like the wind
Out of the lightning dream                           
Mama's little baby better get herself in
Out of the lightning
 She says, ""It's only in my head.""
She says, ""shh...I know it's only in my head.""
But the girl on the car in the parking lot
says: ""Man, you should try to take a shot
Can't you see my walls are crumbling?""
Then she looks up at the building
Say's she's thinking of jumping
She says she's tired of life;
She must be tired of something.
Round here she's always on my mind
Round here I got lots of time
Round here we're never sent to bed early
Man, nobody makes us wait
round here we stay up very, very, very, very late.
I, I can't see nothin', nothin'
Around here
You catch me if I'm falling,
You catch me if I'm falling,
Will you catch me cause I'm falling down on you
I said I'm under the gun
around here
Oh, man I said I'm under the gun
Around here
And I can't see nothin',nothin'
Round here.

And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars

strap shoes on my feet

Got to find the reason
why my money's all gone
I got a dalmatian
I can still get high
I can play the guitar
Like a motherfuckin' riot
Life is too short
So love the one you got
Cause you might get run over
or you might get shot
Never start static
I just get it off my chest
Never had to battle with my
bulletproof vest 
Take a small example 
Take a tip from me
Take all of your money
Give it up to charity
Love is what I got 
Is with in my reach
the sub rock styles
dealt straight from Long Beach
It come back to you 
You're gonna get what you deserve
Try'n test that 
Your bound to get served
Love's what I got
Don't start a riot
You'll feel it when
the dance get's hot
Love is
What I got

Love is 
What I got
Now remember that

When my dog runs away
Bout the bills I have to pay
Don't get angry
when my mom smokes pot
Hits the bottle 
and goes right to the rock
Fuck it, fight it
It's all the same
Livin with Louey Dog's 
The only way to stay sane
Let the lovin' 
Let the lovin come back to me

About the things caught in my mind
As the day was dawning my plain flew away
With all the things caught in my mind
And I don't wanna be there when you're coming down
And I don't wanna be there when you hit the ground
So don't go away, say what you say
But say that you'll stay, forever and a day
In the time of my life, cause I need more time
Yes I need more time just to make things right
Damn my situation and the games I have to play
With all the things caught in my mind
Damn my education I can't find the words to say
About the things caught in my mind
And I don't wanna be there when you're coming down
And I don't wanna be there when you hit the ground

I wrote her off for the tenth time today
And practice all the things I would say
When she came over I lost my nerve
I took her back and made her dessert
Now I know I'm being used
That's okay man cause I like the abuse
I know she's playing with me
That's okay 'cause I got no self esteem
We make plans to go out at night
I wait till 2 then I turn out the light
All this rejection's got me so low
If she keeps it up I just might tell her so
When she's saying oh that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying oh that I'm like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well I Guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer, the more it shows you really care 
Right? Yeah yeah yeah...
Now I'll relate this little bit
That happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night she knocks on my door
She's drunk again and looking to score
Now I know I should say no
But that's kind of hard when she's ready to go
I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb
I'm just a sucker with no self esteem
When she's saying oh that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying oh that I'm like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well I Guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer, the more it shows you really care

 How we break each other's hearts

 How we take each other's love

 And because of all their tears
  Their eyes can't hope to see

That's where I caught her eye
She told me that her dad was loaded
She said ""fine"" and in a thirty seconds time she said
""I want to live like common people
I want to do whatever common people do
I want to sleep with common people like you""
Well, what else could I do? I said ""I'll see what I can do""
I took her to a supermarket
I don't know why but I had to start it somewhere - so it started there
I said ""Pretend you've got no money""
I said ""Yeah, well I can't see someone else smiling in here
Are you sure you want to live like common people
You want to see whatever common people see
You want to sleep with common people like me""
But she didn't understand, she just smiled and held my hand
Rent a flat above your shop, cut your hair and get a job
Smoke some fags and play some pool, pretend you never went to school
But still, you'll never get it right, 'cos when you're laid in bed at night
watching roaches climb the wall, if you called your dad he could stop it all
You'll never live like common people
You'll never do whatever common people do
You'll never watch your life slide out of view
And dance and drink and screw because there's nothing else to do
Sing along with the common people,
Sing along and it might just get you thru
Laugh along even though they are laughing at you
Because you think that poor is cool
Like a dog lying in a corner, they will bite you and never warn you
look out, they'll tear your insides out
'Cos everybody hates a tourist especially one who thinks that it's all
Such a laugh
you will never understand how it feels to live your life
With no meaning or control and with nowhere left to go
You are amazed that they exist and they burn so bright
Whilst you can only wonder why
Rent a flat above your shop, cut your hair and get a job
Smoke some fags and play some pool, pretend you never went to school
But still, you'll never get it right, 'cos when you're laid in bed at night

     Maybe my connection is tired of taking his chances
     Yeah there's a storm on the loose, sirens in my head
     Wrapped in silence all circuits are dead
     Cannot decode my whole life spins into a frenzy
     Help I'm stepping into the twilight zone

     Double crossed messenger all alone
     Can't get no connection, can't get through where are you
     Well the night weighs heavy on his guilty mind
     This far from the border line
     When the hit man comes he knows damn well he has been cheated and he says

And I know just how to scheme
I know just when to face the truth
And then I know just when to dream
And I know just where to touch you
And I know just what to prove
I know when to pull you closer
And I know when to let you lose
And I know the night is fading
And I know the time's gonna fly

But I know I gotta give it a try
And I know the roads to riches
And I know the ways to fame
I know all the rules and then I know how to break them
And I always know the name of the game
But I don't know how to leave you
And I'll never let you fall

Are streaming through the waves in your hair
And every star in the sky
Is taking aim at your eyes like a spotlight
The beating of my heart is a drum and it's lost
And it's looking for a rhythm like you
You can take the darkness from the pit of the night
And turn it to a beacon burning endlessly bright
Cause everything I own, now
It`s nothing till I give it to you
I can make the run or stumble,
I can make the final block;
And I can make every tackle, at the sound of the whistle,
I can make all the stadiums rock
I can make tonight forever
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn
And I can make you every promise that has ever been made
And I can make all your demons be gone
But I'm never gonna make it without you
Do you really wanna see me crawl
And I'm never gonna make it like you do
Making love out of nothing at all

Out of nothing at all (making love)

So many mothers sighing
News had just come over
We had 5 years left to cry in
 I heard telephones, opera house, favorite melodies
 I saw boys, toys, electric irons and T.V's

 I had to cram so many things to store ev'ry thing in there
And all the fat-skinny people,
and all the tall-short people
And all the nobody people,
and all the somebody people
many people.""
A girl my age went off her head,
hit some tiny children
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off,
I think she would have killed them
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
Stone love - she kneels before the grave
A brave son - who gave his life to see the slogan
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving
New love - a boy and girl are talking
New words - that only they can share in
New words - a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep - through the fleeting hours of morning
Love is careless in its choosing 
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none, just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love - and love is not loving
Soul love - the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love - and how my God on high is
All love - though reaching up my loneliness evolves
By the blindness that surrounds him
Love is careless in its choosing 
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none, just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love - and love is not loving
              I'm an alligator,
              I'm a mama-papa comin' for you
I'm a space invader, I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut, you're sqauwkin' like a pink monkey bird
and I'm busting up my brains for the words
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
   Freak out in a moonage daydream oh! yeah!
Keep your 'lectric eye on me babe
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love

Didn't know what time it was the lights were low-ow-ow.
 I lean back on my radio-o-o
 Some cat was laying down some rock'n'roll,
'Lotta soul' he said. 
 Then the loud sound did seem to fa-a-ade
 Came back like a slow voice on a wave of pha-a-ase
 That weren't no DJ that was hazy cosmic jive.
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds.
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it all worthwhile,
   ""Let the children lose it, let the children use it,
   Let the children boogie.""
  Well I had to phone someone so I picked on you-ou-ou
  Hey that's far out, so you heard him too-oo-oo
  Switch on the TV we may pick him on Channel 2.
  Look out your window I can see his li-i-ight,
  If we can sparkle he may land toni-i-ight,
 Don't tell your papa or he'll get us locked up in a fright. 
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds.
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it all worthwhile,
   ""Let the children lose it, let the children use it,
   Let the children boogie.""
   Starman waiting in the sky
He'd like to come and meet us
But he thinks he'd blow our minds.
There's a starman waiting in the sky
He's told us not to blow it
'Cause he knows it all worthwhile,
   ""Let the children lose it, let the children use it,

La la la la la, la la la la, la la la la, la la la la
When you climb to the top of the mountain
Look out over the sea 
Think about the places perhaps where a young man could be
Then you jump back down to the rooftops
Look out over the town
Think about all of the strange things circulating round 
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to get to heaven when you're going down
Well all the people have got their problems
That ain't nothing new
With the help of the good Lord we can all pull on through
We can all pull on through
Get there in the end
Sometimes it'll take you right up and sometimes down again
Satisfaction, satisfaction
Keep me satisfied
I've got the love of a Hoochie Coochie woman she calling from inside
She's a-calling from inside
Trying to get to you
All the woman really wants you can give her something too
People stared at the makeup on his face
Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
And lady stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and disgrace
And he was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, the songs went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight
And he sang all night long
Ooh, how I sighed when they asked if I knew his name
1.  Tony went to fight in Belfast
1. Rudi stayed at home to starve
1. I  could  make  it       all   worthwhile  as  a    rock & roll star
 So                           inviting 
 so                       enticing         to play the 
part              I could  play the wild mutation as a rock & roll star
                       Get it all yeah!     Oh yeah
I could do with the money
I'd send my photograph to my honey  and  I'd c'mon like a regular superstar
  I could fall asleep at night as a rock & roll star
Bum bum Just watch me bum
Well she's a tongue twisting storm, she will come to the show tonight
Praying to the light machine
She wants my honey not my money, she's a funky-thigh collector 
Laying on electric dreams
Well come on, come on, we've really got a good thing going
Well come on, well come on, if you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yours..e..lf
We can't dance, we don't talk much, we just ball and play
But then we move like tigers on vaseline
Well the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
You're the blessed, we're The Spiders From Mars
Well come on, come on, we've really got a good thing going
Well come on, well come on, if you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yours..e..lf
                Lay it on come on...
Well come on, come on, we've really got a good thing going
Well come on, well come on, if you think we're gonna make it
You better hang on to yours..e..lf
 Now Ziggy played guitar,
  Jamming good with Weird and Gilly,
And the Spiders from Mars.
He played it left hand,
But made it too far.
Became the special man,
Then we were Ziggy's band.
like some cat from Japan.
  So where were the spiders,
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us,
 so  we bitched about his fans
and should we crush his sweet hands?
Yeah...         ooo.... 
ZIGGY PLAYED GUITAR!
Hey Man             Leave me a-lone you know
Hey Man  Oh Henry  Get off the phone I gotta
Hey Man, I gotta
Straighten my face This mellow thighed chick just put my
Spine out of place
Oh don't lean on me man cuz you can't afford the ticket
I'm back on Suffragette City
Well don't lean on me man cuz you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Its outa sight she's all right
Hey Man  ah Henry,  don't  be  unkind, go Away
Hey Man  ah i can't take you this time, no way
Hey Man, ah droogie
Don't crash here Theres only room for one
and here she comes here she come
Time takes a cigarette  puts it in your mouth
You pull on your finger, then another finger, then your cigarette
  The wall to wall is calling  it lingers, then you forget
Oh  you're a rock'n roll suicide
     You're too old to lose it  too young to choose it
And the clock waits so patiently on your song
  You walk past a cafe but you don't eat when you lived too long
Oh no no no you're a rock'n roll suicide
     Chev brakes are snarling  as you stumble across the road
But the day breaks instead so you hurry home
  Don't let the sun blast your shadow
don't let the milk floats ride your mind                 EADGBE
So natural religiously unkind
Oh no love you're not alone
You're watching yourself but you're too unfair
you got your head all tangled but if I could only make you care
Oh no love you're not alone
no matter what or who you've been
no matter when or where you've seen
all the knives to lacerate your brain
I've had my share  I'll help you with the pain  you're not alone
                 Just turn on me  you're
not alone          let's turn on me and be

  She said, “Baby, can't you see.
  I wanna be famous, a star of the screen.
But you can do something in between.”
Baby, you can drive my car.      Yes, I'm gonna be a star.
Baby, you can drive my car,      and maybe I’ll love you.
  I told that girl that my prospects were good.
  She said, “Baby, it's understood.
  Working for peanuts is all very fine,
But I can show you a better time.”
Baby, you can drive my car.      Yes, I'm gonna be a star.
Baby, you can drive my car,      and maybe I’ll love you.    Beep, beep.
Mmm. Beep, beep. Yeah!
Baby, you can drive my car.      Yes, I'm gonna be a star.
Baby, you can drive my car,      and maybe I’ll love you.
  I told that girl I could start right away.
  And she said, “Listen, Babe, I’ve got something to say.
  I got no car, and it's breaking my heart.
But I've found a driver, and that's a start.”
Baby, you can drive my car.      Yes, I'm gonna be a star.

I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me.
She showed me her room, isn't it good, Norweg-ian wood.
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere.
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair.
I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
We talked until two and then she said, ""It's time for bed.""
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath.
And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown.
So I lit a fire, isn't it good, Norweg-ian wood.
When I call you up, your line's engaged. I have had enough,
So act your age. We have lost the time, that was so hard to find.
And I will lose my mind, if you won't see me. (You won't see  me.)
You won't see me.
I don't know why you should want to hide. But I can't get through,
My hands are tied. I won't want to stay. I don't have much to say.
But I can turn away, and you won't see me. (You won't see   me.)
You won't see me.
Time after time you refuse to even listen.
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missing.
Though the days are few, they're filled with tears. And since I lost you, 
It feels like years. Yes, it seems so long, Girl, since you've been gone.
And I just can't go on, if you won't see me. (You won't see   me.)
You won't see me. (You won't see   me.)
Time after time you refuse to even listen.

Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody.
Doesn't have a point of view, knows not where he's going to.
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, please listen. You don't know what you're missing.
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command.
He's as blind as he can be, just sees what he wants to see.
Nowhere Man can you see me at all?
Nowhere Man, don't worry. Take your time, don't hurry.
Leave it all till somebody else lends you a hand.

I've got a word or two,   to say about the things that you do.
   You're telling all those lies,
   About the good things that we can have if we close our eyes.
Do what you want to do, and go where you're going to.
Think for yourself, 'cause I won't be there with you.
I left you far behind,   the ruins of the life that you have in mind.
   And though you still can't see,
   I know your mind's made up, you're gonna cause more misery.
Do what you want to do, and go where you're going to.
Think for yourself, 'cause I won't be there with you.
Although your mind's opaque,  try thinking more if just for your own sake.
   The future still looks good,
   And you've got time to rectify all the things that you should.
Do what you want to do, and go where you're going to.
Think for yourself, 'cause I won't be there with you.
Do what you want to do, and go where you're going to.
Think for yourself, 'cause I won't be there with you.

Say the word and you'll be free. Say the word and be like me.
Say the word I'm thinking of. Have you heard, the word is love?
It's so    fine, it's sun - shine. It's the word, love.
  In the beginning I misunderstood.
  But now I've got it, the word is good.
Spread the word and you'll be free. Spread the word and be like me.
Spread the word I'm thinking of. Have you heard, the word is love?
It's so    fine, it's sun - shine. It's the word, love.
Everywhere I go I hear it said.
 In the good and the bad books that I have read.
Say the word and you'll be free. Say the word and be like me.
Say the word I'm thinking of. Have you heard, the word is love?
It's so    fine, it's sun - shine. It's the word, love.
Now that I know what I feel must be right,
 I'm here to show everybody the light.
Give the word a chance to say, that the word is just the way.
It's the word I'm thinking of. And the only word is love.
It's so    fine, it's sun - shine. It's the word, love.
Say the word,     love.   Say the word,     love.
Say the word,     love.   Say the word,          love.

I need to, I need to, I need to.     I need to make you see.
   Oh, what you mean to me.      Until I do I'm hoping  you will
Know what I    mean.     I love you.
I want you, I want you, I want you.    I think you know by now.
   I'll get to you somehow.     Until I do  I'm telling you so
You'll un-  der- stand.

You are tearing me apart,    when you treat me so unkind.
What goes on,           in your mind?

But when I saw him with you I could feel my future fold.

But now the tide is turning, I can see that I was blind.
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie.      Tell me why.
What goes on,    in your heart?
I used to think of no-one else, but you were just the same.
You didn't even think of me as someone with a name.
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die.      Tell me why.
What goes on in your heart?     What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart,    when you treat me so unkind.
What goes on,           in your mind?

Is there anybody going to listen to my story,
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much, it makes you sorry.
Still you don't regret a single day.
Ah, Girl.                    Girl, girl.
When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her,
She will turn to me and start to cry.
And she promises the earth to me and I believe her.
After all this time I don't know why.
Ah, Girl.                    Girl, girl.
She's the kind of girl who puts you down, when friends are there,
You feel a fool.               When you say she's looking good,
She acts as if it's understood, she's cool. Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Girl.                    Girl, girl.
Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said,
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?
Ah, Girl.                    Girl, girl.
             Ah,  Girl.                    Girl, girl.
  I'm looking through you,   where did you go?
  I thought I knew you,   what did I know?
  You don't look diffe - rent, but you have changed.
  I'm looking through you,   you're not the same.
  Your lips are moving,   I cannot hear.
  Your voice is soothing,   but the words aren't clear.
  You don't sound diffe - rent, I've learned the game.
  I'm looking through you,   you're not the same.
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight.
  You're thinking of me,   the same old way.
  You were above me,   but not today.
  The only diffe - rence is you're down there.
  I'm looking through you,   and you're nowhere.
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight.
  I'm looking through you,   where did you go?
  I thought I knew you,   what did I know?
  You don't look diffe - rent, but you have changed.
  I'm looking through you,   you're not the same.
Yeah, 'a, Baby, you’ve changed.
           Ah,   I'm looking through you.
           Yeah,   I'm looking through you.
There are places I'll remember,   all my life,
Though some have changed. Some forever, not for better. 
Some have gone,   and some remain.
All these places had their moments, with lovers and friends,
I still can recall. Some are dead, and some are living.
In my life, I've loved them all.
But of all these friends and lovers,   there is no - one,
Compares with you. And these memories lose their meaning,
When I think of love as something new.
Though I know I'll never lose affection, for people and things,
That went before. I know I'll often stop and think about them.
In my life, I love you more.
Though I know I'll never lose affection, for people and things,
That went before. I know I'll often stop and think about them.
In my life, I love you more.

It's been a long time, now, I'm, coming back home.
I've been away  now, oh, how, I've been alone.
Wait,   till I come back to your side.
   We'll forget the tears we cried.
But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away.
And if your heart's strong, hold on,  I won't delay.
Wait,   till I come back to your side.
   We'll forget the tears we cried.
I feel as though, you ought to know,
That I've been good, as good as I can be.
And if you do, I'll trust in you,
And know that you will wait for me.
It's been a long time, now, I'm, coming back home.
I've been away  now, oh, how, I've been alone.
Wait,   till I come back to your side.

That I've been good, as good as I can be.
And if you do, I'll trust in you,
And know that you will wait for me.
But if your heart breaks, don't wait, turn me away.
And if your heart's strong, hold on,  I won't delay.
Wait,   till I come back to your side.
   We'll forget the tears we cried.
It's been a long time, now, I'm, coming back home.
I've been away  now,  oh,  how,  I've been alone.
If I needed someone to love, you're the one that I'd be thinking of.
If I needed someone.         If I had some more time to spend,
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend.    If I needed someone.
Had you come some other day, then it might not have been like this.
But you see now I'm too much in love.
Carve your number on my wall, and maybe you will get a call from me.
If I needed someone.

You’d better run for your life if you can, little girl.
Hide your head in the sand, little girl.

Alone above a raging sea

You never let me down,
You've turned my life around.
The sweetest days I've found
I've found with you.

I've never been afraid,
I've loved the life we've made
And I'm so glad I've stayed right here with you
Through the years.
I can't remember what I used to do,
Who I trusted, who I listened to before.
I swear you've taught me everything I know
I can't imagine needing someone so.
But through the years it seems to me
I need you more and more.
Through the years,
Through all the good and bad,
I knew how much we had,
I've always been so glad to be with you.
Through the years
It's better everyday,
You've kissed my tears away,
As long as it's okay, I`ll stay with you
Through the years.
Through the years
When everything went wrong,
Together we were strong,
I know that I belong right here with you
Through the years
I never had a doubt
We'd always work things out.
I've learned what love's about by loving you
Through the years.

Where the supermarket used to stand.
Before that they put up a bowling alley
On the site that used to be the local Palais.
That's where the big bands used to come and play.
My sister went there on a Saturday.
Come dancing,
All her boyfriends used to come and call.
Why not come dancing? it's only natural
Another Saturday, another date.
She would be ready but she's always make them wait.
In the hallway, in anticipation,
He didn't know the night would end up in frustration.
He'd end up blowing all his wages for the week
All for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek.
Come dancing,
That's how they did it when I was just a kid,
And when they said come dancing, my sister always did.
My sister should have come in at midnight,
And my mom would always sit up and wait.
It always ended up in a big row
When my sister used to get home late.
(spoken) Out of my window I can see them in the moonlight,
Two silhouettes saying goodnight by the garden gate. (Mom yells at them...)
The day they knocked down the pally
My sister stood and cried.
The day they knocked down the pally
Part of my childhood died, just died.
Now I'm grown up and playing in a band,
And there's a car park where the pally used to stand.
My sister's married and she lives on an estate.
Her daughters go out, now it's her turn to wait.
She knows they get away with things she never could,
But if I asked her I wonder if she would,
Come dancing,
Come on sister, have yourself a ball.
Don't be afraid to come dancing, it's only natural.
Come dancing,
Just like the pally on a Saturday.
And all her friends will come dancing
Where the big bands used to play.

42,Southern Cross (ver 3),"Crosby, Stills & Nash",https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/crosby-stills-nash/southern-cross-chords-1053305,"Got out of town on a boat gon' to southern islands.
Sailing a reach before a following sea.
She was making for the trades on the outside,
And the downhill run to Papeete.
Off the wind on this heading lie the Marquesas.
We got eighty feet of waterline nicely making way.
In a noisy bar in Avalon, I tried to call you,
But on a midnight watch I realized why twice you ran away. (think about)
Think about how many times I have fallen.
Spirits are using me; larger voices callin'.
What heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten.
I have been around the world, lookin' for that woman-girl
Who knows love can endure.
And you know it will.
And you know it will
When you see the Southern Cross for the first time,
You understand now why you came this way.
'Cause the truth you might be runnin' from is so small,
But it's as big as the promise, the promise of a comin' day.
So I'm sailing for tomorrow. My dreams are a-dying.
And my love is an anchor tied to you, tied with a silver chain.
I have my ship, and all her flags are a-flying.
She is all that I have left, and music is her name. (think about)
Think about how many times I have fallen.
Spirits are using me; larger voices callin'.
What heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten.
I have been around the world, lookin' for that woman-girl
Who knows love can endure.
And you know it will.
And you know it will
So we cheated and we lied and we tested.
And we never failed to fail; it was the easiest thing to do.
You will survive being bested.
Somebody fine will come along make me forget about loving you
In the Southern Cross.

Carried away by a moonlight shadow
He passed on worried and warning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Lost in a riddle that Saturday night
Far away on the other side.
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through
The trees that whisper in the evening
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
Far away on the other side.
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through
  I stay I pray
See you in heaven far away
  I stay I pray
See you in heaven one day
Four am in the morning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
I watched your vision forming
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Star was light in a silvery night
Far away on the other side
Will you come to talk to me this night
But she couldn't find how to push through
  I stay I pray
See you in heaven far away
  I stay I pray
See you in heaven one day

Caught in the middle of a hundred and five
The night was heavy and the air was alive
But she couldn't find how to push through

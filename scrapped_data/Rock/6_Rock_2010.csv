I don’t play by the rules of the game
So you say, I’m just trying
Just try... ... ing
So I heard you are my sister’s friend
You get along quite nicely
You ask me why I cut my hair
And changed myself completely (slower)
I don’t know my name
I don’t play by the rules of the game
So you say, I’m just trying
Just try... ... ing
I went from bland and popular to
Joining the marching band
I made the closest friends I'll ever
Have in my lifetime
    I am lost
    Trying to get found
    In an ocean of
People...
    Please don't ask me any...questions
There won't be a valid answer
I'll just say...
I don’t know my name
I don’t play by the rules of the game
So you say, I’m just trying (a little faster)
Just try... ... ing (faster and louder)
I now know my name
I don’t play by the rules of the game
So you say, I’m not trying

1,Every Breaking Wave,U2,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/u2/every-breaking-wave-chords-1519492,"Every breaking wave on the shore
tells the next one there’ll be one more.
And every gambler knows that to lose
is what you’re really there for.
Summer I was fearlessness,
now I speak into an answer phone.
Like every falling leaf on the breeze,
winter wouldn’t leave it alone, alone.
If you go?
If you go your way and I go mine.
Are we so?
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby every dog on the street
knows that we’re in love with defeat.
Are we ready to be swept off our feet?
And stop chasing every breaking wave..
Every sailor knows that the sea
is a friend made enemy.
And every shipwrecked soul knows what it is
to live without intimacy.
I thought I heard the captain’s voice,
it’s hard to listen while you preach.
Like every broken wave on the shore, 
this is as far as I could reach..
If you go?
If you go your way and I go mine.
Are we so?
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby every dog on the street
knows that we’re in love with defeat.
Are we ready to be swept off our feet?
And stop chasing every breaking wave..
The sea knows where are the rocks, and drowning is no sin.
You know where my heart is, the same place that yours has been.
We know that we fear to win, and so we end before we begin,
before we begin..
If you go?
If you go your way and I go mine.
Are we so?
Are we so helpless against the tide?
Baby every dog on the street
knows that we’re in love with defeat..
Are we ready to be swept off our feet?
And stop chasing every breaking wave..

A part of me I'd never seen.
You took my soul and wiped it clean.

I can't retrace how I got here
I cheat the light to check my face
It's slightly harder than last year
And all at once it gets hard to take
It gets hard to fake what I won't be
Cause one of these days I'll be born and raised
And it's such a waste to grow up lonely
I still have dreams, they're not the same
They don't fly as high as they used to
I saw my friend, he's in my head
And he said, ""You don't remember me, do you?""
Then all at once it gets hard to take
It gets hard to fake what I won't be
Cause one of these days I'll be born and raised
And it's such a waste to grow up lonely
I still got time, I still got faith
I call on both of my brothers
I got a mom, I got a dad
But they do not have each other
So line on up, and take your place
And show your face to the morning
Cause one of these days you'll be born and raised
And it all comes on without warning

We're floating away, my body's in space
We are going home

Meteor shower, Quick take cover

I'd sell my own bones for sapphire stones
Cause blue's your favourite colour

It starts with Love and it ends with U
But don't go outside, it's dangerous tonight

Which way to go

Fine

I get my feelings involved, she stopped returnin' my calls
And flaws turned into walls and barricades
And I'm too far gone and over both ways
And now every long day is a bad one
I can't make you call or make you stay
Or take you off the pedestal
So I get lost in modern music watchin' movies, talkin' to the walls in my room
Walkin' through the halls in my head, just tryna make sure it all makes sense

For reasons wretched and divine
She blows out of nowhere roman candle of the wild
Laughing her way through my feeble disguise
No other version of me I would rather be tonight
And lord she found me just in time
Cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and done
I need to be youthfully felt 'cause god I never felt young
She's gonna save me call me 'baby' run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy soothe me daily better yet she wouldn't care
We'll steal a Lexus be detectives ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson raise 'em on rhythm and blues
Lord it'd be great to find a place we could escape sometime
Me and my Isis growing black irises in the sunshine
Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside
Sit back and watch the world go by
Happy to lie back watch it burn and rust

 seemed like loneliness was all we'd ever do

 Twenty dollars in a souvenir
Anything’s worth trying
To stay out of your nightmares
Say I was in your dream last night
Always end up dying

Always managed to move in
Right next to cemeteries
And never far from a hospital, I don't know what
that tells you about me
Pulling thorns out of my palm
Work a midnight surgery
When you cut a hole into my skull
Do you hate what you see?
Like I do

Left to be a rock and roll star

Wise little smile that spoke so safely
He booked a one way ticket
Out west that's where they make it
Six kids stuck in a bedsit
To sunswept poolside riches
He met a girl who wore Versace
Pink feather coats and jumbo jewelry
Gonna be a hoop phenomenon
He's gonna be Hakeem Olajuwan
He's got a gold Camaro
He said over the payphone
I try to keep my cool but
My life turns in slow motion
Bye bye baby blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush it's killing you
Screaming at the sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run
I settle for a ghost I never knew
Super paradise I held on to
But I settle for a ghost
When I was from n.o.l.a no one
Left to be a rock and roll star
He'd stay and treat his lady
Give everything to his new baby
I miss him don't you blame me
That boy went stone cold crazy
Caught up in camera lust he's
Chasing that pappy pipe dreams
I know you don't but I
I know you don't but I still try
My thunder came and shook him down
That girl is gone but I still try
The bullet hit but maybe not
It hits my head and I feel numb
My body's looking wrong
Bye bye baby blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush it's killing you
Screaming at the sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run

Please don't have somebody waiting on you
 This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
 This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

und legst die Deine in meine.
Du flüsterst Sätze mit Bedacht durch all den Lärm 
als ob sie mein Sextant und Kompass wär’n.
Applaus, Applaus
Für Deine Worte. 
Mein Herz geht auf, 
Wenn Du lachst! 
Applaus, Applaus, 
Für Deine Art mich zu begeistern.
Hör niemals damit auf!
Ich wünsch mir so sehr, 
Du hörst niemals damit auf.
Ist meine Erde eine Scheibe, machst Du sie wieder rund.
Zeigst mir auf leise Art und Weise, was Weitsicht heißt.
Will ich mal wieder mit dem Kopf durch die Wand 
Legst Du mir Helm und Hammer in die Hand.
Applaus, Applaus
Für Deine Worte.
Mein Herz geht auf, 
Wenn Du lachst!

Your heart is a square
I love to see you
Way over there
Once I was happy
I found it intriguing
Then you got to me
Left me bleeding
You make me feel like a fool
Waiting for you
I thought we could eat bread
I thought we could talk
On darker days
With our boots kicked off
You looked to me
And I looked away
Though I had been looking
You make me feel like a fool
Waiting for you
You make me feel like a fool
Waiting for you
You make me feel like a fool
Waiting for you

  Meet me in the hallway
  I just left the bedroom, Give me some morphine
  Is there any more to do?
  Just let me know I'll be at the door, at the door
  Hoping you'll come around
Just let me know I'll be on the floor, on the floor
Maybe we'll wooork it out
I gotta get better,   gotta get better
I gotta get better,       gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
 And maybe we'll work it out
  I walked the streets all day
  Running with the thieves
  Cause you left me in the hallway (Give me some more)
  Just take the pain away
  Just let me know I'll be at the door, at the door
  Hoping you'll come around
Just let me know I'll be on the floor, on the floor
Maybe we'll wooork it out
I gotta get better,   gotta get better
I gotta get better,       gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
 And maybe we'll work it out
  We don't talk about it
  It's something we don't do
  Cause once you go without it
  Nothing else will do

Look how they shine for you
And everything you do,
I came along,
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do,
So then I took my turn,
Oh what a thing to have done,
And it was all yellow.
Your skin,
Oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful,
You know, you know I love you so,
I swam across,
I jumped across for you,
Oh, what a thing to do
I drew a line,
I drew a line for you,
Oh, what a thing to do
And it was all yellow.
Your skin,
Oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful,
And you know,
For you I bleed myself dry,
It's true, look how they shine for you, 
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for,
Look how they shine for you,
Look how they shine for you,
Look how they shine.
Look at the stars,
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do.

1,Im Yours (ver 11),Jason Mraz,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jason-mraz/im-yours-chords-373896,"Well you done done me in; you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
And now I'm tryin' to get back
Before the cool done run out, I'll be givin it my bestest
and nothin's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some
But I won't hesitate
No more, no more
It cannot wait; I'm yours
Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family
And it's our god-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved
So I won't hesitate
No more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate,
I'm yours
Doo do do doo doo do, doo do doo do doo do
Do you want to come on, scooch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue
But I won't hesitate
No more, no more
It cannot wait; I'm yours
Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
So please don't, please don't, please don't
There's no need to complicate
'Cause our time is short
This oh, this oh, this is our fate
I'm yours

2,Viva La Vida,Coldplay,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/coldplay/viva-la-vida-chords-675427,"I used to rule the world 
Seas would rise when I gave the word 
Now in the morning I sleep alone 
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice 
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes 
Listen as the crowd would sing: 
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""
One minute I held the key 
Next the walls were closed on me 
And I discovered that my castles stand 
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand 
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing 
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing 
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield 
My missionaries in a foreign field 
For some reason I can't explain 
Once you go there was never, never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world 
It was the wicked and wild wind 
Blew down the doors to let me in. 
Shattered windows and the sound of drums 
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait 
For my head on a silver plate 
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king? 
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing 
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing 
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield 
My missionaries in a foreign field 
For some reason I can't explain 
I know Saint Peter won't call my name ,
never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

I’m a thousand miles away, But girl tonight you look so pretty, 
Yes you do, Time Square can’t shine as bright as you, 
I swear it’s true. 
Hey there Delilah, Don’t you worry about the distance, 
I’m right there if you get lonely, Give this song another listen, 
Close your eyes, Listen to my voice it’s my disguise, 
I’m by your side. 
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
What you do to me. 
Hey there Delilah, I know times are getting hard, 
But just believe me girl some day, I'll pay the bills with this guitar, 
We'll have it good, We'll have the life we knew we would, 
My word is good. 
Hey there Delilah, I’ve got so much left to say, 
If every simple song I wrote to you, Would take your breath away,
I’d write it all, Even more in love with me you’d fall, 
We’d have it all. 
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
A thousand miles seems pretty far, But they’ve got planes and trains and cars, 
I’d walk to you if I had no other way 
Our friends would all make fun of us, And we'll just laugh along because, 
We know that none of them have felt this way, 
Delilah I can promise you, That by the time that we get through, 
The world will never ever be the same, And you’re to blame. 
Hey there Delilah you be good, And don’t you miss me, 
Two more years and you’ll be done with school, And I'll be making history, 
Like I do, You’ll know it's all because of you, 
We can do whatever we want to, 
Hey there Delilah here's to you, This one’s for you. 
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
What you do to me.

When you love someone but it goes to waste,

He broke his own heart and I watched as he tried to re-assemble it

And that was the day that I promised I'd never sing of love
if it does not exist, but darling
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul that love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone or keep a straight face
And I've always lived like this, keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I had sworn to myself that I'm content with loneliness

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

someday you will die,
but I'll be close behind;
I'll follow you into the dark.
No blinding light
or tunnels to gates of white,
just our hands clasped so tight
waiting for the hint of a spark. 
If heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied,
illuminate the ""no""s on their vacancy signs.
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
then I'll follow you into the dark.
In Catholic school,
as vicious as Roman rule,
I got my knuckles bruised 
by a lady in black.
And I held my tongue 
as she told me ""Son, 
fear is the heart of love"".
So I never went back.

illuminate the ""no""s on their vacancy signs.
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
then I'll follow you into the dark.
You and me
have seen everything to see
from Bangkok to Calgary, 
and the soles of your shoes
are all worn down.
The time for sleep is now
but it's nothing to cry about  
'cause we'll hold each other soon
in the blackest of rooms.
If heaven and hell decide that they both are satisfied,
illuminate the ""no""s on their vacancy signs.
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

Tell me, did you fall from a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself

Now I'm trying to get back.
Before the cool done run out, I'll be giving it my bestest,
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention.
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some.
But I won't hesitate no more, no more.

Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love.
Listen to the music of the moment; people dance and sing.
We're just one big family.
And it's our god forsaken right to be loved,
Loved, loved, loved, loved.
So I won't hesitate no more, no more.
It cannot wait, I'm sure.
There's no need to complicate.
Our time is short.
This is our fate, I'm yours.
Tuch-tu...      don't you want to come on
Skooch on over closer, dear,
And I will nibble your ear.
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer.
But my breath fogged up the glass,
And so I drew a new face and I laughed.
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons.
It's what we aim to do.
Our name is our virtue.
But I won't hesitate no more, no more.
It cannot wait, I'm yours.
Open up your mind and see like me.
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free.
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours.

   Nothing's ever built to last
You're in ruins.

   Did you stand too close to the fire?
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone

   And you can't get another try

I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don't go, and I said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me I was
Begging you please don't go, and I said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say yes
Romeo, save me, they try to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real,
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say yes, oh
I got tired of waiting,   wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said
Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head, I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
Marry me, Juliet you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say yes

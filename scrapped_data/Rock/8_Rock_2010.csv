   We small talk,    work and the weather 
   Your guard is up and I know why 
Cause the last time    you saw me 
Is still burned in the back of your mind 
You gave me roses and I left them there to die 
So this is me swallowing my pride, standing in front of you 
Saying I'm sorry for that night 
And I go back to December all the time

Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were  mine                                                
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright 
I go back to December all the time 
  These days I haven't been sleeping 
Staying up, playing back myself leaving 
  When your birthday passed and I didn't call 
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times 
I watched you laughing from the passenger side 
And    realized I loved you in the fall
    And when the cold came,   the dark days 
When fear crept into my mind 
You gave me all your love 
and all I gave you was   goodbye 
So this is me swallowing my pride, standing in front of you 
Saying I'm sorry for that night 
And I go back to December all the time 
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you 
Wishing that I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind 
I go back to December all the time 
I miss your tan skin and your sweet smile
So good to me, so right 
And how you held me in your arms that September night 
The first time you ever saw me cry 
Maybe this is wishful thinking
   Probably mindless dreaming 
  But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door,  I understand 
But this is me swallowing my pride, standing in front of you 
Saying I'm sorry for that night 
And I go back to December   --> comp in

I died a little bit inside
I lay in tears in bed all night
Alone without you by my side
But if you loved me
Why'd ya leave me
Take my body
Take my body

To find somebody

You took my soul and wiped it clean

Says ""Boy quit foolin' around""
I told her ""I love the view from up here
The warm sun and wind in my ear
We'll watch the world from above
As it turns to the rhythm of love""
We may only have tonight
But till the morning sun you're mine , all mine
Play the Music low and sway to the rhythm of love
My heart beats like a drum
A guitar string to the strum
A beautiful song to be sung
She's got, blue eyes deep like the sea
That roll back when she's laughing at me
She rises up like the tide
The moment her lips meet mine
We may only have tonight
But till the morning sun you're mine , all mine
Play the Music low and sway to the rhythm of love
When the moon is low
We can dance in slow motion
And all your tears will subside
All your tears.......will dry
Bah-bah-(ba-ba) bah bah – Bah-bah-(ba-ba)- Bah bah
Daaah – dada,  dum - da da, Dum
Bah-bah-(ba-ba) bah bah – Bah-bah-(ba-ba)- Bah bah
Daaah – dada,  dum - da da, Dum
And long after I've gone
You'll still be humming along
And I will keep you in my mind
The way you make love so fine

Shifting eyes and vacancy

Like passing notes in secrecy

Let me kick it like it's 1986 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
Got another mouth to feed
Leave her with a baby sitter, mama call the grave digger
Gone with the fallen leaves
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
I been feeling it since 1966 now
Mighta had your fill, but you feel it still
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks now
Let me kick it like it's 1986 now
Might be over now, but I feel it still
We could fight a war for peace
Give in to that easy living
Goodbye to my hopes and dreams
Stop flipping for my enemies
We could wave until the walls come down (I'm a rebel just for kicks now)
It's time to give a little tip
Kids in the middle, move over till it falls
Don't bother me
Is it coming
Is it coming
Is it coming
Is it coming
Is it coming back?
Ooh woo, I'm a rebel just for kicks, yeah
Your love is an abyss for my heart to eclipse now
Might be over now, but I feel it still

I been feeling it since 1966 now

And your face stays the same
You're ashamed to say you feel relieved
Stay away from your own family
But years from now
If you could make them proud
You could leave the world and feel like you've achieved the things you hoped to do but
Honestly I don't feel ordinary cause I haven't been at home in a while
Tell them that it's only temporary
I'm trying my best to smile
But that's never enough
Cause when you lose the ones you love
You might find it hard to cry
Until it's only you and everybody else has left the room
You might feel what it's like to not know how to feel
You see, my old lady's old man just now left
And there's nothing i can say except this long awaited rest
Is a good thing and all good things must come to an end
It's right in front of me so there's no reason to pretend Except I'm afraid to die
If this were a movie, you'd be taking our kids to school
And I'd be Channing Tatum or somebody sexy
Somebody cool

Sie hat mir so gefallen, 'drum gab ich ihr 'nen Kuss!
Doch es blieb nicht bei dem einen, das fiel mir gar nicht ein
Rote Lippen soll man küssen, denn zum küssen sind sie da.
Rote Lippen sind dem siebten Himmel ja so nah'!
Ich habe dich gesehen und ich hab' mir gedacht:
Heut ist das schöne Fräulein schon lange meine Braut
und wenn die Eltern es erlauben werden wir getraut.
Jeden Abend will sie wissen, ob das auch so bleibt bei mir,
Rote Lippen soll man küssen, denn zum küssen sind sie da.
Rote Lippen sind dem siebten Himmel ja so nah'!
Ich habe dich gesehen und ich hab' mir gedacht:
Rote Lippen soll man küssen, denn zum küssen sind sie da.
Rote Lippen sind dem siebten Himmel ja so nah'!
Ich habe dich gesehen und ich hab' mir gedacht:
So rote Lippen soll man küssen, Tag und Naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacht

1,The Saga Begins (ver 2),"""Weird Al"" Yankovic",https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/weird-al-yankovic/the-saga-begins-chords-88301,"A long, long time ago, in a galaxy far away, Naboo was under an attack. And I thought
me and Qui-Gon Jin, could talk the Federation into maybe cutting them a little slack. But
their response it didn't thrill us, they locked the doors and tried to kill us. We escaped
from that gas, and met Jar Jar and Boss Nass, we took a Bongo from the scene and we went
to Theed to see the Queen, we all wound up on Tatooine, that's where, we found.. This
Boy'
Oh my, my this here Anakin guy, maybe Vader Someday later now he's just a small fry.
He left his home kissed his mommy goodbye sayin' soon I'm gonna be a Jedi'. Soon
I'm gonna be a Jedi'
Did you know this Junkyard slave isn't even old enough to shave, but he can use the
force they say' ahh do you see him hitting on the queen though he's just nine and she's
fourteen, yeah he's probably gonna marry her someday. Well I know he built C-3PO and
I've heard how fast his Pod can go, and we were broke it's true, so we made a wager or
two Ooo he was a prepubescent flying ace and the minute Jabba started off that race I
knew who would win first place, oh yes, it was, our boy,       we started singing'..
Oh my, my this here Anakin guy, maybe Vader Someday later now he's just a small fry.
He left his home kissed his mommy goodbye sayin' soon I'm gonna be a Jedi'. Soon
I'm gonna be a Jedi'
Now we finally got to Coruscant the Jedi Council we knew would want to see how good
the boy could be, so we took him there and we told a tale how his midichlorians were off
the scale and he might fulfil that Prophesy, well the council was impressed of course,
could he bring balance too the force, they interviewed the kid, oh training they forbid,
because Yoda sensed in him much fear, and Qui-Gon said now listen here, just stick it in
your pointy ear, I still will teach, this boy.
Oh my, my this here Anakin guy, maybe Vader Someday later now he's just a small fry.
He left his home kissed his mommy goodbye sayin' soon I'm gonna be a Jedi. Soon
I'm gonna be a Jedi
We caught a ride back to Naboo, cause Queen Amidala wanted to, I frankly would have
liked to stay, we all fought in that epic war, and it wasn't long at all before little hot shot
flew his plane and saved the day, and in the end some Gungans died, some ships blew
up and some pilots fried, a lot of folks were croakin', the battle droids were broken, and
the Jedi I admire most, met up with Darth Maul and now he's toast, well I'm still here
and he's a ghost, I guess, I'll train, this boy.
Oh my, my this here Anakin guy, maybe Vader Someday later now he's just a small fry.

Oh I'm banging on my Tv set       and I check the odds again,   and I place my bet
I pour a drink and          
I pull the blinds - I wonder what I'll find
I'm leaving Las Vegas,                   the lights so bright
Palm sweat blackjack on a Saturday night
Leaving Las Vegas
Leaving for good,               for good
I'm leaving for good
I'm leaving for good
For good
Waiting for my ship to come in
  But now no joker, no jack, no king
  Can take this losing hand          and make it win

take the so-called right track
faded white hats grabbing credits, maybe transfers
they read all the books but they can't find the answers

I wonder if they've wished for anything better
while in their memories, tiny tragedies
They love to tell you stay inside the lines

I'm gonna bust down the double doors

Nobody ever told her it's the wrong way.
Don't be afraid, at the quickness you get laid.
For your family gets paid. It's the wrong way.
I gave her all that I had to give.
I'm gonna make it hard to live.
Big salty tears running down her chin,
and it ruins up her make up I never wanted.
A cigarette pressed between her lips,
but I'm staring at her tits, it's the wrong way.
strong if i can but i am only a man
so i take her to the can its the wrong way
The only family that she's ever had.
Was her seven horny brothers and her drunk-ass Dad.
He needed money so he put her on the street.
Everything was going fine till the day she met me.
Happy are you sad? Wanna shoot your Dad.
I'll do anything I can. It's the wrong way.
We talked all night, try to make it right.
Believe me shit was tight, It's the wrong way.
So run away if don't wanna stay.
But I ain't here to make you. (Oh no!)
It's up to you what you really wanna do.
Spend some time in America dub style
(jahjahjahjahjahpickitupchichchchichchhohhohheaheahheah)
She'll give you all that she's got to give.
I'm gonna make it hard to live.
Big salty tears running down her chin,
and it ruins all her make up I never wanted.
So we ran away, and I'm sorry when I say,
that to this very day it was the wrong way.
She took a hike, it don't matter if I like it or not.
Cuz' she only wants the wrong way.
I give her all that I had to give.
She still wouldn't take it. (Oh no!)
Her two brown eyes are leaking like a sieve.
But it still ruins her make up and everyone gives.

I know I'll never really get inside of you
to make your eyes catch fire
the way the blue could pull me in
if they only would
at least I'd lose this sense of sensing something else
from me and you
with aching looks and breaking hearts
and all the prayers your hands can make
oh I just take as much as you can throw
and then I throw it all away
oh I throw it all away
like throwing faces at the sky
like throwing arms around
yesterday
wide-eyed in front of you
and the face I saw looked back
the way I wanted to
but I just can't hold my tears away
the way you do
Elise believe I never wanted this
I thought this time I'd keep all of my promises
I thought you were the girl always dreamed about
but I let the dream go
and the promises broke
and the make-believe ran out...

And we both know hearts can change
    And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain

Just tryin' to kill the pain,   oh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go 
An' no one's really sure who's lettin' go today    Walking away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line 
I could rest my head just knowin' that you were mine    All mine
   So if you want to love me then darlin' don't refrain
   Or I'll just end up walkin' in the cold November rain
Do you need some time...on your own
Do you need some time...all alone
ooh, everybody needs some time...on their own
ooh, don't you know you need some time...all alone
   I know it's hard to keep an open heart
   When even friends seem out to harm you
   But if you could heal a broken heart
   Wouldn't time be out to charm you
Sometimes I need some time...on my own
Sometimes I need some time...all alone
ooh, everybody needs some time...on their own
ooh, don't you know you need some time...all alone

At this old piano
Trying hard to capture
The moment this morning I don't know
Cause a bottle of Vodka
Is still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies
They won't make of me when I'm dead
With an ironclad fist I wake up and
French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps
While we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and
And the truth is baby you're all that I need...
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses
Well I'm so far away
That each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night
Just to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time
Or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
Baby blind love is true
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses
The hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died
Now as you close your eyes
Know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight I won't be alone
Mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove
For it's you that I'd die to defend
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails

You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older

Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim

Got into an accident and couldn't come to school
But when he finally came back
His hair had turned from black into bright white
He said that it was from when
Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm, Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm
Once   there was this girl who
Wouldn't go to change with the girls in the change room
But when   they finally made her
They saw    birthmarks all over her body
She couldn't quite explain it

Once   there was this girl who
Wouldn't go to change with the girls in the change room
But when   they finally made her
They saw    birthmarks all over her body
She couldn't quite explain it
Both girl and boy were glad
One kid had it worse than that
'Cause then   there was a boy whose
Parents made him come right home directly after school
And when they went to their church
They shook   and lurched all over the church floor
He couldn't quite explain it

See our friends, see the sights, feel alright
We wake up, we go out, smoke a fag, put it out
See our friends, see the sights, feel alright
Are we like you, I can't be sure
Of the scene as she turns we are strange in our hearts
But we are young, we get by, can't go mad, ain't got time
Sleep around if we like but we're alright
Got some cash, bought some wheels, took it out, 'cross the fields
Lost control, hit a wall but we're alright
Are we like you, I can't be sure

46,Silent Lucidity,Queensrÿche,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/1699852,"Hush now, don't you cry
Wipe away the teardrop from your eye
You're lying safe in bed
Spinning in your head
Your mind tricked you to feel the pain
Of someone close to you leaving the game of life
So here it is, another chance
Wide awake you face the day
There's a place I like to hide
A doorway that I run through in the night
Relax child, you were there
But only didn't realize and you were scared
It's a place where you will learn
To face your fears, retrace the years
Commanding in another world
Suddenly you hear and see
I- will be watching over you
I- am gonna help you see it through
I- will protect you in the night
I- am smiling next to you, in Silent Lucidity
If you open your mind for me
You won't rely on open eyes to see
The walls you built within
Come tumbling down, and a new world will begin
Living twice at once you learn
You're safe from pain in the dream domain
A round trip journey in your head
Master of illusion, can you realize
I- will be watching over you
I- am gonna help to see it through
I- will protect you in the night
I- am smiling next to you....

Show me what he's done to you
Stand up, little girl
A broken heart can't be that bad
When it's through, it's through
Fate will twist the both of you
So come on baby, come on over
Let me be the one to show you
I'm the one who wants to be with you
Deep inside, I hope you feel it too
Waited on a line of greens and blues
Just to be the next to be with you
Build up your confidence
So you can be on top for once
Wake up, who cares about
Little boys that talk too much
I've seen it all go down
Your game of love was all rained out
So come on baby, come on over
Let me be the one to hold you
I'm the one who wants to be with you
Deep inside, I hope you feel it too
Waited on a line of greens and blues
Just to be the next to be with you
Why be alone
When we can be together, baby
You can make my life worthwhile
I can make you start to smile
When it's through, it's through
Fate will twist the both of you
So come on baby, come on over
Let me be the one to show you
I'm the one who wants to be with you
Deep inside I hope you feel it too
Waited on a line of greens and blues
Just to be the next to be with you

and two miles to the dusty street that I saw you on today,
It's four miles to my lonely room where I'm gonna hide my face,
and about half a mile to the downtown bar that I ran from in disgrace
Lord how long have I got to keep on running?
Seven hours, seven days or seven years?
All I know is since you've been gone, feel like I'm drowning
Drowning in a river of tears
Drowning in a river
Feel like I'm drowning, drowning in a river of tears
In three more days, I leave this town, in disappear without a trace,
a year from now maybe settle down, where no one knows my face,
I wish that I could hold you one more time to ease the pain,
But my times run out and I got to go, got to run away again
Still I catch myself thinking 
one day I'll find my way back here
And you'll save me from drowning,
Drowning in a river of tears
Drowning in a river
Feel like I'm drowning, drowning in a river of tears

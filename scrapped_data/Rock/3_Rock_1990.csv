I didn't mind, it's not my kind.  It's not my time, to wonder why.
Everything's gone white, everything's gray.  Now you're here, now you're away.
Don't want this, remember that. I'll never forget, where you're at.
  Don't let the days go by.
Glycerine        Glycerine
  I'm never alone, I'm alone all the time. Are you at one, do you lie.
We live on a wheel, where everyone steals. And when we rise, it's like strawberry fields.
Treated you bad, you bruise my face. Couldn't love you more, you've got a beautiful taste.
  Don't let the days go by,   Could've been easier on you.
I couldn't change, Though I wanted to.
Should've been easier by three, Our old friend fear, and you and me.

   Bad moon white again,     Bad moon white again.
As she falls around me.
  I needed you more, you wanted us less. Could not kiss, just regress.
It might just be, clear simple and plain. Well that's just fine, that's just one of my names.
  Don't let the days go by,
  Could have been easier on you...you...you

Small town predicts my fate
Perhaps that's what no one wants to see
I just want to scream, ""hello!""

Mapa boogie man o cha-cha.
Ngunit ang paborito,
Ay pagsayaw mo ng el bimbo.
Nakakaindak, nakakaaliw,
Nakakatindig balahibo.
   Pagkagaling sa skwela ay didiretso na sa inyo,
   At buong maghapon ay tinuturuan mo ako.
Magkahawak ang ating kamay,
At walang kamalay-malay.
Na tinuruan mo ang puso ko,
Na umibig ng tunay.
Naninigas ang aking katawan,
Pagumikot na ang plaka.
  Patay sa kembot ng bewang mo,
At ang pungay ng iyong mga mata.
Lumiliwanag ang buhay,
Habang tayo'y magkaakbay.
At dahan-dahang dumudulas, 
Ang kamay ko sa makinis mong braso.
   Sana noon pa man ay sinabi na sa iyo,
   Kahit hindi na uso ay ito lang ang alam ko.
Magkahawak ang ating kamay,
At walang kamalay-malay.

  Balita ko'y may anak ka na,
Ngunit walang asawa.
Tagahugas ka raw ng pinggan 
Sa may Ermita.
At isang gabi nasagasaan,
Sa isang madilim na eskinita.
  Lahat ng pangarap ko'y bigla lang natunaw,
  Sa panaginip na lang pala kita maisasayaw.
Magkahawak ang ating kamay,
At walang kamalay-malay.

It feels like Independence Day
And I can't break away from this parade
But there's got to be an opening
Somewhere here in front of me
Through this maze of ugliness and greed
And I seen the sun up ahead
At the county line bridge
Sayin' all there's good and nothingness is dead
We'll run until she's out of breath
She ran until there's nothin' left

Sometimes I think I'd like to watch it burn
I'm so alone, and I feel just like somebody else
Man, I ain't changed, but I know I ain't the same
But somewhere here in between the city walls of dyin' dreams
I think her death it must be killin' me

Out from the barrio,     you hear my rhythm from your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round     and round
And if you say this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Cause you're so smooth
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well that's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart, make it real
Or else forget about it

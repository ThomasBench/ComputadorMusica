0,Loving My Jesus,Casting Crowns,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/casting-crowns/loving-my-jesus-chords-1896985,"I was a wandering soul 
Travelling a well worn road 
A sinner so far from home 
No second chance in sight 
I heard you call my name 
I felt you lift my shame
And I made a vow that day 
That I’d spend the rest of my life 
Loving my Jesus, Showing my scars 
Telling my story of how mercy 
Can reach you where you are 
 I pray the whole world hears the cry of my heart 
Is to see all the ones I love loving my Jesus 
Sin tries to make you hide
Whispers that same old lie 
Keep all your pain inside
‘Cause no one will understand 
The last thing this lost world needs 
Is someone I’m trying to be 
The truth that has set me free 
Is that I’m just a broken man 
Loving my Jesus, Showing my scars 
Telling my story of how mercy 
Can reach you where you are 
 I pray the whole world hears the cry of my heart 
Is to see all the ones I love loving my Jesus 
When all is said and done
When my last song's been sung
I stand face to face with the One
Who gave all for me
May all I have to show
Be all that mattered most
Making Your great name known
Let this be my only legacy
Loving my Jesus, Showing my scars 
Telling my story of how mercy 
Can reach you where you are 
 I pray the whole world hears the cry of my heart 
Is to see all the ones I love 
 To see all the ones I love loving my Jesus

And everybody was gone 
You were staring down the street 'cause you were tryin' not to crack up
It wasn't like a rain, it was more like a sea
I didn't ask for this pain, it just came over me
I love a storm, but I don't love lightning
All the waters coming up so fast, it's frightening

I was in the fight
I was coming back 
From what seemed like a ruin
I couldn't see 
You coming so far
I just turn around 
And there you are
I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now
I was just getting used to living life without you around
I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now
You always said I held you way too high off the ground
You didn't see me I was falling apart
I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in the park
You didn't see me I was falling apart
I was a television version of a person with a broken heart
You didn't see me I was falling apart
I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in the park
You didn't see me I was falling apart

When you know not what to say
For duty calls your sweetheart's name again
And your heart need not be sighing
If I be among the dying

Beside the river
And the mockingbird has sung his sweet refrain
In the days of Old Lang Syne

Came a whisper soft and low
A soldier who had fallen in the fray
I am dying, I am dying
And I know I'll have to go
But I want to tell you before I pass away
There's a far and distant river
Where the roses are in bloom
A sweetheart who is waiting there for me
And it's there I pray you take me

Would you stick through it?
When things aren't quite as easy as they once were

And you have a tendency to get mad when you're bored
And will you risk your sanity
Plus all the other things you might not end up liking about me
Will you promise to love me more than you might hate me?
So I’ll stay sober
Or at least smoke a little less weed
If you'll live closer       to me so I can still sleep at your house
When it's cold and it's dark outside
I’ve never slept that well in my whole life
And its nice to not have to try sometimes

No ones ever made me feel as loved as you do

There's a house down there but I lost it long ago

Il suo essere contemporaneamente esatta
L'aria di città 
che la rende un po’ più viva ma mi soffoca
Questa luce che scaldava i miei pensieri e mi teneva a bada
Ora è soltanto una decorazione
Strappami la testa dalle nuvole
Poi nascondimi, pregami, buttami
Accendimi, ascoltami, arrenditi
Eliminami, ma ricorda
Che l'aurelia è troppo fredda  quando è sera 
Non si può fare come ti pare
Tra un po’ non avrai più vent'anni e la vita diventa un mestiere
Faccio come lei
Mi trasformo e mi stupisco ad ogni cambiamento
Non importa dov'è il mare e poco mi interessa 
Dove soffia il vento
Poi la sera si alza in piedi e fa quell'espressione che
Pensavo non avrei più visto
Che va bene per innamorarsi oppure per morire
È un sorriso forse un ghigno malinconico Che suggerisce voglia di partire
Strappami la testa dalle nuvole
Poi nascondimi, pregami, buttami
Accendimi, ascoltami, arrenditi

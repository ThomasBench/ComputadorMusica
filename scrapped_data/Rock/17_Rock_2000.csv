to lay next to you
I would dig a thousand more
if I needed to
I look around the grave
for an escape route of old routines
There doesn't seem to be any other way
Cause I've started falling apart
I'm not savoring life
I've forgotten how good it could be
to feel alive
Crazy as it sounds, you won't
feel as low as you feel right now
At least that's what I've been
told by everyone
I whisper empty sounds in your ear
and hope that you won't let go
Take the pieces and build them skywards
Cause I've started falling apart
I'm not savoring life
I've forgotten how good it could be
to feel alive
I've started falling apart
I'm not savoring life
I've forgotten how good it could be
to feel alive
I've started falling apart
I'm not savoring life
I've forgotten how good it could be

4,The Mariners Revenge Song,The Decemberists,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-decemberists/the-mariners-revenge-song-chords-1229787,"We are two mariners, our ships' sole survivors
In this belly of a whale
I guess we have some time to kill
And you a lad of eighteen
How our histories interweave
At the time you were a rake and a roustabout
Spending all your money on the whores and hounds, oh
You had a charming air, all cheap and debonair
My widowed mother found so sweet
Now filled with filth and foul disease
As time wore on you proved a debt-ridden drunken mess
Leaving my mother a poor consumptive wretch, oh
And then you dissapeared, your gambling arrears
The only thing you left behind
And my poor mother lost her mind
Then one day in spring my dear sweet mother died
But before she did I took her hand as she dying cried, oh
""Find him, bind him
Fingers to splinters
Wakes up naked
Clawing at the ceiling of his grave""
It took me fifteen years to swallow all my tears
Among the urchins in the street
To keep their vestry nice and neat
But never once in the employ of these holy men
Did I ever once stir my mind from the thought of revenge, oh
One night I overheard the prior exhanging words
With a penitent whaler from the sea
Was known for wanton cruelty
The following day I shipped to sea with a privateer
And in the whistle of the wind I could almost hear, oh
""Find him, bind him
Fingers to splinters
Wakes up naked
Clawing at the ceiling of his grave
There is one thing I must say to you
As you sail across the sea
Always your mother will watch over you
As you avenge this wicked deed""
And then that fateful night we had you in our sight
After twenty months at sea
when came this rumbling from beneath
The ocean stirred the sky went black and the captain quailed
And before us grew the angry jaws of a giant whale, oh
Don't know how I survived, the crew all was chewed alive
I must have slipped between his teeth
That you should survive as well as me
It gives my heart great joy to see your eyes fill with fear
So lean in close and I will whisper the last words you'll hear, oh

Staring at a television screen
They've sped up to the point where they provoke
You to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke

And it's the thousandth time and it's even bolder,
 Don't be surprised when you get bent over
  They told ya, that you were gagging for it
She saw it and she grabbed it and it wasn't what it seemed
The kids all dream of making it, whatever that means
Another variation on a theme
A tangle on the television and the magazine
D'you reckon that they do it for a joke?
D'you reckon that they make 'em take an oath?
That says ""we are defenders
Of any poser or professional pretender around""

Like a fist replaced a kiss?

Everything-cause tried and true, I see the light in you
Can you dig in my soul, could you smell my whole-life?
You bent the edge, eclipsed and turned around, aligning
And through the dark sparked rays of violet light, blinding
I went about the job of sowing thoughts and feelings
Some were good, some bad, I felt the cries of healing
Cause tried and true, I see the light in you
Can you dig in my soul, could you smell my whole-life?
Rise my Dawn, you've been awake too long
Let me rest in time while I blow your mind
At the dawn I woke, I was alone, rising
I called upon the force of time and space, calling
And as she came to me I fell back down, realizing
That it's cool for you to love me now, I'm everything
Cause tried and true, I see the light in you
Can you dig in my soul, could you smell my whole-life?

Black leather boots
Spit-shined so bright 
They cut off my hair but it looked alright
We marched and we sang
We all became friends
As we learned how to fight
A hero of war
Yeah that’s what I’ll be
And when I come home
They’ll be damn proud of me
I’ll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
Because it’s flag that I love
And a flag that I trust
I kicked in the door
I yelled my commands
The children, they cried
But I got my man
We took him away
A bag over his face
From his family and his friends
They took off his clothes
They pissed in his hands
I told them to stop
But then I joined in
We beat him with guns
And batons not just once
But again and again
A hero of war
Yeah that’s what I’ll be
And when I come home
They’ll be damn proud of me
I’ll carry this flag
To the grave if I must
Because it’s flag that I love

She walked through bullets and haze
I asked her to stop
I begged her to stay
But she pressed on
So I lifted my gun
And I fired away
The shells jumped through the smoke
And into the sand
That the blood now had soaked
She collapsed with a flag in her hand
A flag white as snow
A hero of war 
Is that what they see
Just medals and scars
So damn proud of me
And I brought home that flag
Now it gathers dust
But it’s a flag that I love
It’s the only flag I trust

Looking like another Bob Marley day
Hitting from the bong like a diesel train
And I'm down with hanging out this afternoon 
We got weeds in the back yard 4 feet tall 
Cheech and Chong probably would have smoked them all 
So I'm out, on the couch this afternoon 
Beer bottles laying on the kitchen floor
If we take 'em all back we can buy some more 
So I doubt we'll go without this afternoon     Oh!
Better hang on if you're tagging along 
Cause we'll be doing this till 6 in the morning 
Nothing wrong with going all night long 
Tough to put the brakes on doesn't matter when you got to 
Get up, go out
Me and all my friends 
We'll drink up, fall down 
Then we'll do it all again 
Just sitting around, hanging out this afternoon 
The landlord says I should buy a tent
But he can kiss my ass cause I paid my rent 
So I doubt, he'll kick me out this afternoon 
Down on the corner in a seedy bar
Jukebox cranking out the CCR
Had a few, to Suzy Q, this afternoon 
Better hang on if you're tagging along 
Cause we'll be doing this till 6 in the morning 
Nothing wrong with going all night long 
Tough to put the brakes on doesn't matter when you got to

Then we'll do it all again 
yeah...
Just sitting around, hanging out this afternoon 
Don't want a wristwatch, or alarm clock to see what time it is
From the moment I wake up, I just love being with my friends
We barely get by, but have the best times and hope it never ends
We drink all day until we fall down, so we can do it all again 
So I doubt I'll figure out just what to do 
'Bout to kicking around hanging out this afternoon 
Better hang on if you're tagging along 
Cause we'll be doing this till 6 in the morning 
Nothing wrong with going all night long 
Tough to put the brakes on doesn't matter when you got to

Forgotten freedom burns
Has the Shephard led his lambs astray

Turn a darker shade of red
And the bullet with this sniper lie
In their bloody gutless cell
Must we starve on crumbs from long ago

Is it a great or little thing we fought
Knelt the conscience blessed to kill
Must it take a life for hateful eyes

Or maybe it`s the way we fought

For each kiss is a cry we all lost
Though nothing left to gain
But for the banshee that stole the grave
Cause we find ourselves in the same old mess

I sit in and dwell on faces past
Like memories seem to fade
No color left but black and white
And soon will all turn grey
But may these shadows rise to walk again
With lessons truly learnt
When the blossom flowers in each our hearts
Shall beat a new found flame (the flame!)

at long last it's crashed, its colossal mass
has broken up into bits in my moat
lift the mattress off the floor
walk the cramps off
go meander in the cold
hail to your dark skin
hiding the fact you're dead again
underneath the power lines seeking shade
far above our heads are the icy heights that contain all reason
it's a luscious mix of words and tricks
that let us bet when you know we should fold
on rocks I dreamt of where we'd stepped
and of the whole mess of roads we're now on
hold your glass up, hold it in
never betray the way you've always known it is
one day I'll be wondering how
I got so old just wondering how
I never got cold wearing nothing in the snow
this is way beyond my remote concern
all these squawking birds won't quit
building nothing, laying bricks

We realise the difference is none.
It's underdogs who, and if you want it,
You always have to make your own fun.

The local cultures are dying and dying.
The programmed robots are buying and buying,
Secluded freaks they are still trying trying.

Ooohooooh, through the roof, underground.
And as the boy scouts learn to read between the lines,
The silver rabbits hop between their fathers' lies.
And boy scouts ask, ""Where? Where do they go?""
They go to the country that they only know.
Just like their meanings they lay between the lines,
Between the borders their real countries hide,
Their strategies, they advertise,
Their strategy of being is one of in-your-face disguise.
Ooohooooh, through the roof, underground.
Ooohooooh, through the roof, underground.
And when their own walls they will a-crumble,
And all the systems will be discumbumbled,

And watch it unwind

Johnny I hardly knew ya
We had guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo hurroo
We had guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo hurroo
We had guns and drums and drums and guns
The enemy never slew ya
Johnny I hardly knew ya

45,Zanim Pójdę,Happysad,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/1905964,"Ile jestem ci winien?
Ile policzyłaś mi za swą przyjaźń?
Ale kiedy wszystko już oddam, czy
będziesz szczęśliwa i wolna czy...
będziesz szczęśliwa i wolna czy...
Ale zanim pójdę,    ale zanim pójdę,
ale zanim pójdę chciałbym powiedzieć ci, że:
Miłość to nie pluszowy miś ani kwiaty.
To też nie diabeł rogaty.
Ani miłość kiedy jedno płacze
a drugie po nim skacze.
Miłość to żaden film w żadnym kinie
ani róże ani całusy małe, duże.
Ale miłość - kiedy jedno spada w dół,
drugie ciągnie je ku górze.

Ile były warte nasze słowa,
kiedy próbowaliśmy wszystko od nowa?

Without a care in the world.
And I'm sitting here wearing the weight of the world on my shoulders.
It's been a long day and there's still work to do,
She's pulling at me saying ""Dad I need you!
There's a ball at the castle and I've been invited 
And I need to practice my dancin'""
""Oh please, daddy, please!""
So I will dance with Cinderella
While she is here in my arms
'Cause I know something the prince never knew
Oh I will dance with Cinderella
I don't want to miss even one song
'Cause all too soon the clock will strike midnight
And she'll be gone.
She says he's a nice guy and I'd be impressed
She wants to know if I approve of the dress
She says, ""Dad the prom is just one week away
And I need to practice my dancin'""
""Oh please, daddy, please!""
So I will dance with Cinderella
While she is here in my arms
'Cause I know something the prince never knew
Oh I will dance with Cinderella
I don't want to miss even one song
'Cause all too soon the clock will strike midnight
And she'll be gone.
She will be gone.
Well, she came home today with a ring on her hand  
Just glowin' and tellin' us all they had planned
She says, ""Dad the wedding's still six months away 
But I need to practice my dancin'""
""Oh please, daddy, please!""
So I will dance with Cinderella
While she is here in my arms
'Cause I know something the prince never knew
Oh I will dance with Cinderella
I don't want to miss even one song
'Cause all too soon the clock will strike midnight
And she'll be gone.

A breeze from a distance
Is calling your name
Unfurl your black wings and wait
Across the horizons coming
to sweep you away
It's coming to sweep you away
Let the wind carry you home
Blackbird fly away
May you never be broken again
The fragile can not endure
The wrecked and the and
jaded a place so impure
The static of this cruel world
Cause some birds to fly long
before they've seen their day
long before they've seen their day
Let the wind carry you home
Blackbird fly away
May you never be broken again
Beyond the suffering you’ve known
I hope you find your way
May you never be broken again
Ascend may you find no resistance
Know that you've made
All you leave behind will
live to the end
The cycle of suffering goes
on But the memories
Someday I too will fly
and find you again
Let the wind carry you home
Blackbird fly away
May you never be broken again
Beyond the suffering you’ve known
I hope you find your way
May you never be broken again
May you never be broken again

His way or no way, totalatarian
He's got no time for you
How he don't want you to
So step out the queue
He makes examples of you
 Behind they go through to the bit where you pay
And you realise then that it's finally the time
To walk back past ten thousand eyes in the line
And you can swap jumpers and make another move
Instilled in your brain you've got something to prove
To all the smirking faces and the boys in black
Why can't they be pleasant?
Why can't they have a laugh?
He's got his hand in your chest
Well secrectly I think they want it all to kick off
They want, arms flying everywhere and
Something to talk about
A story to tell you
     Well I'm so glad they turned us all away we'll put it down to fate
     I thought a thousand million things that I could never say this morning
      Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?
This town's a different town today
 This town's a different town to what it was last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday..
That girl's a different girl today
  Said that girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday    Of course no.
    Well I'm so glad they turned us all away we'll put it down to fate
    I thought a thousand million things that I could never think this morning
     Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

It made so much sense 
But now the haze has ascended
It don't make no sense anymore

Making all his nowhere plans for nobody.
Doesn't have a point of view, knows not where he's
going to.
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere man, please listen.
You don't know what you're missing.
Nowhere man, the world is at your command.
He's as blind as he can be, just sees what he
wants to see.
Nowhere man, can you see me, at all?
Doesn't have a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to, isn't he a bit
like you and me?
Nowhere man, don't worry.
Take your time, don't hurry.
Leave it all, till somebody else
lends you a hand.
He's a real nowhere man,
Sitting in his nowhere land,
Making all his nowhere plans
For nobody. (last line x2)

   He dug it.

The one that shut the kitchen door? 
He don’t give a hoot of a warning, 
A-wrapped up in a black cat coat

He’s split the time the cock’rel crows
Talking about the midnight gambler, 
The one you’ve never seen before
A-talking about the midnight gambler
Did you see him jump the garden wall?
A-sighing down the wind so sadly
A-listen and you hear him moan
Well I’m talking about the midnight gambler
Everybody got to go
Did you hear about the midnight rambler?
Well honey it’s no rock’n’roll show
Well I’m a-talking about the midnight gambler
The one you’ve never seen before
Don’t you do that (repeat over the riff many times then slow)
Well you heard about the Boston... 
It’s not, one those...
Well I’m talking about the midnight... 
The one who closed the bedroom door?
I’m called the hit and run, rape her in anger
The knife sharpened tippy toed
Or just the shoot him dead brain-belled jangler
You know the one you never seen before
So if you ever meet the midnight rambler
A-crawling down your marble hall
Well he prowling like a proud black panther
You can say I, I told you so
Well won’t you listen for the midnight rambler
Play it easy as you go
I’m gonna smash down your plate glass windows
Put a fist through your steel plate door
Did you hear about the midnight rambler? 
He’ll leave his footprints up and down your hall
A-did you hear about the midnight gambler? 
A-did you see me make my midnight call?
And if you ever catch the midnight rambler
I’ll steal your mistress from under your nose
Well go easy with your cold fandango
I’ll stick my knife right down your throat, baby and it hurts

Anche lui nato per caso in via Gluck
In una casa, fuori città
Gente tranquilla che lavorava
Là dove c'era l'erba, ora c'è una città
E quella casa in mezzo al verde
Ormai dove sarà?
Questo ragazzo della via Gluck
Si divertiva a giocare con me
Ma un giorno disse: Vado in città
E lo diceva mentre piangeva
Io gli domando: Amico, non sei contento?
Vai finalmente a stare in città
Là troverai le cose che non hai avuto qui
Potrai lavarti in casa
Senza andar giù nel cortile
Mio caro amico disse: Qui sono nato
In questa strada ora lascio il mio cuore
Ma come fai a non capire
È una fortuna, per voi che restate
A piedi nudi a giocare nei prati
Mentre là in centro respiro il cemento
Ma verrà un giorno che ritornerò ancora qui
E sentirò l'amico treno
Che fischia così, wa wa?!
Passano gli anni, ma otto son lunghi
Però quel ragazzo ne ha fatta di strada
Ma non si scorda la sua prima casa
Ora coi soldi lui può comperarla
Torna e non trova gli amici che aveva
Solo case su case, catrame e cemento
Là dove c'era l'erba ora c'è una città
E quella casa in mezzo al verde
Ormai dove sarà?
Eh, Non so, non so
Perché continuano a costruire le case
E non lasciano l'erba, non lasciano l'erba
Non lasciano l'erba, non lasciano l'erba
Eh, no, se andiamo avanti così
Chissà, come si farà, chissà...

Well he may and he may decline.

Stephen would answer if he only knew how.
Wishing well with a golden bell,
Bucket hanging clear to hell,
Hell halfway twixt now and then,
Stephen fill it up and lower down and lower down again.
Lady finger, dipped in moonlight,
Writing ""What for?"" across the morning sky.
Sunlight splatters, dawn with answer,
Darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye.
Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow,
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned.
Several seasons  with their treasons,
Wrap the babe in scarlet colors, call it your own.
Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye,
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills,
One man gathers what another man spills.
Saint Stephen will remain,
All he's lost he shall regain,
Seashore washed by the suds and foam,
Been here so long, he's got to calling it home.
Fortune comes a crawlin', calliope woman,
Spinnin' that curious sense of your own.

like a lizard on a window pane               
The man in the crowd with the multicolored mirrors on his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate and donated to the national trust
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down, down to the bits that I left up town
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down.
Mother Superior jump the gun, Mother Superior jump the gun. 3X

Stop and say hello
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar

In the pouring rain,     very strange

Wet beneath the blue suburban skies

And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen

Full of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back behind the...
shelter in the middle of a roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trend
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain,     very strange

Wet beneath the blue suburban skies

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Wet beneath the blue suburban skies

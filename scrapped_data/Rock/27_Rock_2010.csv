0,I Wanna Get Lost With You (ver 2),Stereophonics,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/stereophonics/i-wanna-get-lost-with-you-chords-1753669,"Do you remember the light of the flame
It was a birthday party of someone
Then you told me your name
Thought you were one in a million
I wanna get lost with you
It's the only thing I wanna do
Get out of my mind with you
so come on over
I walked you home in the rain
Speaking the same language
You were running around in my brain
Then you sent me a message
I wanna get lost with you
It's the only thing I wanna do
Get out of my mind with you
so come on over
I wanna get lost with you
It's the only thing I wanna do
Get out of my mind with you
so come on over
I know we did some wrong
You told me that night when I came to you that you were with someone
It got messed up with so much stuff like living a loaded gun
But now that I'm out of my mind with you, we've got our day in the sun
I wanna get lost with you
It's the only thing I wanna do
Get out of my mind with you
So come on over
I wanna get lost with you
It's the only thing I wanna do
Get out of my mind with you
So come on over
So come on over
So come on over
Come on over
I wanna get lost with you
I wanna get lost with you
Wanna get lost with you
Yeah you
So come on over

1,Father (ver 3),The Front Bottoms,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-front-bottoms/father-chords-1843277,"I have this dream that I am hitting my dad with a baseball bat
And he is screaming and crying for help
And maybe halfway through it has more to do with me killing him
Then it ever did protecting myself
And I believe that yeah, dad, maybe no one is perfect
But I believe that you were pushing your luck
It just sucks it played out like this
A terrible movie and you can tell none of the actors even give a fuck
But you look good tonight girlfriend, Can I sleep in your bed?
And when I crawl out in the morning, Can I stay inside your head?
Cause you were high school
And I was just more like real life
And you were okay, okay as a girlfriend
But I was just more like his wife
I'll do the push-ups, I'll wear the makeup
I'll do whatever he wants all night
Cause you were okay okay as a girlfriend
But I was just more like real life.
A long, long time ago my great, great, great, great grandfather 
took something that did not belong to him
And that is why today I have an eagle in my veins
I am part Native American
And I am leaving as soon as I come.
As soon as I come you will probably forget my name
I hope I fall asleep at the wheel and crash my car (on the ride home)
Or I could just stay here, because
You look good tonight girlfriend, Can I sleep in your bed?
And when I crawl out in the morning, Can I stay inside your head?
Cause you were high school
And I was just more like real life
And you were okay, okay as a girlfriend

I'll wear the makeup, I'll do the push-ups 
I'll do whatever he wants all night

As one reminds the other of the past
A life lived much too fast to hold onto
How am I losing you?
A broken house
Another dry month waiting for the rain
And I had been resisting this decay
I thought you'd do the same
But this is all I ever was
And this is all you came across those years ago
Now you go too far
Don't tell me that I've changed because that's not the truth
And now I'm losing you
Fragile sound
The world outside just watches as we crawl
Crawl towards a life of fragile lines
And wasted time
And so I cry
As I hold you for the last time in this life
This life I tried so hard to give to you
What would you have me do?
But this is all I ever was
And this is all you came across those years ago
Now you go too far
Don't tell me that I've changed because that's not the truth
And now I'm losing you
Where I used to end was where you start
You were the only one
And now I see your eyes move too fast
You were the only one
Careful hands
And wandering without that much to say
Your words are empty as the bed we made
Is there another way?
Oh love, is there another way?
But this is all I ever was
And this is all you came across those years ago
Now you go too far
Don't tell me that I've changed because that's not the truth

They're right, no one's gonna catch us now
Daddy's bought a  new car now

She's mad, at least that's what they say
Mum and daddy aren't in love
That's fine, I'll settle for two birthdays

That's fine, cause nothing's gonna scare us now
We're all in our dressing gowns,
mine's white and stripey, yours is green and brown
I forgot my name again
I think that's something worth remembering
Spiders in your favourite shoes
Just leave them be cause they're more scared of you

 They're lost inside your memory
 You're dragging on, your heart's been broken
As we all go down in history
 Where in the world did the time go?
 It's where your spirit seems to roam
 Like losing faith to our abandon
Or an empty hallway from a broken home
 Well don't look away
From the arms of a bad dream
 Don't look away
Sometimes you're better lost than to be seen
 I don't feel strange, it's more like haunted
 Another moment trapped in time
 I can't quite put my finger on it
But it's like a child that was left behind
 So where in the world's the forgotten?
 Like soldiers from a long lost war
 We share the scars from our abandon
And what we remember becomes folklore
 Well don't look away
From the arms of a bad dream
 Don't look away
Sometimes you're better lost than to be seen
 Well don't look away
From the arms of a moment
 Don't look away
From the arms of tomorrow
 Well don't look away
From the arms of a moment            
From the arms of love
Well don't look away
From the arms of a bad dream
 Don't look away
Sometimes you're better lost than to be seen
 Well don't look away
From the arms of a moment
 Don't look away
From the arms of tomorrow
 Well don't look away

11,The Suburbs Album,Arcade Fire,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/arcade-fire/the-suburbs-chords-972794," In the suburbs I,    I learned to drive
 And you told me we’d never survive,   grab your mother’s keys, we’re leaving
 You always seemed so sure,   That one day we’d be fighting
 In a suburban war,   your part of town against mine
 I saw you standing on the opposite shore,  but by the time the first bombs fell
 We were already bored,   We were already, already bored
 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling
 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling again
 The kids wanna be so hard,    but in my dreams we’re still screaming
 And running through the yard,   when all of the walls that they built in the 
 Seventies finally fall,    And all of the houses they built in the
 Seventies finally fall, meant nothing at all,  meant nothing at all, it meant nothing
 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling
 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling and into the night
 So can you understand,      why I want a daughter while I’m still young
 I want to hold her hand, and show her some beauty
 Before all this damage is done,   but if it’s too much to ask
 If it’s too much to ask,    then send me a son
 Under the overpass,       in the parking lot we’re still waiting
 It’s already passed,      so move your feet from hot pavement
 And into the grass,    cause it’s already past, it’s already, already past
 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling
 Sometimes I can’t believe it, I’m moving past the feeling again
 I’m moving past the feeling again
 I’m moving past the feeling again
 In my dreams we’re still screaming
 We’re still screaming
 We’re still screaming
Businessmen drink my blood
Like the kids in art school said they would
And I guess I'll just begin again
You say can we still be friends
  If I was scared, I would
  And if I was bored, you know I would
  And if I was yours, but I'm not
All the kids have always known
That the emperor wears new clothes
But to bow to down to them anyway
Is better than to be alone
Now you're knocking at my door
Saying please come out against the night
But I would rather be alone
Than pretend I feel alright
If the businessmen drink my blood
Like the kids in art school said they would
Then I guess I'll just begin again
You say can we still be friends
  If I was scared, I would
  And if I was pure, you know I would
  And if I was yours, but I'm not
  Now I'm ready to start
  If I was scared, I would
  And if I was pure, you know I would
  And if I was yours, but I'm not
 Now I'm ready to start
Now I'm ready to start
I would rather be wrong
Than live in the shadows of your song
My mind is open wide
And now I'm ready to start
And now I'm ready to start
My mind is open wide
And now I'm ready to start
Your mind surely opened the door
To step out into the dark
Now I'm ready
 I'll wait my turn I'm a modern man
 And the people behind they don't understand
 Makes me feel like 
 Makes me feel like
  So I wait in line I'm a modern man
 And the people behind they can't understand
 Makes me feel like 
 Something don't feel right
Like a record that's skippin' I'm a modern man
And the clock keeps tickin' I'm a modern man
 Makes me feel light
 Makes me feel right
 In my dream I was almost there
 Then they pulled me aside and said you're going nowhere
 They say we are the chosen few
 But we're wasted, and that's we're still waitin'
 On a number from the modern man
 Maybe when you're older you will understand
 Why you don't feel right
 Why you can't sleep at night now
In a line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man
In a line for a number but you don't understand
Like a modern man
 Oh I had a dream I was dreamin'
 And I feel like I'm losing the feelin'
 Makes me feel like 
 Something don't feel right
 I waste a number of the modern man
 Wanna break the mirror of the modern man
 Makes me feel like 
 Makes me feel like
 And you feel so right
 But how come you can't sleep at night?
 In line for a number but you don't understand
 Like a modern man
I'm a modern man
I'm a modern man
I'm a modern man
I'm a modern man
 Let's go downtown and watch the modern kids
 Let's go downtown and talk to the modern kids
 They will eat right out of your hand
  Using great big words that they don't understand, they're singin'
 Rococo Rococo Rococo Rococo

 Ooh ah ah,        ah ah ah ah ah ah
 Ooh ah ah,        ah ah ah ah ah ah
 They build it up, just to burn it back down

 The wind is blowing all the ashes around

 They want to own you but they don't know a game, they're playin'

Searching in, in an empty room
Searching in, in an empty room
Something I, would never do
Searching in, in an empty room
Searching in, in an empty room
Something I, would never do
I'm alone again
When I'm by myself, I can be myself
When my life is calm but I don't know when
You're burning out, you're black and gray
You're burning out, you're black and gray
Something I would never say
I'm alone again
Toute ma vie, est avec toi
Toute ma vie, est avec toi
Moi j'attends, toi tu pars
Toute ma vie, est avec toi
Toute ma vie, est avec toi
Moi j'attends, toi tu pars
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh
The summer that I broke my arm
I waited for your letter
I have no feeling for you now
Now that I know you better
I wish that I could have loved you then
Before our age was through
And before a world war does with us
Whatever it will do
Dreamed I drove home to Houston
On a highway that was underground
There was no light that we could see
As we listened to  the sound of the engine failing
I feel like I've been living in
A city with no children in it
A garden left for ruin by
A millionaire inside of a private prison
You never trust a millionaire 
Quoting the sermon on the mount
I used to think I was not like them
But I'm beginning to have my doubts, my doubts about it
When you're hiding underground
The rain can't get you wet
But do you think your righteousness 
Could pay the interest on your debt, I have my doubts about it
I feel like I've been living in
A city with no children in it
A garden left for ruin by
And by as I hide inside of my private prison
 You told us that
 We were too young
 Now that,  night's closing in
 And in the half light, we run
 Lock us up safe
 And hide the key
 But the,   night tears us loose
And in the half light, we're free
 Strange how the half light
 Can make a place new
 You can't   recognize me
 And I can't    recognize you
 We run through the streets
 That we know so well
 And the   houses hide so much
 We're in the half light
 None of us can tell
 They hide the ocean in a shell
 The ocean in a shell
 Our heads are just houses
 Without enough windows
 They say you  hear human voices
 But they    only echo
 They only echo
 They only echo
 Only echo
 We are not listening, we are on the streets
 We are not listening, we are on the streets
 We are not listening, we are on the streets
 We are not listening, we are on the streets
Now that San Francisco's gone, I guess I'll just pack it in
Wanna wash away my sins, in the presence of my friends
You and I we head back east, to find a town where we can live
Even in the half light, we can see that something's gotta give
When we watched the markets crash, the promises we made were torn
Then my parents sent for me, from out west where I was born
 Some people say, they've already lost
 But they're afraid to pay the cost 
For what we've lost
Pay the cost for what we've lost
Now that you have left me here, I will never raise my voice
All the diamonds you have here, in this moment which has no life
All the seas have changed so much, since I was a little child
Pray to god I won't live to see, the death of everything that's wild, wooh
Though we knew this day would come, still it took us by surprise
In this town where I was born, I now see through a dead man's eyes
 One day they,   will see it's long gone
 One day they,   will see it's long gone
 One day they,   will see it's long gone
 One day they,   will see it's long gone
Let's go for a drive, see the town tonight
There's nothing to do but I don't mind when I'm with you
This town's so strange they built it to change
And while we sleep we know its streets were rearranged
My old friends, can't remember when
Before your war against the suburbs began
Before it began
Now the music divides us into tribes
Grew your hair so I'll grew mine
So the past won't rest , till you jump the fence and leave it behind
My old friends, I can remember when
You cut your hair, I never saw you again
Now the cities we live in could be distant stars
And I searched for you in every passing car
 The nights are warm
 Yeah, the nights are warm, I've been
Living in the shadows of your song
Living in the shadows of your,    song
In the suburbs I, I learned to drive
You told me we would never survive,
So grab your mother's keys we leave tonight
But we started a war that we can't win
We keep erasing all the streets we grew up in
And now the music divides us into tribes
Choose your side, I'll choose my side
All my old friends, they don't know me now, oh-oh
All my old friends are staring through me now, oh-oh
All my old friends they don't know me now
All my old friends they don't know me now, oh-oh
They don't know me now
But my old friends, wait
Gonna make a record in the month of May
Gonna make a record in the month of May
When the violent wind blows the wires away
Well, some people singing sounds like screaming
 Used to doubt it but now I believe it
And just when I knew what I wanted to say
 The violent wind blew the wires away
Well, some things are pure and some things are right
But the kids are still standing with their arms folded tight
I said some things are pure and some things are right
But the kids are still with their arms folded tight
 I know it's heavy, I know it ain't light
But how you gonna lift it with your arms folded tight
And around and around and around and around
And around and around and around and around (And around and around and around and around)
When I stood outside in the month of May
And watched the violent wind blow the wires away
 Wish I may or I wish I might
You can meet me down there with my arms folded tight
Start again in the month of May       |
All those wasted hours we used to know
Spent the summer staring out the window
The wind it takes you where it wants to go
That's why we're still driving round and round
And all we see, are kids in buses longing to be free
Wasted hours, before we knew
Where to go, and what to do
Wasted hours, that you made new
And turned into, a life that we can live
Some cities make you lose your head
Endless suburbs stretched out thin and dead
And what was that line you said
You watch the life you're living disappear
And now I see we're still kids in buses longing to be free
Here, are my place and time
And here in my own skin, I can finally begin
Let the century pass me by
Standing under night sky, tomorrow means nothing
I, was only a child then
Feeling barely alive when I heard a song from the speaker of a passing car
And prayed to a dying star
The memory's fading I can almost remember singing
la, la la, la la la la
La la, la la, la la la
Ooh ooh ooh
We watched the end of the century
Compressed on a tiny screen, a dead star collapsing and we could see
That something was ending
Are you through pretending, we saw its signs in the suburbs
You could never have predicted
That he could see through you, Kasparov, Deep Blue, nineteen-ninety six
Your mind's pulling tricks now
The show is over so take a bow, we're living in the shadows
la, la la, la la la la
La la, la la, la la la
Ooh ooh ooh
Hey, put the cellphone down for a while
In the night there is something wild
Can you hear it breathing?
And hey, put the laptop down for a while
In the night there is something wild
I feel it, it's leaving me
 La la, la la, la la la la
 La la, la la, la la la la
 La la, la la, la la la la
 La la, la la, la la la la
I used to write
I used to write letters I used to sign my name
I used to sleep at night
Before the flashing lights settled deep in my brain
But by the time we met
By the time we met the times had already changed
So I never wrote a letter
I never took my true heart I never wrote it down
So when the lights cut out
I was lost standing in the wilderness downtown
Now our lives are changing fast
Now our lives are changing fast
Hope that something pure can last
Hope that something pure can last
But it seems strange
How we used to wait for letters to arrive
But what's stranger still
Is how something so small can keep you alive
We used to wait
We used to waste hours just walking around
We used to wait
All those wasted lives in the wilderness downtown
    Ooh we used to wait
    Ooh we used to wait
    Ooh we used to wait (Sometimes it never came)
    Ooh we used to wait (Sometimes it never came)
    Ooh we used to wait (Still moving through the pain)
I'm gonna write 
A letter to my true love I'm gonna sign my name
Like a patient on a table
I wanna walk again gonna move through the pain
Now our lives are changing fast
Now our lives are changing fast
Hope that something pure can last
Hope that something pure can last
   We used to wait
   We used to wait
   We used to wait
  We used to wait for it,   We used to wait for it
  Now we're screaming,  sing the chorus again
  We used to wait for it,   We used to wait for it
  Now we're screaming,  sing the chorus again
I used to wait for it,     I used to wait for it
  Hear my voice screaming, sing the chorus again
                 Wait for it
                 Wait for it
                 Wait for it
Took a drive into the sprawl
To find the house where we used to stay in
 Couldn't read the number in the dark
You said let's save it for another day
Took a drive into the sprawl
To find the places we used to play
 It was the loneliest day of my life
You're talking at me but I'm still far away
Let's take a drive, through the sprawl
Through these towns they built to change
 Then you said, the emotions are dead
It's no wonder that you feel so strange
Cops showing their lights, on the reflectors of our bikes
Said, do you kids know what time it is?
Well sir, it's the first time I've felt like something is mine
Like I have something to give
 The last defender of the sprawl
Said, well where do you kids live?
Well sir, if you only knew, what the answer is worth
Been searching every corner of the earth        
They heard me singing and they told me to stop
Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock
These days my life, I feel it has no purpose
But late at night the feelings swim to the surface
'Cause on the surface the city lights shine
They're calling at me, come and find your kind
Sometimes I wonder if the World's so small
That we can never get away from the sprawl
Living in the sprawl
Dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains
And there's no end in sight
I need the darkness, someone please cut the lights
We rode our bikes to the nearest park
Sat under the swings and kissed in the dark
We shield our eyes from the police lights
We run away, but we don't know why
On the black river, the city lights shine
They're screaming at us, we don't need your kind
Sometimes I wonder if the world's so small
That we can never get away from the sprawl
They heard me singing and they told me to stop
Quit these pretentious things and just punch the clock
Sometimes I wonder if the world's so small
Can we ever get away from the sprawl?
I need the darkness, someone please cut the lights
 If I could have it back
 All the time that we wasted
 I'd only waste it again
 If I could have it back
 You know I'd love to waste it again
 Waste it again and again and again
 I've got to ask
 Sometimes I can't believe it
 I'm moving past the feeling again
 Sometimes I can't believe it
 I'm moving past the feeling again

I’ve fallen down from grace
 A few too many times
But I find holy redemption
 When I put this car in drive
 Roll the windows down and turn up the dial
Can I get a hallelujah
 Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
 When I play the highway FM
 I find my soul revival
 Singing every single verse
 Yeah I guess that’s my church
When Hank bring the sermon
And Cash leads the choir
It gets my cold, cold heart burning
 Hotter than a ring of fire
When this wonderful world gets heavy
And I need to find my escape
I just keep the wheels rolling, radio scrolling
Until my sins wash away
Can I get a hallelujah
 Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya

 I find my soul revival

And every gambler knows that to lose
Is what you’re really there for
Summer I was fearless
Now I speak into an answer phone
Like every falling leaf on the breeze
Winter wouldn’t leave it alone - alone
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide
Baby every dog on the street
Knows that we’re in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing every breaking wave
Every sailor knows that the sea
Is a friend made enemy
And every shipwrecked soul knows what it is
To live without intimacy
I thought I heard the captain’s voice
It’s hard to listen while you preach
Like every broken wave on the shore 
This is as far as I could reach
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine
Are we so
Are we so helpless against the tide
Baby every dog on the street
knows that we’re in love with defeat
Are we ready to be swept off our feet
And stop chasing every breaking wave
The sea knows where are the rocks 
And drowning is no sin
You know where my heart is 
the same place that yours has been
We know that we fear to win and 
so we end before we begin  before we begin
If you go
If you go your way and I go mine

They took our innocent home

Like Jesus on the corner selling baggies full of blessing?
Is it stressing all the things that you have morally accepted?
Is it vexing wearing clothes that you have bled in?
Picture perfect victim, overwhelmed and so sadistic
I was looking for a purpose, what a chance you had some with you
On the street when I forgot, the city breathes when I do not
If I leave it does not stop here, no
So is there any treason in the tricky little price I paid?

Red for the cancer, Red for the wealthy,
Red for the drink that's mixed with suicide
Please won't you push me for the last time,
Let's scream until there's nothing left,
So sick of playing, I don't want this anymore.
The thought of you is no fucking fun,
You want a martyr, I'll be one
Because enough's enough, we're done.

Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
I'm tired of begging for the things that I want,
I'm over sleeping like a dog on the floor.

Intoxication, paranoia, and a lot of fame
Three cheers for throwing up, pubescent drama queen
You make me sick, I make it worse by drinking late.

So sick of playing, I don't want to anymore.

A single night without a ghost in the walls
And when the bass shakes the earth underground,
We'll start a new revolution, now

Blood for blood, hearts beating
Come at me, now this is war
OH                              the bridge comes in, but make sure each chord 
Now, Terror begins inside a bloodless vein
Born in this world without a voice or a say

Dying is a gift so close your eyes and rest in peace

non si vedono che muri vecchi umidi e incrostati non ricordo dove è il mare e nemmeno come è fatto
quattrocento euro al mese per un letto a soppalco
un mutuo è molto peggio me lo ha detto anche un mio amico
io mi fido ciecamente di quel che dice la gente e gli altri siamo noi e gli altri siamo tutti
e proprio questo mi spaventa siamo diventati brutti
amici siamo simili ma certo non uguali
io lo so che sono in crisi senza leggere i giornali
sono in crisi da una vita forse è la mia natura
anzi penso vivamente che sia proprio una fortuna
quella polvere nel naso non fa certo eccezione
con la voglia di esser sempre al centro dell'attenzione
certo son stato cattivo chiedo scusa ho sbagliato
la mancanza di rispetto dovrebbe essere un reato come anche l'idiozia e questa malinconia
che mi sale dentro al cuore quando entro a casa mia
non generalizzare e nemmeno devi urlare
che non è comunicare ed è pure antisociale Guccini lo sa bene non ho voglia di far niente
e anche se mai mi venisse a fermarmi c'è la gente
Il mio voto vale quanto quello di questo imbecille
allora cosa me ne frega delle vostre cinque stelle
E di tutte le parole che vi sento blaterare
sopra il bene comune l'amore universale
non provo vergogna se mi date del pezzente Certo io non ho il cash ma di essere attraente
e circondato da idioti non me ne frega niente
Di cosa ridete e di cosa urlate
perché festeggiate ancora l'estate
Di cosa ballate di cosa vi fate

viva il duce evviva la vita
viva il re viva gli sposi
viva la mamma evviva i tifosi
viva la pappa col pomodoro
viva la pace evviva il lavoro

I'm constant like the seasons, I will never be forgotten, man.

I've been feeling foolish,
You should try it,
She came and substituted,
the peace and quiet,
for acrobatic blood, flow, concertina
Cheating heartbeat,
Rapid fire.
She's Thunderstorms,
Lying on her front,
Up against the wall,
She's Thunderstorms,
Hear who's your host,
Sounds as if she's pretty close,
When the heat starts growing horns,
She's Thunderstorms.
She's been loop the looping,
Around my mind,
Her motorcycle boots give 
Me this kind of
Acrobatic blood, concertina
Cheating heartbeat
Rapid fire,
She's Thunderstorms,
Lying on her front,
Up against the wall,
She's Thunderstorms, in an unusual place,
When you're feeling far away,
She does what the night does to the day.
She's Thunderstorms,
Lying on her front,
Up against the wall,
She's Thunderstorms,
Thunderstorms,
Thunderstorms,

Waiting for the sky to fall
Then you called and changed it all,
Velvet lips and the eyes to pull me in,
We both know you'd already win,
Mm your original sin,
You fooled me once with your eyes now honey,
You fooled me twice with your lies and I say,
Sarah smiles like Sarah doesn't care,
She lives in her world so unaware,
Does she know  that my destiny lies with her,
Sarah (Sarah, Sarah, Sarah)
Oh Sarah (Sarah)  are you saving me?
Waking up to a kiss and you're on your way,
I really hoped that you would stay,
But you left and went your own way,
I don't mind take your time I got things to do,
Besides sit around and wait for you,
Oh and I hope you do too,
You fooled me once with your eyes now honey,
You fooled me twice with your lies and I say,
Sarah smiles like Sarah doesn't care,
She lives in her world so unaware,
Does she know  that my destiny lies with her,
Sarah,
Oh Sarah,   are you saving me?
And it's killing me inside,
Consuming all my time,You've left me blind,
And when I think I'm right,
You strip away my pride,
You cast it all aside but I say,
Sarah smiles like Sarah doesn't care,
She lives in her world so unaware,
Does she know  that my destiny lies with her,
Sarah (Sarah)
Oh Sarah (Sarah) are you saving me?

BTW, I don’t play the high E because it changes the G to a G6 and messes with its quality, so i just leave it 
Don't kill me just help me run away
From everyone I need a place to stay
Where I can cover up my face
   I am just a freak
   I am just a freak
My head is filled with parasites
Black holes cover up my eyes
I dream of you almost every night
   I won't wake up this time

I'll pour the water if you bring the tree
Nothing looks that real to me
I only see two or three colors
Whats it like to breath in?
Find a friend and gather with him?
I'm a wolf in a city of women
You only know the light is on
Will you plant that sycamore baby?
I'll watch it grow from the second floor
I haven't left the house much lately
And you don't come around here anymore
And all those lovers in their velvet gowns
I wanna take that trip uptown
Will you tell them to let me out
When you can see the light is on?
Found a horse hair in my food
There's a raccoon in my room
There are bluejays all in bloom
All along the cement floor
Randy, they say I've gone insane
So could you take me dancing in the pouring rain?
You don't know me but you know my name
Will you say it till the light is gone?

If you hate me then why do you care?
You said that we would go the distance.
Now you don't take me anywhere.
And I'll bite my tongue
And screw your heart.
And I can't stand, I can't stand you baby

We don't know which way to go, We don't know which way is home.

Outside the place that we call home.

I don't know what to say.

0,Torna A Casa,Måneskin,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/2480475,"Cammino per la mia città e il vento soffia forte
Mi son lasciato tutti indietro e il sole all'orizzonte
Vedo le case, da lontano, hanno chiuso le porte
Ma per fortuna ho la sua mano e le sue guance rosse
Lei mi ha raccolto da per terra coperto di spine
Coi morsi di mille serpenti fermo per le spire
Non ha ascoltato quei bastardi e il loro maledire
Con uno sguardo mi ha convinto a prendere e partire
Che questo è un viaggio che nessuno prima d'ora ha fatto
Alice, le sue meraviglie e il Cappellaio Matto
Cammineremo pe sta strada e non sarà mai stanco
Fino a che il tempo porterà  sui tuoi capelli il bianco
Che mi è rimasto un foglio in mano e mezza sigaretta
Restiamo un po' di tempo ancora tanto non c'è fretta
Che c'ho una frase scritta in testa ma non l'ho mai detta
Quindi Marlena torna a casa che il freddo qua si fa sentire
Quindi Marlena torna a casa che non voglio più aspettare
Quindi Marlena torna a casa che il freddo qua si fa sentire
Quindi Marlena torna a casa che ho paura di sparire
E il cielo piano piano qua diventa trasparente
Il sole illumina le debolezze della gente
Una lacrima salata bagna la mia guancia mentre
Lei con la mano mi accarezza in viso dolcemente
Col sangue sulle mani scalerò tutte le vette
Voglio arrivare dove l'occhio umano si interrompe
Per imparare a perdonare tutte le mie colpe
Perché anche gli angeli, a volte, han paura della morte
Che mi è rimasto un foglio in mano e mezza sigaretta
Corriamo via da chi c'ha troppa sete di vendetta
Da questa Terra ferma perché ormai la sento stretta;
Quindi Marlena torna a casa che il freddo qua si fa sentire
Quindi Marlena torna a casa che non voglio più aspettare
Quindi Marlena torna a casa che il freddo qua si fa sentire
Quindi Marlena torna a casa che non voglio più
Prima di te ero solo un pazzo ora lascia che ti racconti
Avevo una giacca sgualcita e portavo tagli sui polsi
Oggi mi sento benedetto e non trovo niente da aggiungere
Questa città si affaccia quando ci vedrà giungere
Ero in bilico tra l'essere vittima, essere giudice
Era un brivido che porta la luce dentro le tenebre
E ti libera da queste catene splendenti, lucide
Ed il dubbio no, se fossero morti oppure rinasci
Quindi Marlena torna a casa che il freddo qua si fa sentire
Quindi Marlena torna a casa che non voglio più aspettare
Quindi Marlena torna a casa che il freddo qua si fa sentire
Quindi Marlena torna a casa che non voglio più sparire
Quindi Marlena torna a casa che il freddo qua si fa sentire
Quindi Marlena torna a casa che ho paura di sparire

1,Like Real People Do,Hozier,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/hozier/like-real-people-do-chords-1731998,"I had a thought, dear
However scary
About that night
The bugs and the dirt
Why were you digging?
What did you bury
Before those hands pulled me
From the earth?
I will not ask you where you came from
I will not ask and neither should you
Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do
I knew that look dear
Eyes always seeking
Was there in someone
That dug long ago
So I will not ask you
Why you were creeping
In some sad way I already know
So I will not ask you where you came from
I would not ask and neither would you
Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do
I could not ask you where you came from
Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
We could just kiss like real people do

Half and half, make believe 'Cause so she thought, well my heart was on my sleeve
Honey, I cried too
You better believe it
Honey, my heart still beats for you

Beating
Never thought some silly songs could ever go and hurt someone
I never meant to sing my tune for anybody else out there but you

It’s raining, I suppose you need a ride
She said I’ve got nothing to do and neither do you
There’s a place down the road where we can waste the whole afternoon
I overhead that she was 19
She’s got a fake ID and a nose ring
Those kind of girls tend to know things
Better than I do
And I’m dying to figure out what she’s hiding
she’s playing it cool but she’s lying better than I do
It feels like a night to carry a tune
I’ve been carrying yours since you wrecked my room
And I’ve got nothing to do and neither do you
So we chase jack with love and waste away the whole afternoon

I need more

Promise I won't break your heart

  I feel like I've been lacking crying too many tears
  Everyone seemed to say it was so great
  But did I miss out was it a huge mistake
  I can't help the fact I like to be alone
  It might sound kinda sad, but that's just what I seem to know
  I tend to handle things usually by myself
  And I can't ever seem to try and ask for help
  I'm sitting here, crying in my prom dress
  I'd be the prom queen if crying was a contest
  Makeup is running down, feelings are all around
  How did I get here I need to know
  I guess I maybe had a couple expectations
  Thought I'd get to them, but no I didn't
  I guess I thought that prom was gonna be fun
But now I'm sitting on the floor and all I wanna do is run
  I keep collections of masks upon my wall
  To try and stop myself from revealing it all
  Affecting others is the last thing I would do
  I keep to myself though I want to break through
  I hold so many small regrets
  And what-ifs down inside my head
  Some confidence it couldn't hurt me
  My demeanor is often misread
  I'm sitting here, crying in my prom dress
  I'd be the prom queen if crying was a contest
  Makeup is running down, feelings are all around
  How did I get here I need to know
  I guess I maybe had a couple expectations
  Thought I'd get to them, but no I didn't
  I guess I thought that prom was gonna be fun

Where another died for me

And I’m shivering just thinking
Where have you been
All these minutes
I am too stressed out to
Do the thing that they won’t do
Why should I fight back
I’m just not like that
And I’m sorry if
I have been a real bad friend
Your face too close to mine
To hear you talk

Won’t you get up off, get up off the roof?
You’re scaring us and all of us, some of us love you
Achilles, it’s not much but there’s proof
You crazy-ass cosmonaut, remember your virtue
Redemption lies plainly in truth
Just humor us, Achilles, Achilles, come down
Won’t you get up off, get up off the roof?
Achilles, Achilles, Achilles, come down
Won’t you get up off, get up off the roof?
The self is not so weightless, nor whole and unbroken
Remember the pact of our youth
Where you go, I’m going, so jump and I’m jumping
Since there is no me without you
Soldier on, Achilles, Achilles, come down
Won’t you get up off, get up off the roof?
Loathe the way they light candles in Rome
But love the sweet air of the votives
Hurt and grieve but don’t suffer alone
Engage with the pain as a motive
Today of all days, see
How the most dangerous thing is to love
How you will heal and you’ll rise above
Achilles, Achilles, Achilles, jump now
You are absent of cause or excuse
So self-indulgent and self-referential
No audience could ever want you
You crave the applause yet hate the attention
Then miss it, your act is a ruse
It is empty, Achilles, so end it all now
It's a pointless resistance for you
Achilles, Achilles, just put down the bottle
Don’t listen to what you’ve consumed
It’s chaos, confusion, and wholly unworthy
Of feeling and it’s wholly untrue
You may feel no purpose nor a point for existing
It’s all just conjecture and gloom
There may not be meaning, so find one and seize it
Do not waste yourself on this roof
Hear those bells ring deep in the soul
Chiming away for a moment
Feel your breath course frankly below
See life as a worthy opponent
Today of all days, see
How the most dangerous thing is to love
How you will heal and you’ll rise above
Crowned by an overture bold and beyond
Ah, it’s more courageous to overcome
You want the acclaim, the mother of mothers
                          (It’s not worth it, Achilles)
More poignant than fame or the taste of another
                                  (Don’t listen, Achilles)
Be real and just jump, you dense motherfucker
                               (You’re worth more, Achilles)
You will not be more than a rat in the gutter
                              (So much more than a rat)
You want my opinion, my opinion you’ve got
You asked for my counsel, I gave you my thoughts
Be done with this now and jump off the roof
Can you hear me, Achilles? I’m talking to you
I’m talking to you
I’m talking to you
I’m talking to you
Achilles, come down
Achilles, come down
Throw yourself into the unknown
With a pace and a fury defiant
Clothe yourself in beauty untold
And see life as a means to a triumph
Today of all days, see
How the most dangerous thing is to love
How you will heal and you’ll rise above
Crowned by an overture bold and beyond
Ah, it’s more courageous to overcome

In my youth, a vampire
Evelyn shown quiet as roses sting
It came over me at a bad time
But who wouldn't ride on a moonlight line?
I had her in my eye, 85 down the road of a dead-end gleam
And she said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too
It came over her at a bad time
Riding through Winona down the dotted line
Held us gunning out
90 miles down the road of a dead end dream
She looked over with a part smile
Caught up in the twinkle, it could take awhile
And the money pile on the dashboard fluttering
As she said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too
Evelyn's kiss was oxygen
I leaned over to take it in
As we went howling through the edge of south Des Moines
It came over me at a bad time
She burned over the double line
And she impaled as I reached my hand for the guardrail
Ooh the guardrail

Justified in the way you make me bruise

I was lost and lost my shape

There was nothing but quiet retractions
And families pleading, ""Don't look in that cabinet, there's far more bad than there's good,

Twenty hours out of Homestake eternity
""You can go anywhere but you are where you came from""

Let me hold you above all the misery
Let me open my eyes and be glad that I got here

  You've been asking but I don't have an answer
  How come?
  I'm still thinking, let's pretend to fall asleep now
  When we get old, will we regret this?
  Too young to think about all that shit
  And stalling only goes so far when you've got a head start
  'Cause we could stay at home and watch the sunset
  But I can't help from asking, ""Are you bored yet?""
  And if you're feeling lonely you should tell me
  Before this ends up as another memory
  Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie?
  Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie?
  Feels like I've known you my whole life
I can see right through your lies
  I don't know where we're going
But I'd like to be by your side
  If you could tell me how you're feeling
Maybe we'd get through this undefeated
  Holding on for so long
  'Cause we could stay at home and watch the sunset

There at the start, before the beginning of time
With no point of reference
You spoke to the dark and fleshed out the wonder of light
And as You speak
A hundred billion galaxies are born
In the vapour of Your breath the planets form
If the stars were made to worship, so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've made
Every burning star, a signal fire of grace
If creation sings Your praises, so will I
God of Your promise
You don't speak in vain, no syllable empty or void
For once You have spoken
All nature and science, follow the sound of Your voice
And as You speak
A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
Evolving in pursuit of what You said
If it all reveals Your nature, so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You say
Every painted sky, a canvas of Your grace
If creation still obeys You, so will I
(So will I,    so will I)
If the stars were made to worship, so will I
If the mountains bow in reverence, so will I
If the oceans roar Your greatness, so will I
For if everything exists to lift You high, so will I
And if the wind goes where You send it, so will I
If the rocks cry out in silence, so will I
If the sum of all our praises still falls shy
Then we'll sing again a hundred billion times
Whoa
God of salvation
You chased down my heart through all of my failure and pride
On a hill You created
The light of the world abandoned in darkness to die
And as You speak
A hundred billion failures disappear
Where You lost Your life so I could find it here
If You left the grave behind You, so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've done
Every part designed in a work of art called love
If You gladly chose surrender, so will I
I can see in Your heart, eight billion different ways
Every precious one, a child You died to save
If You gave Your life to love them, so will I
Like You would again a hundred billion times
But what measure could amount to Your de - sire
You're the One who never leaves the one behind

This life has many shades
I’d wake up every morning and before I’d start each day
I’d take a drag from last nights cigarette
That smoldered in it’s tray
Down a little something and then be on my way
I traveled far and wide
And laid this head in many ports
I was guided by a compass
I saw beauty to the north
I drew the tales of many lives
And wore the faces of my own
I had these memories all around me
So I wouldn’t be alone
Some may be from showing up
Others are from growing up
Sometimes I was so messed up and didn’t have a clue
I ain’t winning no one over
I wear it just for you

Mischief, gold and piracy
This ones for the man that raised me
Taught me sacrifice and bravery
This ones for our favorite game
Black and gold, we wave the flag
This ones for my family name
With pride I wear it to the grave

Others are from growing up

Stays here for eternity
A ship that always stays the course
An anchor for my every choice
A rose that shines down from above
I signed and sealed these words in blood
I heard them once, sung in a song
It played again and we sang along
You’ll always be there with me
Even if you’re gone
You’ll always have my love
Our memory will live on

Others are from growing up

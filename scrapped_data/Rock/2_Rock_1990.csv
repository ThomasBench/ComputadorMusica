Were laid spread out before me as her body once did
All five horizons revolved around her soul as the earth to the sun
Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn
Oh, and all I taught her was everything
Oh, I know she gave me all that she wore
And now my bitter hands,
Chafe beneath the clouds
Of what was everything
All the pictures have
All been washed in black
Tattooed everything
I take a walk outside, I'm surrounded by some kids at play
I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear
Oh, and twisted thoughts that spin 'round my head, I'm spinning, oh
I'm spinning, how quick the sun can drop away
And now my bitter hands
Cradle broken glass
Of what was everything
All the pictures have
All been washed in black
Tattooed everything
All the love gone bad
Turned my world to black
And tattooed all I see,
All that I am,
All that I'll be
  Yeah  Uh huh  Uh huh  Uh
I know someday you'll have a beautiful life,
I know you'll be a star in somebody else's sky
But why, why, why can't it be,
Oh can't it be mine

 She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good, so I can see my baby when I leave this world
We were out on a date in my daddy's car, we hadn't driven very far
There in the road, straight ahead, a car was stalled, the engine was dead
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right, I’ll never forget the sound that night
The screaming tires, the bustin' glass, the painful scream that I heard last
Oh where, oh where can my baby be? The Lord took her away from me
 She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good, so I can see my baby when I leave this world
When I woke up, the rain was pouring down, there were people standing all around
Something warm going through my eyes, but somehow I found my baby that night
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said: Hold me darling just a little while
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss, I'd found the love that I knew I had missed
Well, now she's gone, even though I hold her tight, I lost my love my life that night

Steal the warm wind tired friend.

And sometimes far too long for snakes.

And my youth I pray to keep.

Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded
Life's mysteries seem so faded
I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am just drowning in the rain

And everything seems cut and dry
Day and night, earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it

At this old piano
Trying hard to capture the moment
This morning I don't know
'Cause a bottle of vodka's still lodged in my head
And some blond gave me nightmares
Think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead
With an iron-clad fist
I wake up, and French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat
In my head while we're talking
About all of the things, that I long to believe
About love, the truth, what you mean to me
And the truth is
Baby, you're all that I need
I wanna lay
You down in a bed of roses
For tonight
I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh, I want to be
Just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
  On a bed of roses
Well, I'm so far away
Each step that I take's on my way home
A King's ransom in dimes
I give each night to sing through this payphone
Still I run out of time
Or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes, and whisper
Baby, blind love is true
I wanna lay
You down in a bed of roses
For tonight
I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh, I want to be
Just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
  On a bed of roses
Well, this hotel bar hangover
Whiskey's gone dry, the barkeeper's wig's crooked
I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died, uh yeah!...
Now as you close your eyes
Know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight, I won't be alone
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove for it's you
That I'd die to defend
I wanna lay
You down in a bed of roses
For tonight
I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh, I want to be
Just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
I wanna lay
You down in a bed of roses
For tonight
I sleep on a be...ed of nails!

Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here,
We was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road.
All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon...
In the middle of the road.
And he said:
""Play the best song in the world, or I'll eat your souls.""
Well me and Kyle, we looked at each other,
And we each said...   ""Okay""
And we played the first thing that came to our heads,
Just so happened to be,
The Best Song in the World, it was The Best Song in the World.
Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
One and one make two, two and one make three,
It was destiny.
Once every hundred-thousand years or so,
When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow
And the grass don't grow...
Needless to say, the beast was stunned.
Whip-crack went his schwumpy tail,
And the beast was done.
He asked us: ""Be you angels?""
And we said, ""Nay. We are but men!"" ROCK!
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh-ah-ah,
Ohhh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh!
This is not The Greatest Song in the World.
No, this is just a tribute.
Couldn't remember The Greatest Song in the World.
No, this is a tribute, oh.
   To The Greatest Song in the World, All right!
   It was The Greatest Song in the World, All right!
It was the best muthafuckin' song
The greatest song in the world.
And the peculiar thing is this my friends:
The song we sang on that fateful night,
It didn't actually sound anything like this song.
This is just a tribute! You gotta' believe me!
And I wish you were there! Just a matter of opinion.
Ah,what the fuck! Good God, Gotta love 'em,
  So surprised to find you can't stop me now.
The fiery ring of fire!
Ritsss motherfucker, the perfect song!

but without you I give up

are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair,
to touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
when he says the words you've been needing to hear
I'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mine

And I will love you, baby

  I could
  If you told me to die for you
I would

There's no price I won't pay
to say these words to you
Well, there ain't no luck in these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
we can pack up our old dreams and our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines

  Cool kids never have the time.
On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet.
  Junebug skipping like a stone
  With headlights pointed at the dawn.
  We were sure we'd never see
An end to it all.
And I don't even  care to shake these zipper blues,
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below.
  Double cross the vacant and the bored,
  They're not sure just what we have in store.
  Morphine city slippin' dues down to see:
That we don't even  care as restless as we are,
We feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts.
And poured cement,
Lamented and assured.
To the lights and towns below,
Faster than the speed of sound,
Faster than we thought we'd go beneath the sound of hope.
  Justine never knew the rules,
  Hung down with the freaks and ghouls.
No a-pologies ever need be made,
  I know you better than you fake it to see:
That we don't even  care to shake these zipper blues,
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess,
Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below.
  The street heats the urgency of now.
  As you see there's no one around.

 If you want to
It's okay 
 If you need to
You can run but you can never hide
From the shadow that's creeping up beside you
 There's a magic running through your soul
But you can't have it all
 I'll be two steps behind you (Wherever you go)                 
 And I'll be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around
I'll be two steps behind
Yeah, yeah
Take the time 
 To think about it
Just walk the line, you know you just can't fight it
Take a look around and see what you can find
Like the fire that's burning up inside me
 Now there's a magic running through your soul
But you can't have it all
 I'll be two steps behind you (Wherever you go)

That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around
I'll be two steps behind

Ohh
Ohh, there's a magic running through your soul
But you, you can't have it all
 I'll be two steps behind you (Wherever you go)                 
 And I'll be there to remind you
That it only takes a minute of your precious time
To turn around
I'll be two steps behind
Yeah, baby
Two steps behind

1,1952 Vincent Black Lightning,Richard Thompson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/richard-thompson/1952-vincent-black-lightning-chords-86893,"Said Red Molly to James, that's a fine motorbike,
A girl could feel special on any such like
Said James to Red Molly, well my hat's off to you
It's a Vincent Black Lightning, 1952
And I've seen you at the corners and cafes it seems
Red hair and black leather, my favourite colour scheme
And he pulled her on behind 
And down to Boxhill they did ride
Said James to Red Molly, here's a ring for your right hand
But I'll tell you in earnest I'm a dangerous man
I've fought with the law since I was seventeen
I robbed many a man to get my Vincent machine
Now I'm 21 years, I might make 22
And I don't mind dying, but for the love of you
And if fate should break my stride
I'll give you my Vincent to ride
Come down, come down, Red Molly, called Sergeant McRae
For they've taken young James Adie for armed robbery
Shotgun blast hit his chest, left nothing inside
Come down, Red Molly to his dying bedside
When she came to the hospital, there wasn't much left
He was running out of road, he was running out of breath
But he smiled to see her cry 
Said I'll give you my Vincent to ride
Said young James in my opinion, there's nothing in this world
Beats a 52 Vincent and a red headed girl
Now Nortons and Indians and Greeveses won't do
They don't have a soul like a Vincent 52
And he reached for her hand and he slipped her the keys
He said I don't have any further use for these
I see angels on Ariels in leather and chrome
Swooping down from heaven to carry me home
He gave her one last kiss and died
And he gave her his Vincent to ride.

Plateau's clean, no dirt to be seen and the work, it was fun

Dressed up like a car crash
Your wheels are turnin' but you're upside down
 You say when he hits you, you don't mind
 Because when he hurts you, you feel alive
Oh, is that what it is?
Red lights, grey morning
You stumble out of a hole in the ground
A vampire or a victim?
It depends on who's around
You used to stay in to watch the adverts
You could lip-synch to the talk shows
 And if you look, you look through me
 And when you talk, you talk at me
 And when I touch you, you don't feel a thing
If I could stay then the night would give you up
Stay and the day would keep it's trust
Stay and the night would be enough
Faraway, so close
Up with the static and the radio
With satelite television
you can anywhere
Miami, New Orleans, London, Belfast and Berlin
 And if you listen I can't call
 And if you jump you just might fall
And if you shout I'll only hear you
If I could stay then the night would give you up
Stay then the day would keep it's trust
Stay with the demons you drowned
Stay with the spirits I found
Stay and the night would be enough

 Basta't tayo'y nagsasama at nag iinuman.""
 Kaya naman ako bilib sa iyo
 Kasi parang napakatibay mo
 Lahat ng iharang ay kaya mong daanan
 Basta't mayrong bentang alak   diyan sa may tindahan.
 Hoy hoy, Buloy
 Naalala mo pa ba nung araw na nadedo
 Ang aso mong si Morlock
 Hoy hoy, Buloy
 Naalala mo pa ba nung ika'y tumawag sa 'min
 At ika'y umiiyak.
 Tapos, pagkatapos non, kay tagal mong nawala
 Nagulat na lang ako nung narinig ko ang balita
 Akala ko pa naman na marunong kang magdala
 Nalaman ko na lang na ika'y nagpakamatay na.
 Hoy Buloy, nasaan ka man
 Siguradong kawawa ka, malamang walang alak diyan
 Hoy Buloy, nasaan ka man
 Siguradong hindi ka namin malilimutan
 Hoy Buloy, Buloy, Buloy. 
 Hoy Buloy, nasaan ka man
 Siguradong kawawa ka, malamang walang alak diyan
 Hoy Buloy, nasaan ka man
 Siguradong hindi ka namin malilimutan
 Hoy Buloy, Buloy, Buloy. 
 Hoy hoy, Buloy
 Para bang nalimot mo na
 Ang iyong mga sinabi nung ikaw ay buhay pa.

And then someday

Oh you were flyin' oh so high 
But then someday people look at you for what they call their own 
They watch you suffer 
Yeah they hear you calling home

To brush the leaves aside so you can reach us

No, no, no

Now maybe I could have made my own mistakes
But I live with what I've known 
And then maybe we might share in something great
But won't you look at where we've grown
Won't you look at where we've gone
But then someday comes tomorrow holds a sense of what I feel for you in my mind 
As you trip the final line
And that cold day when you lost control 
Shame you left my life so soon you should have told me

Tak, zawsze genialny
Idealny muszę być
I muszę chcieć, super luz i już
Setki bzdur i już, to nie ja
I nawet kiedy będę sam
nie zmienię się, to nie mój świat.
Przede mną droga, którą znam,

Wiesz, lubię wieczory
Lubię się schować na jakiś czas
I jakoś tak, nienaturalnie
Trochę przesadnie, pobyć sam
Wejść na drzewo i patrzeć w niebo
Tak zwyczajnie, tylko że
Tutaj też wiem kolejny raz
Nie mam szans być kim chcę
I nawet kiedy będę sam
nie zmienię się, to nie mój świat.
Przede mną droga, którą znam,
którą ja, wybrałem sam.
Noc, a nocą gdy nie spię
Wychodzę choć nie chcę spojrzeć na
Chemiczny swiat, pachnący szarością
Z papieru miloscią, gdzie ty i ja
I jeszcze ktoś, nie wiem kto
Chciałby tak przez kilka lat
Zbyt zachłannie i trochę przesadnie
Pobyć chwilę sam, chyba go znam
I nawet kiedy będę sam
nie zmienię się, to nie mój świat.
Przede mną droga, którą znam,
którą ja, wybrałem sam.
I nawet kiedy będę sam
nie zmienię się, to nie mój świat.

In the middle of the pouring rain
W.C. Handy -- won't you look down over me
Yeah I got a first class ticket
But I'm as blue as a boy can be
Then I'm walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?
Saw the ghost of Elvis
On Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
Then I watched him walk right through
Now security they did not see him
They just hovered 'round his tomb
But there's a pretty little thing, Waiting for the King
Then I'm walking in Memphis
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel?
They've got catfish on the table
They've got gospel in the air
And Reverend Green be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
But boy you've got a prayer in Memphis
Now Muriel plays piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would
Do a little number
And I sang with all my might
And she said, ""Tell me are you a Christian child?""

Sweet communist
Standing on the sea-weed water
Semen stains the mountain tops
semen stains the mountain tops
With cocoa leaves along the border
Sweetness sings from every corner 
Cars careening from the clouds
The bridges burst and twist around
And wanting something warm and moving
Bends towards herself the soothing 
Proves that she must still exist
She moves herself about her fist
Sweet communist
Standing on the sea-weed water
Semen stains the mountain tops

bakit lagi mo na lang sinasaktan ang puso ko
tandang tanda ko pa noong tayo'y namamasyal
napasulyap lang sa iba bigla mo na kong sinampal
at sa kaseselos mo nga'y lalong minahal kita 
subalit nasaan ka na sumama sa iba
bakit bakit ba iniwan mong nag iisa 
bakit bakit ba sa akin bay nag sawa na
sinusunod naman kita kahit ano kinakaya
wala pa ring kwenta bakit ba
ano ba ang nakita mo at pinag palit mo ko
naka sisiguro ka ba ngayon sa bago mo
sana ay mahalin ka nya at wag kang sasaktan
kahit di na tayo'y problema mo'y sabihin lang
pilit ka mang limutan ay naghihintay parin
nagbabaka sakali na muli kang dumating
bakit ba kay hirap ng kalagayan ko ngayon
kaya't saking sarili ay laging nagtatanong
bakit bakit ba iniwan mong nag iisa

And there's glass on the lawn
Tacks on the floor
And the TV is on
And I always sleep with my guns
When you're gone
There's a blade by the bed
And a phone in my hand
A dog on the floor
And some cash on the nightstand
When I'm all alone the dreaming stops
And I just can't stand
What should I do I'm just a little baby
What if the lights go out and maybe
And then the wind just starts to moan
Outside the door he followed me home
Well goodnight moon I want the sun
If it's not here soon I might be done
No it won't be too soon 'til I say
Goodnight moon
There's a shark in the pool
And a witch in the tree
A crazy old neighbour
and he's been watching me
And there's footsteps loud and strong
coming down the hall
Something's under the bed
Now it's out in the hedge
There's a big black crow
sitting on my window ledge
And I hear something scratching
through the wall
Oh what should I do I'm just a little baby
What if the lights go out and maybe
I just hate to be all alone
Outside the door he followed me home
Now goodnight moon I want the sun
If it's not here soon I might be done
No it won't be too soon 'til I say
Goodnight moon
Well you're up so high
How can you save me
When the dark comes here
Tonight to take me up
To my front walk and into bed
Where it kisses my face and eats my head
Oh what should I do I'm just a little baby
What if the lights go out and maybe
And then the wind just starts to moan
Outside the door he followed me home
Now goodnight moon I want the sun
If it's not here soon I might be done
No it won't be too soon 'til I say

To hear the west wind whistle to the east

Saying ain't nobody that can sing like me
Ain't nobody that can sing like me 
Way over yonder in the minor key

  and those who play,   never suspect,
    he doesnt play,      for the mo  - ney he wins,
    he doesnt play    for   respect.
  He deals the cards to find the answers,
    the sacred geometry of chance,
    a hidden law,       of a pro -  bable outcome,
    the numbers lead   a   dance.
   I know that the spades, are the swords of a soldier,
   I know that the clubs are weapons of war,
   I know that diamonds,      are mo -  ney for this art,
but thats not the shape of my heart.
   And he may play the jack of diamonds,  
   he may lay the queen of spades,
   he may conceal, a king in his hand,
    while the memory of it fades.
   I know that the spades, are the swords of a soldier,
   I know that the clubs are weapons of war,
   I know that diamonds,      are mo -  ney for this art,
but thats not the shape of my heart.
   And if I told you that I loved you,
   you maybe think there's something wrong,
   I'm not a man,    of two   many faces,
   the mask I wear is one.
   And all those that speak know nothing, 
   and they'll find out to their cost,
   and those that curse their luck, in  too  many places,
   are those that fear  are  lost.
   I know that the spades, are the swords of a soldier,

Thinking 'bout you every day
Dreaming 'bout you every night
I'm hoping that you feel the same way

früher war'n wir oft gemeinsam hier, das macht mir, macht mir nichts!
Gegenüber sitzt 'n Typ wie'n Bär, ich stell' mir vor, wenn das dein Neuer wär',
Das juckt mich, ... überhaupt nicht.
Auf einmal packt's mich, ich geh auf ihn zu und mach ihn an, lass meine Frau in Ruh!
Er fragt nur:... Hast du'n Stich?
Und ich denke schon wieder nur an dich...
Verdammt, ich lieb' dich, ich lieb' dich nicht.
Verdammt, ich brauch' dich, brauch' dich nicht.
Verdammt, ich will dich, ich will dich nicht,

Verdammt, ich will dich, ich will dich nicht,
Ich will dich nicht verlier'n!
So langsam fällt mir alles wieder ein:
Ich wollt doch nur'n bisschen freier sein. Jetzt bin ich's,... oder nicht?
Ich passte nicht in deine heile Welt,
doch die und du ist, was mir jetzt so fehlt, ich glaub das,.. einfach nicht.
Gegenüber steht 'n Telefon, es lacht mich ständig an voll Hohn,
Es klingelt, klingelt aber nicht.
Sieben Bier, zuviel geraucht, das ist es, was ein Mann so braucht,
Doch niemand, niemand sagt: ""Hör auf"".

That I don't know of your sins
Until you are ready to confess
But all the time, all the time
I'll know, I'll know
And you can use my skin
To bury secrets in
And I will settle you down
And at my own suggestion
I will ask no questions
While I do my thing in the background
But all the time, all the time
I'll know, I'll know
Baby -- I can't help you out
While she's still around
So for the time being
I'm being patient
And amidst this bitterness
If you'll just consider this
Even if it don't make sense
All the time, give it time
And when the crowd becomes your burden
And you've early closed your curtain
I'll wait by the backstage door
While you try to find
The lines to speak your mind
And pry it open hoping for an encore
And if it gets too late for me to wait
For you to find you love me, and tell me so
It's ok, don't need to say it...

We were goin' down
I can feel the sinkin'
But then I came around
And everyone I've loved before
Flashed before my eyes
And nothin' mattered anymore
I looked into the sky
Well we all want something better than
We wish for something new
Well we all want something beautiful
Wish for something true
Been lookin' for a reason and
Something to lose
When the wheels come down
When the wheels touch ground
And you feel like it's all over
There's another round for you
When the wheels come down 
Now your head is spinnin'
Broken hearts will mend
This is our beginning
Comin to an end
Well, you wanted something beautiful
You wished for something new
Well, you wanted something better than
Wished for something true

new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee
 to go
You tell me your life's been way off
 line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carrying on
Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it
 around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie

 ride
You had a bad day

You're coming back down and you really
don't mind

I'd read it every day
So here's your holiday

enjoy it this time
you gave it all away
it was mine
so when you're dead and gone
will you,
twenty years now lost?
The anger hurts my ears
Been running strong for seven years
Rather then fix the problem
They never solve them
It makes no sense at all

We get along so why can't they?

And it's what she wants

On the border line of the edge

Fucked up and everything's all right
Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive

It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know, time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal, didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
I wasted it all just to 
Watch you go, I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard, in spite of the way you were mocking me
 Acting like I was part of your property
  Remembering all the times you fought with me
  I'm surprised it got so far
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
  Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me
In the end you kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when
I tried so hard and got so far

Pushed as far as I can go

6,Why Georgia (ver 3),John Mayer,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-mayer/why-georgia-chords-393249," I am driving up eighty five in the 
 Kind of morning that  lasts all afternoon 
 I’m just stuck inside the gloom 
 Four more exits to my apartment but 
 I am tempted to keep the car in drive 
    And leave it all behind 
‘Cause I... wonder sometimes about the outcome
Of a still verdictless life 
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why,     why Georgia, why? 
Rent a room and I fill the spaces with 
Wood in places to make it feel like home 
   But all I feel’s alone 
It might be a quarter life crisis 
   Or just the stirring in my soul 
Either way  I... wonder sometimes about the outcome
Of a still verdictless life 
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why,     why Georgia, why? 
    So what     so I’ve      got a smile on?
    It’s hiding the quiet superstitions in my head 
Don’t believe me
Don’t believe me
When I say      I’ve    got     it down 
 Everybody is just a stranger, but
 that’s the danger in going my own way 
    I guess it’s the price I have to pay
Still “everything happens for a reason” is no 
reason    not to    ask myself if I am 
     Living it right
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why,     tell me why… 
Why,     why Georgia, why?

 Who says I can't take time
 Meet all the girls in the county line
 Wait on fate to send a sign

 It's been a long night in Austin too
 I don't remember you looking any better
 But then again I don't remember you
 Who says I can't get stoned
 Plan a trip to Japan alone
 Doesn't matter if I even go
 Who says I can't get stoned, hmmm
 It's been a long night in New York City
It's been a long time since twenty-two
 I don't remember you looking any better
 But then again I don't remember, don't remember you

She couldn’t spend, one day alone

When you have, everything
You have everything to lose
She made herself, a bed of nails
And she’s planning, on putting it to use
But she had diamonds on the inside

Diamonds
A candle throws its light, into the darkness
In a nasty world, so shines a good deed
Make sure the fortune, that you seek
Is the fortune that you need
Tell me why, the first to ask
Is the last, to give every time
What you say, and do not mean
Follows you close behind

She had diamonds on the inside
She wore diamonds on the inside

Like the soldier long standing, under fire
Any change, comes as a relief
Let the givers name, remain unspoken
She is just a generous thief

She had diamonds on the inside
She wore diamonds on the inside
She wore diamonds
Oh diamonds

They crawl in like a cockroach leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I’m alone
Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you; will you never call again?
And will you never say that you love me just to put it in my face?
And will you never try to reach me; It is I that wanted space
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you
I’m sober now for 3 whole months it’s one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing I won’t touch again
In my sick way I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I’ll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you
And with a sad heart I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made
And like a baby boy I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling ‘Make it go away!’
Just make a smile, come back and shine, like it used to be
And then she whispered ‘How can you do this to me?’
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you

 Its the morning of your very first day
 You say hi to your friends you aint seen in a while
 Try and stay out of everybodys way
 It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
 For the next four years in this town
 Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
 You know I haven't seen you around, before
 'Cause when you're fifteen and 
 Somebody tells you they love you
 You're gonna believe them
 And when you're fifteen
 Feeling like there's nothing to figure out
 Well count to ten, take it in
 This is life before you know who you're gonna be
 At fifteen
 You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
 And soon enough you're best friends
 Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
 We'll be out of here as soon as we can
 And then you're on your very first date
 And he's got a car and you're feeling like flying
 And you're momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
 And you're dancing round your room when the night ends
 When the night ends
 'Cause when you're fifteen and 
 Somebody tells you they love you
 You're gonna believe them
 And when you're fifteen
 And your first kiss makes your head spin 'round
 But in your life you'll do things greater than
 Dating the boy on the football team
 But I didnt know it at fifteen
 When all you wanted was to be wanted
 Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
 Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
 But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
 And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy 
 Who changed his mind and we both cried
 'Cause when you're fifteen and 
 Somebody tells you they love you
 You're gonna believe them
 And when you're fifteen
 Don't forget to look before you fall
 I've found time can heal most anything
 And you just might find who you're supposed to be
 I didn't know who I was supposed to be
 At fifteen
         La la la la la 
 La la la la la
 Your very first day, take a deep breath girl
 Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

Fell in love , found out first hand.
Went well for a week or two
Then it all came unglued
In a trap , trip I can’t grip
Never thought I’d be the one who’d slip
Then I started to realize
I was livin one big lie
She fucking hates me,                         trust
She fucking hates me,               la la la love
I tried too hard and she tore my feelings like I had none
and ripped them away!!
She was queen for about an hour
After that she got sour
She took all I ever had
No sign of guilt,  not feeling bad  nooooooo!!
In a trap , trip I can’t grip

The dust has only just begun to form
crop circles in the carpet, sinking, feeling
Spin me around again and rub my eyes
this can't be happening
When busy streets a mess with people would stop to hold their heads heavy
Hide   and      seek
trains and sewing machines?
All those    years    they were here first
Oily marks appear on walls
where pleasure moments hung before
the takeover, the sweeping insensitivity of this
still life
Hide and seek
trains and sewing machines? (Oh, you won't catch me around here)
blood and tears they were here first

oh that you only meant well, well of course you did

47,Play Crack The Sky,Brand New,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/brand-new/play-crack-the-sky-chords-89268,"We sent out the SOS call
It was a quarter past four
In the morning
When the storm broke    our second anchor line.
  Four months at sea.
Four months of calm seas
to    be  pounded in the shallows
Off   the tip of Montauk Point.
  They call them rogues.
They    travel fast and alone,
One hundred foot faces
Of God's good ocean gone wrong
What they call love is a risk,
'Cause you   will always get hit
Out    of nowhere
By some wave and    end up on your own.
  The hole in the hull defied the crews attempts
  To bail us out.
  But it flooded the engines and radio
  half buried bow.
Your tongue is a rudder.
It steers the whole ship.
Sends your words past your lips
Or keeps them safe behind your teeth.
But the wrong words will strand you.
Come   off course while you sleep.
Sweep your boat out to sea
Or dashed to bits on the reef.
  The vessel groans
The oc - ean pressures its frame.
To the port I see the lighthouse
Through the sleet and the rain.
And I wish for one more day
To give my love and repay debts.
But the morning finds our bodies
Washed    up thirty miles west.
  They say that the captain
Stays fast with the ship
Through still and storm.
  But this ain't the Dakota.
And the water is cold.
We won't have to fight for long.
  This story's old
Until we disappear.
  I am the one who haunts your dreams
  I spoke the words but never
  I know that this is what you want.
  You know that you are not alone.
  This story's old
Until we disappear.
  I am the one who haunts your dreams
  I spoke the words but never
  I know that this is what you want.
  You know that you are not alone.
This is the end.

    I don't want this moment
      to ever end
    where everything's nothing
without you
    I'd wait here forever just to,
to see you smile
'Cause it's true
I am nothing without you
Through it all
I've made my mistakes
I stumble and fall
But I mean these words
I want you to know
with everything I won't let this go
these words are my heart and soul
I'll hold on to this moment you know
cause I'd bleed my heart out to show
that I won't let go
    Thoughts read unspoken
      forever in doubt
    And pieces of memories
fall to the ground
    I know what I didn't have so
   I won't let this go
'Cause it's true
I am nothing without you
All the streets
where I walked alone
with nowhere to go
have come to an end
I want you to know
with everything I won't let this go
these words are my heart and soul
I'll hold on to this moment you know
'Cause I'd bleed my heart out to show
that I won't let go
    In front of your eyes
it falls from the skies
when you don't know
what you're looking to find
in front of your eyes
it falls from the skies
when you just never know
what you will find
    I don't want this moment
      to ever end
    where everything's nothing
without you
I want you to know
with everything I won't let this go
these words are my heart and soul
I'll hold on to this moment you know
'Cause I'd bleed my heart out to show
that I won't let go
I want you to know
with everything I won't let this go
these words are my heart and soul
I'll hold on to this moment you know

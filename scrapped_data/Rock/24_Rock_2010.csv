Underneath the grass would grow, aiming at the sky

1,A Song About Being Sad (ver 2),Rex Orange County,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/rex-orange-county/a-song-about-being-sad-chords-2336419,"Always felt like I needed to please her, or impress her
Though only in the hope that one day I would undress her
    Don't be offended
You think I'm 'bout to tell you that ""I love you""
But I really really really fucking don't
See the months of obsession
And crying for hours
I even started sitting down in the shower, girl
I'll take my time on my own
And I'll be fine now I'm alone
Constantly told stories with a stretch of the truth
Trying hard to make memories to remember from youth
Desperately wanting you to be interested too
It's not clear what I need yet
But it's clear it's not you
Here's what I'd say to any young man that's still interested in you
Do you prioritise the things in your life
The things that you hope to do
  Cause if not then
Mate you'd better trust me when I tell you that
It's not worth forgetting about yourself
She may seem perfect, and gorgeous, and lovely
You'll think she likes you
I mean I thought she loved me, no
But no
Neither of us will get down from the shelf
The only one she loves is herself

but tell em If I dont survive

Free, like a river raging
Strong, is the wind Im facing.
Chasing dreams and racing father time.
Deep like the grandest canyon,
Wild like an untamed stallion.
If you cant see my heart you must be blind.
You can knock me down and watch me bleed
But you cant keep no chains on me.
Deep into my eyes.
I was born free!

Ohhh hoooo
Calm facing danger
Lost, like an unknown stranger
Grateful for my time with no regrets.
Close to my destination
Tired, frail and aching
Waitin patiently for the sun to set.
And when its done believe that I will yell it from that mountain highhh!
And I will vow to the shining seas and celebrate Gods Grace on me.

We had some fun changing
Sometimes I wonder if she'll be the one

Some of us went home
Some of us don't got one
So we'll build one of our own
Friends behind the fences
Looking at me strange
Wondering when I'm gonna come to my senses but i'm still changing
And I can't change my ways
I see the sky changing
Reminds me of my changing
Wish I could tie me a rope around the sun
cause I am not done changing
Times been talking to me
Whispering in my ear
Said follow your heart till it tears your apart
But hearts keep changing
I am not done changing
Out on the run changing
I may be old and I may be young
But I am not done changing

I never took my true heart I never wrote it down
So when the lights cut out
I was lost standing in the wilderness downtown

How we used to wait for letters to arrive

Is how something so small can keep you alive

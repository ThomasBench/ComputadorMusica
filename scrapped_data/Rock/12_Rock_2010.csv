i hvert fall hvis du tør a spør han
Eg pleier å sette på ei plate som du for meg sang
heilt til eg sovna i ditt fang
Før såg eg ingenting og det eg såg forsvant
men nå ser eg alt det som du ser
På min finger har eg ringen din, på ringen står det blankt
at du er min hjerteknuser
Lurer på om du fins der ute nå
send' eg mine tanker kjenner du de då?
Send meg et hint så skal du få.
Sjøl om han forteller lite og minnene er få
fins ting han aldri kan ta meg ifrå
som då me sprang øve plantasjen, eg gjemte meg i strå
du telte til hundre, eg vett at du såg
Lurer på om du fins der ute nå
send' eg mine tanker kjenner du de då?
Send meg et hint så skal du få.
Eg vanner mine planter og pleier det eg sår
sekundene tikker, minuttene går
Og det går dager, og det går år
den som lever får sjå
kanskje du ikkje fins lenger, kanskje det er håp?
kanskje du ikkje tenker på meg heller?
men eg venter på den dagen at me er ute og går
du bøyer deg ner og eg står på tå
Lurer på om du fins der ute nå
send' eg mine tanker kjenner du de då?
Send meg et hint så skal du få.
Eg vanner mine planter og pleier det eg sår
sekundene tikker, minuttene går

Stuck in motion, and the wheels keep spinning 'round
Moving in reverse with no way out

Two steps far from you

That's the time it would take to fix my heart

But I've done pretty good, with a job and a wife
Got a family that loves me and a good piece of land
That I bought with hard work, that I earned with these hands
I do them for you...
So just tell me you love me and tell me you'll stay
And you'll watch over this house while I go away
And just promise to be here when I get back home
So we can start where we left off all those years ago
Before my demons, they took control
Lost and lonely, out here on the road
Well I'm careless and selfish, got no self-respect
I'm an albatross hangin' around my own neck
I'm a hard one to handle and I play the fool
And I'm so hard to love 'cause I break all the rules
These things that I do
'Cause I couldn't have you...
So just tell me you love me and tell me you'll stay
And you'll watch over this house while I go away
And just promise to be here when I get back home

   I know you never meant to put him down

were cutting like knives in a fist fight
And I found you with a bottle of wine
your head in the curtains and heart like the 4th of July
You swore and said we are not
we are not shining stars
This i know
cause i never said we are
Though I've never been through hell like that
I've closed enough windows to know you can never look back
If you're lost and alone, or you're sinkin like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
Carry on carry on
So I met up with some friends at the edge of the night
at a bar off 75
And we talked and talked about how our parents will die
All our neighbors and wives
But i'd like to think
I can cheat it all
to make up for the times i've been cheated on
And it's nice to know
when i was left for dead
I was found and I know not these streets
I am not the ghost you want to be
If you're lost and alone, or you're sinkin like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground
Carry on
ohhhhhhhhhhhhh
My head is on fire, but my legs they're fine
Cause after all, they are mine     
Lay your clothes down on the floor, close the door, hold the phone
show me how, no one's ever gonna stop us now
Cause we are, we are shining stars
We are invincible, we are who we are
On our darkest day, when we're miles away
Sun will come, we will find our way home
If you're lost and alone, or you're sinkin like a stone
Carry on
May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground

As vivid as it truly is,
Fall in love in a single touch,
And fall apart when it hurts too much?
Can we skip past near-death clichés
Where my heart restarts, as my life replays?

Before something breaks that cannot be fixed.
I know, I know - the sirens sound
Just before the walls come down.
Pain is a well-intentioned weatherman
Predicting God as best he can,
But God I want to feel again.
Rain or shine, I don’t feel a thing,
Just some information upon my skin.
I miss the subtle aches when the weather changed,
The barometric pressure we always blamed.
All I want is to flip a switch
Before something breaks that cannot be fixed.
Invisible machinery,
These moving parts inside of me
Well, they’ve been shutting down for quite some time,
Leaving only rust behind.

Just before the walls come down.
Pain is a well-intentioned weatherman
Predicting God as best he can,
But God I want to feel again.
Oh God I want to feel again.

Thought the fresh air would pick me up
Up up and away from the ground
But there’s no talking dog up here
Blowing up balloons with my dear
Hoped maybe I’d see a familiar face on my way
Passed by some cannabis seeds, it all smells exactly the same
I saw a girl in my dreams but I don’t remember her name
I guess it’s just another one of those days when I’m missing everything
   Carousel round and round
Like a kid’s toy you wind me up
And I’ve got nothing to say
So you just throw me in the dump truck
Hoping round the corner I’ll see her
Passed that kid from chemistry who made fun of my name
He didn’t look very happy, I guess we all turn out the same
I saw a girl in my dreams, she kissed me on the face
I guess it’s just another one of those days when I’m missing everything
  When she shows up she can sit on my shoulders
  Cause I’m so strong, I wish
Piggy back ride to the hill, then we roll down
Feeling like kids for the rest of our lives
        Hoping in the morning I'll meet her
  But for now I'll just be lonely, and my arms will feel so bare
Dreaming 'bout her body round me, with my fingers in her hair
It might be so easy, but I am just too scared
Cause I saw a girl in my dreams, but she doesn't like me

Could you hold me without any talking?

And you're kissing to cut through the gloom
With a cough drop coloured tongue
You were sitting in the corner with the coats all piled high
And I thought you might be mine
In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night
In the right place and time
When the zeros line up on the twenty four hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks
   Well, you cured my January blues,
yeah, you made it all alright
I got a feeling I might've lit the very fuse
that you were trying not to light
You were a stranger in my phonebook I was acting like I knew
Cause I had nothing to lose
When the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't coming true
Ain't it funny what you'll do?
When the zeros line up on the twenty four hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks
In late afternoon, the ghost in your room
That you always thought didn't approve of you knocking boots
Never stopped you letting me get hold of the sweet spot
By the scruff of your  knee socks
You and me could've been a team
When the zeros line up on the twenty four hour clock

When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste

And I'll be yours completely, for better or for worse
I know, we'll have our disagreements
Be fighting for no reason, I wouldn't change it for the world
Cause I knew, the first day that I met you
I was never gonna let you, let you slip away
And I still remember feeling nervous
Trying to find the words to get you here today
   You make my heart feel like it's summer
   When the rain is pouring down
   You make my whole world feel so right when it's wrong
   That's how I know that you are the one
   That's why I know you are the one
Oooooooh ooooooooh
In life, it's easy to be scared of
With you I am prepared for what has yet to come
Cause our two hearts will make it easy
Joining up the pieces, together making one
   You make my heart feel like it's summer
   When the rain is pouring down
   You make my whole world feel so right when it's wrong
   That's how I know that you are the one
   That's why I know you are the one
When we are together you make me feel like my mind is free
And my dreams are reachable (oh-oh-oh-oh)
You know I never ever believed in love or believed one day
That you would come along (oh-oh-oh-oh)
And free me
   You make my heart feel like it's summer
   When the rain is pouring down
   You make my whole world feel so right when it's wrong
   That's how I know that you are the one
   That's why I know you are the one
   That's why I know you are the one

 If you need help, if you need help
 I'll shut down the city lights
 To make you well, to make you well
 When enemies are at your door
 If you need help, if you need help
 Your hope dangling by a string
 To make you well, to make you well
 Give me reasons to believe
 That you would do the same for me
 And I would do it for yooooouuuu, for yooooouuuuuu
 Baby I'm not moving on
 I'll love you long after you're gone
 For yooooouuuuu, for yoooooouuuuu
 You would never sleep alone
 I'll love you long after you're gone
 And long after you're gone gone gone
 When you fall like a statue
 Put you on your feet, put you on your feet
 And if your well is empty
 Tell me what you need, what do you need
 I surrender honestly
 You've always done the same for me
 So I would do it for yooooouuuu, for yooooouuuuuu

 I'll love you long after you're gone
 For yooooouuuuu, for yoooooouuuuu
 You would never sleep alone
 I'll love you long after you're gone
 And long after you're gone gone gone
 You're my back bone, you're me cornerstone
 You're my crutch when my legs stop moving
 You're my headstart, you're my rugged heart
 You're the pokes that I've always needed

 Like a drum baby don't stop beating
 Like a drum baby don't stop beating
 Like a drum my heart never stops beating
 for yooooouuuu, for yooooouuuuuu

Gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree
I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see...
And be what I want to be
When I think more than I want to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more than I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you...
Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
Listen to me... I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she coming to me nearly here?
Lilac wine is sweet and heady, where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love
Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
Isnt that she, or am I just going crazy, dear?
Lilac wine, I feel unready, for my love
I feel unready       for my love...

Said I ought to stick to another man

I think you do
So I cry I pray and I beg

Spent my nights awake and I wonder
What I could have done in another way

I will end up lost in confusion

And dance round the room to accordion keys
With the needle that sings in your heart

With pulleys and weights
Creating a radio played just for two
In the parlor with a moon across her face

Silver speakers that sparkle all day
Made for his lover who's floating and choking with her hands across her face

11,Lover You Shouldve Come Over (ver 4),Jeff Buckley,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jeff-buckley/lover-you-shouldve-come-over-chords-1418998,"Looking out the door I see the rain fall upon the
 funeral             mourners
Parading in a wake of sad relations As their shoes
 fill up with     water
               And maybe I'm too young
To keep good love     from going      wrong
But tonight, you're on my mind   so
              You'll never know
I'm broken down and hungry for your love With no
        way to         feed it
Where are you tonight?
Child you know how       much I        need it.
         Too young to hold on
And too old to just     break free and run
      Sometimes a man gets           carried away,
When he feels like he should be      having his      fun
And much too blind to see the damage he's done
Sometimes a man must awake to find that, really,
He has    no-one...
      So I'll wait for you...                  And I'll burn
      Oh will I ever see your sweet return?
      Oh, will I ever learn?
      Oh,         oh,             oh, lover,
   you            should've         come          over
'Cause it's not too late.
Lonely is the room, the bed is made
The open window lets the             rain in
Bu-urning in the corner is the only one
who dreams he had you with him
          My body       turns and yearns for a sleep
That won't ever       come
      It's never over,  My kingdom for a  kiss
 upon her      shoulder
It's never      over,   all my riches for her smiles
When I slept so soft against her...
It's never over,
All my blood for the sweetness of her     laughter
It's never over, she's the tear
That hangs inside my soul forever
           Maybe I'm just too young
To keep good love     from going    wrong
Oh....                 oh....           Ohh.....          Oh.....
             Oh.......            Oh.           Oh........
    Lover            you            should've       come        over...         Yeah yeah yes I..
 feel too young to hold on
I'm much too hold to break free and run
Too deaf, dumb and blind To see the damage I've    done
Sweeeeet looover,                    you should've          come      over
Oh, I would've    waited for you.
(ad lib.) Lover, lover lover         lover love love       lover love love

Michael, they have taken you away
For you stole Trevelyan's corn so the young might see the morn'
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay
Low lie the fields of Athenry

Our love was on the wing
We had dreams and songs to sing
It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry
By a lonely prison wall, I heard a young man calling
Nothing matters, Mary, when you're free
Against the famine and the crown, I rebelled, they cut me down
Now you must raise our child with dignity
Low lie the fields of Athenry

Our love was on the wing
We had dreams and songs to sing
It's so lonely round the fields of Athenry
By a lonely harbor wall, she watched the last star falling
As the prison ship sailed out against the sky
For she'd live in hope and pray for her love in Botany Bay

Told me when I was young
Son, your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore it's done
The brightest flame burns quickest
Is what I heard her say
A son's heart sewed to mother
But I must find my way
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still
Rebel my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
Left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still
Mama, now I'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
A mother's love for her son
Spoken, help me be
Well, I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me
I need your arms to welcome me
But, a cold stone's all I see
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or let this heart be still
Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you
But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still

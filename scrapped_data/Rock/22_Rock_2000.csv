I can hardly remember the last time I felt like I do. 
You're an angel disguised.
And you're lying real still, 
but your heart beat is fast just like mine. 
And the movie's long over, 
that's three that have passed, one more's fine.
Will you stay awake for me? 
I don't wanna miss anything 
I don't wanna miss anything 
I will share the air I breathe,
I'll give you my heart on a string,
I just don't wanna miss anything.
I'm trying real hard not to shake. I'm biting my tongue,
but I'm feeling alive and with every breathe that I take,
I feel like I've won. You're my key to survival.
And if it's a hero you want,
I can save you. Just stay here.
Your whispers are priceless.
Your presence is dear. So please stay near.
Will you stay awake for me? 
I don't wanna miss anything 
I don't wanna miss anything 
I will share the air I breathe,
I'll give you my heart on a string,
I just don't wanna miss anything.
Say my name. I just want to hear you. 
Say my name. So I know it's true. 
You're changing me. You're changing me. 
You showed me how to live. 
So just say. 
So just say
Will you stay awake for me? 
I don't wanna miss anything 
I don't wanna miss anything 
I will share the air I breathe,
I'll give you my heart on a string,
I just don't wanna miss anything.

making the promises never for real
As long as she stands there waiting
Wearin' the holes in the soles of her shoes
How many days disappear
You look in the mirror, so how do you choose
Your clothes never wear as well the next day
and your hair never falls in quite the same way,
you never seem to run out of things to say

who cried a river and drowned the whole world
and while she looks so sad in photographs,

just to put up with this everyday and all day
How did we wind up this way,
watching our mouths for the words that we say
As long as we stand here waiting
wearing the clothes of the souls that we choose
How do we get there today
When we're walking too far for the price of our shoes

and your hair never falls in quite the same way,

People are staring, time to come quick in (?)
Cheeks are on fire; just choose something, something, something

Next minute I am turning out of the door, facing one week without food
A day, a day when things are pretty bad

Can't let your cold heart be free

   How did our eyes get so red, and what the hell is on joeys head.
   And this is where I grew up, I think the present owner fixed it up,
  I never knew we ever went without,the second floor is high for sneakin out
and this is where I went to school, most of the time had better things to do
Criminal record says I broke in twice, I must have done half a dozen times
     I wander if it's too late, should I go back and try to graduate,
Life's better now than it was back then, if I was them I would'nt let me in!
Oh Oh Oh... Oh God I!
 Every memory of lookin out the back door, I had the photo album spread 
out on my bedroom floor, It's hard to say it, time to say it, Good-bye! 
 Every memory of walkin out the front door, I found the photo of the friend 
that I was looking for, It's hard to say it, time to say it, Good-Bye! Good-
 We used to listen to the radio, and sing along to every song we'd know,
 We said someday we'd find out how it feels, to sing to more than just the 
 steering wheel.
 Kim's the first girl I kissed, I was so nervous that I nearly missed,
 She's had a couple of kids since then, I haven't seen her since god knows  
 when!  Oh Oh Oh... Oh God I!
 Every memory of lookin out the back door, I had the photo album spread 
out on my bedroom floor, It's hard to say it, time to say it, Good-bye! 
 Every memory of walkin out the front door, I found the photo of the friend 
that I was looking for, It's hard to say it, time to say it, Good-Bye! Good-
         I miss that town, I can't beleive it, So hard to stay, so hard to 
         leave it!
        If I could Relive those days, I know the one thing that would never 
        change...

   Everytime I do it makes me...

And slowly finished laughing
in the glow of our headlights

The days have come and gone
Our lives went by so fast
I faintly remember breathing
on your bedroom floor
where I layed and told you
but you swore you loved me more
Do you care if I don't
know what to say
Will you sleep tonight?
Will you think of me?
Will I shake this off
pretend it's all OK?
That there's someone out
there who feels just
Those notes you wrote me
I've kept them all
I've given a lot of thought of how
to write you back this fall
With every single letter
in every single word
There will be a hidden message
about a boy that loves a girl

Födda ur hav och himmel står vi kvar, för vi glömmer aldrig denna stad
Vi såg hur du haltade, vi såg hur du sprang
Med tårar på kinden och hjärtat i brand
Med längtan i bröstet, du stod där och sa:

Through empty playground, this ghost's town
Children again on rusting swings getting higher
Sharing a dream
On an Island.... it felt right
We lay side by side,
Between the moon and the tide
Mapping the stars for a while
Let the night surround you
We're half way to the stars,
Ebb and flow
Let it go, feel her warmth beside you
Remember that night,
The warmth and the laughter
Candles burn...
Though the church was deserted
At dawn we went down through empty streets to the harbour
Dreamers may leave, but theye're here everafter...
Da da da da da....

Collecting unemployment checks

On your birth certificate
So strike the fucking match to light this fuse

And he don't even know that you exist
Standing still when it's do or die
You better run for your fucking life

Burning like a flame behind my eyes

Prisoner, a slave to the disguise
Disappear the only thing
Bittersweet surrendering
Knew that it was time to say goodbye

49,The Gift (ver 2),Seether,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/seether/the-gift-chords-826738,"Hold me now I need to feel relief
Like I never wanted anything
I suppose I'll let this go and find a reason I'll hold on to
I'm so ashamed of defeat
And I'm out of reason to believe in me
I'm out of trying to get by
I'm so afraid of the gift you give me
I don't belong here and I'm not well
I'm so ashamed of the lie I'm living
I'm right on the wrong side of it all
I can't face myself when I wake up
And look inside a mirror
I'm so ashamed of that thing
I suppose I'll let it go
'till I have something more to say for me
I'm so afraid of defeat
And I'm out of reason to believe in me
I'm out of trying to defy
I'm so afraid of the gift you give me
I don't belong here and I'm not well
I'm so ashamed of the lie I'm living
I'm right on the wrong side of it all
Hold me now I need to feel complete
Like I matter to the one I need
I'm so afraid of the gift you give me
I don't belong here and I'm not well
I'm so ashamed of the lie I'm living
I'm right on the wrong side of it all

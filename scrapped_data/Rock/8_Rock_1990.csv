0,You Are Not Alone,Michael Jackson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/michael-jackson/you-are-not-alone-chords-657042,"Another day has gone, I'm still all alone,
How could this be? You're not here with me.
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why,
Did you have to go, and leave my world so cold?
Everyday I sit and ask myself : How did love slip away ?
Something whispers in my ear and says that...
You are not alone, for I am here with you.
Though you're far away, I am here to stay.
But you are not alone, for I am here with you,
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart,
But you are not alone.
No...
'Lone, why?
'Lone...
Just the other night I thought I heard you cry,
Asking me to come, and hold you in my arms.
I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear,
But first I need your hand, then forever can begin.
Everyday I sit and ask myself : How did love slip away ?
Something whispers in my ear and says that...
You are not alone, for I am here with you.
Though you're far away, I am here to stay.
But you are not alone, for I am here with you,
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart,
You are not alone, for I am here with you.
Though you're far away, I am here to stay.
But you are not alone, for I am here with you,
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart,
But you are not alone.
No...
'Lone, why?
'Lone...
But you are not alone, for I am here with you.
Though you're far away, I am here to stay.
But you are not alone, for I am here with you,
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart,
But you are not alone.

 Down to Gorky Park,
 Listening to the wind of change...
 An August summer night,
 Soldiers passing by,
 Listening to the wind of change...
 The world is closing in,
 Did you ever think,
 That we could be so close, like brothers?
 The future's in the air,
 I can feel it everywhere,
 Blowing with the wind of change...
    Take me to the magic of the moment
    On a glory night
    Where the children of tomorrow
    Dream away
    In the wind of change
 Walking down the street
 Distant memories
 Are buried in the past forever

 Into the face of time
 Like a stormwind that will ring
 The freedom bell for peace of mind
 Let your balalaika sing
 What my guitar wants to say

Has been found in the strangest places
Feels a lot like love
That I feel for you

I could live with being poor

Sit down next to me

     Into one....Into one.

     To see my world below.
     And I laugh at myself
     While the tears roll down.

Where the crowds will cheer, when they see my face
And a voice keeps saying, this is where I’m meant to be
I’ll be there someday, I can go the distance
I will find my way, if I can be strong
I know every mile, will be worth my while
When I go the distance, I’ll be right where I belong
Down an unknown road, to embrace my fate
Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you
And a thousand years, would be worth the wait
It might take a lifetime, but somehow I’ll see it through
And I won’t look back, I can go the distance
And I’ll stay on track, no, I won’t accept defeat
It’s an uphill slope, but I won’t lose hope
Till I go the distance, and my journey is complete
But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero’s strength is measured by his heart
Like a shooting star, I will go the distance
I will search the world, I will face its’ harms
I don’t care how far, I can go the distance
Till I find my hero’s welcome, waiting in your arms
I will search the world, I will face it’s harms

 But I found out the hard way, there's a pri___ce you have to pay.
 I found out that that love,     was no friend of mine.
 I should have known, time after time.
 So long, it was so long ago, but I've still got the blues for you.
 Used to be so easy,       to fall in love again.
 But I found out the hard way, it's a ro___ad that leads to pain.
 I found that love,       was more than just a game.
 You’re playin’ to win, but you lose just the same.
 So long, it was so long ago, but I've still got the blues for you.
 So many years, since I've seen your  face.
 Here in my heart, there's an em_____pty  space where you used to be.
 So long, it was so long ago, but I've still got the blues for you.
 Though the days come and go, there is one thing I know.
 I've still got the blues for you.

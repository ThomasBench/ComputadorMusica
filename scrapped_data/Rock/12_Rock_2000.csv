We're reeling through an endless fall We are the ever-living ghost of what once was
But no one.. is ever gonna love you more than I do
No one's gonna love you more than I do
And anything to make you smile,  It is a better side.. of you to admire
But they should never take so long, Just to be over them.. back to another one
And no one.. is ever gonna love you more than I do
No one's gonna love you more than I do
But someone, They coulda warned you
When things start splitting at the seams and now
The whole thing's tumbling down
Things start splitting at the seams and now
If things start splitting at the seams and now,
It's tumbling down hard
And anything to make you smile, you are the ever-living ghost of.. what once was
Never want to hear you say, That you’ll be better off.. and you like it that way
And no one.. is ever gonna love you more than I do
No one's gonna love you more than I do
But someone, They shoulda warned you
When things start splitting at the seams and now
The whole thing's tumbling down
Things start splitting at the seams and now
If things start splitting at the seams and now,
It's tumbling down hard

Stompin our feet, on the wooden boards,
Never gotta worry about locking the door

You could say I do at least.

Dream of ways
To make you understand my pain

No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare
If you want more love,
why don't you say so?
If you want more love,
why don't you say so?
Drop his name
Push it in and twist the knife again
Watch my face
As I pretend to feel no pain

Bombs are falling everywhere

Once you want it to begin,
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare.
If you want more love,
why don't you say so?
If you want more love,
why don't you say so?
Just say so...
How come the only way to know how high you get me
is to see how far I fall
God only knows how much I'd love you if you let me
but I can't break through at all.
It's a heartbreak...
I don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight
Let's just fix this whole thing now
I swear to God we're gonna get it right

Red wine and ambien

Just to stumble across another poor old sole,
From the dreary old lanes to the High St madness,
I fight with my brain to believe my eyes
And it's harder than you think to believe this sadness,
It creeps up my spine and haunts me through the night
Life is good, and the girls are gorgeous,
Suddenly the air smells much greener now
And I'm walking around with a half pack of cigarettes
Searching for the change I've lost somehow
These Streets, have too many names for me
I'm used to Glenfield Road and spending my time down in Orchy
I'll get used to this eventually I know, I know
Where'd the days go when all we did was play
And the stress that we were under wasn't stress at all,
Just a run and a jump into a harmless fall
From walking by a high-rise to a landmark square,
You see millions of people with millions of cares
And I stuggle to the train to make my way home
I look at the people as they sit there alone
Life is good and the sun is shining,
Everybody floats to their ideal place
And the children all smile as the boats shuffle by them,
Trying to pretend that they've got some space.

I will not let myself cause my heart so much misery.
  I will not break the way you did, you fell so hard,
  I've learned the hard way to never let it get that far...
Because of you I never stray too far from the sidewalk,
Because of you I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt,
Because of you I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me,
Because of you, I am afraid...
  I lose my way, and it's not too long before you point it out,
I cannot cry, because I know that's weakness in your eyes;
I'm forced to fake, a smile, a laugh, every day of my life.
My heart can't possibly break, when it wasn't even whole to start with...
Because of you I never stray too far from the sidewalk,
because of you I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt,
because of you I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me,
Because of you, I am afraid...
I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your sleep...
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me.
You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain,
and now I cry in the middle of the night, for the same damn thing...
Because of you I never stray too far from the sidewalk,
because of you I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you I try my hardest just to forget everything,
becasue of you I don't know how to let anyone else in.
Because of you I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
because of you, I am, afraid...
Because of you....

The dying man in a living room
Whose shadow paces the floor

Good and evil matched perfect it's a great romance

Vomiting in the kitchen sink
Disconnecting from the missing link

Laying there in that position
There's things you need to hear
So turn off your tears and listen

Love turns the whole thing around
No, it won't all go the way, it should
But I know the heart of life is good
You know it's nothing new
Bad news never had good timing
Then the circle of your friends
Will defend the silver lining

The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
Walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah     Oh Yeah
We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly making me want you
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
So baby drive slow till we run out of road
In this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger seat
you put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it remember it
Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
Yea you stood there with me in the doorway
my hands shake & im not usually this way
But you pull me in & im a little more brave
It's a first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless
  Ohh..  Yeah
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
  Yeah I don't know how
Oh.. oh, yeah, yeah
 You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
 Its the morning of your very first day
 You say hi to your friends you aint seen in a while
 Try and stay out of everybodys way
 It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
 For the next four years in this town
 Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
 You know I haven't seen you around, before
 'Cause when you're fifteen and
 Somebody tells you they love you
 You're gonna believe them
 And when you're fifteen
 Feeling like there's nothing to figure out
 Well count to ten, take it in
 This is life before you know who you're gonna be
 At fifteen
 You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
 And soon enough you're best friends
 Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
 We'll be out of here as soon as we can
 And then you're on your very first date
 And he's got a car and you're feeling like flying
 And you're momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
 And you're dancing round your room when the night ends
 When the night ends
 'Cause when you're fifteen and
 Somebody tells you they love you
 You're gonna believe them
 And when you're fifteen
 And your first kiss makes your head spin 'round
 But in your life you'll do things greater than
 Dating the boy on the football team
 But I didnt know it at fifteen
 When all you wanted was to be wanted
 Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
 Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
 But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
 And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
 Who changed his mind and we both cried
 'Cause when you're fifteen and
 Somebody tells you they love you
 You're gonna believe them
 And when you're fifteen
 Don't forget to look before you fall
 I've found time can heal most anything
 And you just might find who you're supposed to be
 I didn't know who I was supposed to be
 At fifteen

 La la la la la
 Your very first day, take a deep breath girl
 Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
We were both young when i first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
Im standing there on a balcony of summer air
See the lights, See the party the ball gowns
I see you make your way through the crowd
You say hello
Little did i know
That you were romeo you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
And i was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don't go, and i said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting all theres left to do is run
You'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
Its a love story baby just say yes
So i sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet cause we're dead if they know
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter
and my daddy said stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
and i was begging you please don't go and i said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting all theres left to do is run
You be the prince and i'll be the princess
Its a love story baby just say yes
Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but its real,
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
Its a love story baby just say yes, oh
I got tired of waiting,   wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
Then i met you on the outskirts of town and i said
Romeo save me i've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head, i don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
Marry me Juliet you'll never have to be alone
I love you and thats all I really know
I talked to your dad go pick out a white dress
Its a love story baby just say yes
Oh, oh, yes
We were both young when i first saw you
(mm mm mm)
 Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceivin'
 But I know I saw a light in you
 And as we walked we were talking
 I didn't say half the things I wanted to
 Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
 I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
 Hey Stephen, boy you might have me believin'
 I don't always have to be alone
 Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
 Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
 Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
 Can't help it if there's no one else
 Mm I can't help myself
(mm mm mm)
 Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feelin'
 So I've got some things to say to you
 I've seen it all, so I thought
 But I've never seen no body shine the way you do
 The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
 It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
 Hey Stephen, why are people always leavin'
 I think you and I should stay the same
 Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
 Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
 Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
 Can't help it if there's no one else
 Mm I can't help myself

 They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
 Why aren't you here tonight?
 I'm waiting alone now so come on and come out
 And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
 Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
 Why I should be the one you choose
 All those other girls, well they're beautiful
 But would they write a song for you? Haha
 I can't help it if you look like an angel
 Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
 Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
 Can't help it if there's no one else
 Mm I can't help myself
 If you look like an angel
 Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
 Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
 Can't help it if there's no one else
 Mm I can't help myself, mm myself
 mm mm I can't help myself, I can't help myself, oh oh oh
(mm mm mm)
 Say you're sorry
 That face of an angel
 Comes out just when you need it to
 As I paced back and forth all this time
 'Cause I honestly believed in you
 Holding on
 The days drag on
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you
And your white horse, to come around
 Maybe I was naive,
 Got lost in your eyes
 And never really had a chance
 My mistake I didn't know to be in love
 You had to fight to have the upper hand
 I had so many dreams
 About you and me
 Happy endings, now I know
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you
And your white horse, to come around
 And there you are on your knees
 Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
 Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rearview mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse, to catch me now
 Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
 Try and catch me now
 Oh, it's too late
 To catch me now
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me
Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
Hey whatcha doing with a girl like that
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
Shes cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby
You belong with me, you belong with me
Oh I remember you drivin' to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby
You belong with me, you belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me, you belong with me

'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way

But it's killing me to see you go after all this time
  Mm mm mm, mm mm mm mmm mmm
  Mm mm mm, mm mm mm mmm mmm
Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around
   And we know it's never simple, never easy
   Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know, like the back of my hand
   Breathe   without you, but I have to
   Breathe   without you, but I have to
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I try to swerve
People are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

 How to ruin someones perfect day

 I got no one to believe in
 You ask me for my love then you push me around
 Here's to you and your temper
 Yes, I remember what you said last night
 And I know that you see what you're doing to me
 Tell me why, why, tell me why,  ohh
 I take a step back, let you go
 I told you I'm not bulletproof, now you know
All this time I was wasting,
Hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taking me this long
Baby but I figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again,
But not this time around
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did - before
You're not sorry, no noo no noo
Looking so innocent,
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
Cause it's worked each time before
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did - before
You're not sorry no no ohhh
You're not sorry no no ohhh
You had me falling for you honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did - before
You're not sorry no no ohhh
You're not sorry no no ohhh
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating, intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you, oh
And that's the way I loved you, oh
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you
 I’m five years old
 It’s getting cold
 I’ve got my big coat on
 I hear your laugh
 And look up smiling at you
 I run and run
 Past the pumpkin patch
 And the tractor rides up now
 The sky is gold
 I hug your legs and fall asleep
 On the way home
 I don’t know why all the trees change in the fall
 I know you’re not scared of anything at all
 Don’t know if Snow White’s house is near or far away
 But I know I had the best day with you today
 I’m thirteen now
 And don’t know how my friends
 Could be so mean
 I come home crying
 And you hold me tight
 And grab the keys
 And we drive and drive
 Until we’ve found a town
 Far enough away
 And we talk and window-shop
 Until I’ve forgotten all their names
 I don’t know who I’m gonna talk to now at school
 I know I’m laughing on the car ride home with you
 Don’t know how long it’s gonna take to feel okay
 But I know I had the best day with you today
 I have an excellent father
 His strength is making me stronger
 God smiles on my little brother
 Inside and out he’s better than I am
 I grew up in a pretty house
 And I had space to run
 And I had the best days with you
 There is a video
 I found from back when I was three
 You set up a paint set in the kitchen
 And you’re talking to me
 It’s the edge of princesses and pirate ships
 And the seven dwarves
 Daddy’s smart and you're the prettiest lady
 In the whole wide world
 Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
 I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
 And I love you for giving me your eyes
 Staying back and watching me shine
 And I didn’t know if you knew
 So I’m taking this chance to say
 That I had the best day with you today
 It's just a sad picture,
 The final blow hits you
 Somebody else gets what you wanted again
 You know it's all the same
 Another time and place
 Repeating history, and your getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
It's a revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
We'll sing hallelujah
We'll sing hallelujah, oh
 So we've been outnumbered
 Raided and now cornered
 It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
 We're getting stronger now
 From things they never found
 They might be bigger, but we're faster and never scared
 You can walk away and say we don't need this
 But there's something in your eyes, says we can beat this
Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
It's a revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
We'll sing hallelujah
We'll sing hallelujah
Oh
 Tonight we're standing on our knees
 To fight for what we worked for all these years
 The battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
 Will we stand up champions tonight?
It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up, cause we never gave in
We'll sing hallelujah
We'll sing hallelujah
Hallelujah

When I caught your eye, we caught onto something
I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye
And told me you loved me, were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak, I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened
Please tell me cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel, nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Was I out of line? Did I say something way to honest?
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes, thought I knew you for a minute
Now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel, nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Did you mean it baby?
I don't think so
Oh back up, baby back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby back up
Did you forget everything?
'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Oh I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called

In 'Sixty-One, long brown hair and foolish eyes.
  He looked just like you'd want him to - some kind of slick chrome American prince.
A blue jean serenade, Moon River, what you do to me.
But I don't believe you.
  Saw Cinderella in a party dress but she was looking for a nightgown.
  I saw the devil wrapping up his hands, he's getting ready for the showdown.
  I saw the minute that I turned away, I got my money on a palm tonight.
The change came in disguise of revelation set his soul on fire.
She says she always knew he'd come around.
And the decades disappear like sinking ships that we persevere.
God gives us hope, but we still fear, we don't know, the mind is poison.
  Castles in the sky sit stranded, vandalised.
The drawbridge is closing.
  Saw Cinderella in a party dress but she was looking for a nightgown.
  I saw the devil wrapping up his hands, he's getting ready for the showdown.
  I saw the ending when they turned the page, I threw my money and I ran away.
Straight to the valley of the great divide.
  Out where the dreams all hide,   out where the wind don't blow.
  Out here the good girls die,   and the sky won't snow.
  Out here the bird don't sing,   out here the field don't grow.
  Out here the bell don't ring,   out here the bell don't ring.
        Out here the good girls die.
Now Cinderella don't you go to sleep, it's such a bitter form of refuge.
  Oh don't you know the kingdom's under siege? And everybody needs you.
  Is there still magic in the midnight sun? Or did you leave it back in 'Sixty-One?
In the cadence of a young man's eyes,   and where the dreams roll high.

Can you hear the hum?
Of our song
I hope they get it right
I hope we dance tonight
Before we, get it wrong
And the seasons
But you're the best I've known
I could not be stuck on you
If it weren't true
I was swimming
Til you woke me
is just the start
 it was
Now I see you, til kingdom come
You're the one I want
To see me for all the stupid shit I've done
Soil and six feet under
Kept just like we were
Before you knew you'd know me,  
Blooming up from the ground
3 Rounds and a sound
Like whispering you know me,  And you know me
So this was our song
This was our song
I still see the lights
I can see them
And the criss cross
Of what is true, won't get to us, Cause you know me
I could not give up on you
And the fog of what is right
Won't cover us cause you know me

Du rufst mich an und sagst du weisst nicht mehr
Du weisst nicht mehr was dich berührt

und dich nur noch mehr verwirrt.
Halt dich an mir fest wenn dein Leben dich zerreisst
Halt dich an mir fest wenn du nicht mehr weiter weisst
Ich kann dich verstehn.
Halt dich an mir fest weil das alles ist was bleibt.

Schlaefst die Naechte von mir abgewandt
Bist du einsam neben mir?

Cause it's what we needed to have a good time 
And it was fun fun fun 
When we were drinking 
It was fun fun fun 
When we were drunk 
And it was fun fun fun 
When we were laughing 
It was fun fun fun 
Oh it was fun 
Oh well I look at you and say it's the happiest that I've ever been
And I'll say I no longer feel I have to be James Dean
And she'll say yah well I feel all pretty happy too
And I'm always pretty happy when I'm just kicking back with you 
And there'll be love love love
All through our bodies 
And love love love 
All through our minds 
And there'll be love love love
All over her face 
And love love love 
All over mine 
Although maybe all these moments are just in my head
I'll be thinking about them as I'm lying in bed
And all that I believe might never really come true
But in my mind I'm having a pretty good time with you 
Oh in five years time 
I might not know you 
Five years time 
We might not speak 
Oh in five years time
We might not get along 
In five years time 
You might just prove me wrong 
Oh there'll be love love love 
Wherever you go

48,Almost Lover,A Fine Frenzy,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/a-fine-frenzy/almost-lover-chords-556858,"Your fingertips across my skin 
The palm trees swaying in the wind 
Images 
You sang me Spanish lullabies
The sweetest sadness in your eyes
Clever trick 
Well, I never want to see you unhappy
I thought you'd want the same for me 
 Goodbye, my almost lover 
 Goodbye, my hopeless dream 
 I'm trying not to think about you 
 Can't you just let me be? 
 So long, my luckless romance
 My back is turned on you 
 Should've known you'd bring me heartache
 Almost lovers always do 
  We walked along a crowded street 
You took my hand and danced with me 
Images 
And when you left, you kissed my lips 
You told me you would never, never forget
These images, no
Well, I'd never want to see you unhappy 
I thought you'd want the same for me 
 Goodbye, my almost lover 
 Goodbye, my hopeless dream 
 I'm trying not to think about you 
 Can't you just let me be? 
 So long, my luckless romance
 My back is turned on you 
 Should've known you'd bring me heartache
 Almost lovers always do 
 I cannot go to the ocean
I cannot drive the streets at night
I cannot wake up in the morning 
Without you on my mind 
Well so you're gone and I'm haunted 
And I bet you are just fine 
Did I make it that 
Easy to walk right in and out 
Of my life? 
 Goodbye, my almost lover 
 Goodbye, my hopeless dream 
 I'm trying not to think about you 
 Can't you just let me be? 
 So long, my luckless romance
 My back is turned on you 
 Should've known you'd bring me heartache
 Almost lovers always do

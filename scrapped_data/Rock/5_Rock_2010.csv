Rolling down the windows, baby, I can't hear a thing you say
I'm walking back to my favorite place
And I can feel them staring at me
Baby, do you think I'm doing something wrong?
And you got a lot on your mind
And your heart, it looks just like mine
There's no use in wasting your time, anymore
I'm sorry I haven't been myself
And something's got me down
What it is, I cannot tell
I won't be satisfied with anything I've earned
Fear is just a part of love
And one thing I found
Driving home and call my father on the telephone
I hope you know I missed you, man
Let's put it all behind us if we can
Never feeling like I'm all the way home (all the way home)
Stones inside my raincoat pocket I gotta keep
And you got a lot on your mind
And your heart, it looks just like mine
There's no use in wasting your time, anymore
I'm sorry I haven't been myself
And something's got me down
What it is, I cannot tell
I won't be satisfied with anything I've earned
Fear is just a part of love
And one thing I found
I'm sorry I haven't been myself
And something's got me down
What it is, I cannot tell
I won't be terrified with anything I've earned
Fear is just a part of love
And one thing I found

3,Lemon Boy (ver 4),cavetown,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/cavetown/lemon-boy-chords-2304331,"There once was a bitter sweet man and they called him Lemon Boy.
He was growing in my garden and I pulled him out by his hair, like a weed.
And like weeds do he only came and grew back again.
So I figured this time I might as well let him be.
Lemon Boy and me started to get along, together.
I helped him plant his seeds, and we mow the lawn, in bad weather.
It's actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him.
So I got myself a citrus friend.
But soon his bitter sweet started to rub off on me.
You'd think smelling like lemon zest would be pretty neat.
I found out that my friends were more of the savory type,
and they weren't too keen on compromising with a
nice lemon pie.
So, Lemon Boy and me, we just gotta get along, together.
I helped him plant his seeds, and we mow the lawn, in bad weather.
It's actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him.
So I got myself a citrus friend.
But what if I run out of fertilizer?
What if the clouds run out of rain?
What if lemon boy won't grow no longer?
What if beaches dry of sugar cane?
Oh, well.
The whales start to beach themselves.
Tortoise shells tear away from their spines.
It happens all the time, it happens all the time.
(Ooo...)
Lemon Boy and I, we're gonna live, forever.
(Like Snufkin and Little My, we'll get around, wherever.)
Lemon Boy and I, we're gonna live, forever.

Yeah, we're the bitterest guys around.
So I got myself a citrus friend.

So I figured this time I might as well let him be
Lemon Boy and me started to get along together
I helped him plant his seeds and we'd mow the lawn in bad weather
It's actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him
So I got myself a citrus friend
But soon his bitter-sweet started to rub off on me
You'd think smelling like lemon zest would be pretty neat
I found out that my friends were more of the savory type
And they weren't too keen with compromising with a nice lemon pie
So Lemon Boy and me, we just gotta get along together
I helped him plant his seeds and we mowed the lawn in bad weather

What if the clouds run out of rain?
What if Lemon Boy won't grow no longer?
What if beaches dry of sugar cane? Oh-oh well,

Tortoise shells tear away from their spines

Inside my telescope I see
A pair of eyes peer back at me
He walks and talks and looks like me
Sits around inside his house
From room to room he moves about
Fills his life with pointless things
And wonders how it all turns out.
Do do do do   do
Do do do do   do
It's safe to say that
I don't think you understand!
There's nowhere left to turn
Walls keep breaking
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well spent
Or time I've wasted, don't waste it.
Afraid of what the truth might bring
He locks his doors and never leaves
Desperately searching for signs
Too terrified, to find a thing
He battens all the hatches down
And wonders why he hears no sounds
Frantically searching his dreams
He wonders what it's all about
Do do do do   do
Do do do do   do
It's safe to say that
I don't think you understand!
There's nowhere left to turn
Walls keep breaking
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well spent
or time I've wasted.
Here in my mind, losing my friends
Fall on my face do it again.
You say how, do, you do.
  Man, how 'bout you? Man, how 'bout you?
  To be free, to be sold
  To be killed, to be saved
  In my head, I'm alone
  I'm not dead, I'm ashamed
  Just like you, I've been tryin'
  To escape, in my bones
  I feel cold, I give thanks
  To the lord, industry
  In this street, let me go
  Let me be, I don't need
  To be here, I'm alone
  Can't you see? Can't you see?
I don't think you understand!
There's nowhere left to turn
Walls keep breaking
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well spent
or time I've wasted, don't waste it.

I would do anything for love

But I'll never forget the way you feel right now
Oh no - no way
   I would do anything for love (Repeat three times)
   I would do anything for love
   I would do anything for love   
   But I won't do that
   No I won't do that
And some days it don't come easy
and some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all and 
these are the days that never end
And some nights you're breathing fire and
some days you're carved in ice
Some days you're like nothing I've ever
seen before or will again
And maybe I'm crazy, oh it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me no one else can save me now but you
As long as the planets are turning,
as long as the stars are burning
As long as your dreams are comong true, you better believe me
That I would do anything for love,
and I'll be there 'till the final act
I would do anything for love, 
and I take a vow and seal a pact
But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way - tonight

   No I won't do that

But I just won't do that ... (repeat xx times)

somedays I pray for soul
Somedays I just pray for the god of
Sex and Drugs and Rock'n'Roll

some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all when I 
watch you dance and the thunder rolls
Maybe I'm lonely and that's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only, the one and only promise I can keep
As long as the wheels are turning, 
as long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true, you better believe it!
That I would do anything for love, 
and you know it's true and that's a fact
I would do anything for love, 
and there never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better than I do it with you,
so long - so long

   I would do anything for love

   No I won't do that
Will you raise me up, will you help me down
Will you get me right out of this godforsaken town
Will you make it all a little less cold
I can do that, I can do that !
Will you hold me sacred, will you hold me tight
Can you colorize my life I'm so sick of black and white
Can you make it all a little less old
I can do that, I can do that !
Will you make me some magic with your own two hands
Can you build an emerald city with this grains of sand
Can you give me something I can take home
I can do that, I can do that !
Will you cater to every fantasy I got, 
will you hose me down with holy water - if I get to hot
Will you take me to places I've never known
I can do that, I can do that !
After a while you forget everything,
it was a brief interlude and a midsummernights fling, 
and you see that it's time to move on
I won't do that, I won't do that !
I know the territory, I've been around
It'll all turn to dust and we'll all fall down
And sooner or later, you'll be screwing around
I won't do that, I won't do that !

I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love

No I won't do that

 Is still burned in the back of your mind
 You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride

Nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had
When you were mine
I'd go back to December,
Turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time
 These days I haven't been sleeping
 Stayin' up playing back myself leaving
 When your birthday passed and I didn't call
 Then I think about summer all the beautiful times
 I watch you laughing from the passenger side
 And realized I loved you in the fall
 And then the cold came the dark days
 When fear crept into my mind
 You gave me all your love and
 All I gave you was goodbye

Probably mindless dreaming

But the fourth one's out
I can tell cause it's a bit darker
Than the last night's bout
I forgot about the drought
Of light bulbs in this house
So I head out
Down a route I think is heading south
But I'm not good with directions
And I hide behind my mouth
I'm a pro at imperfections
And I'm best friends with my doubt
And now that my mind's out
And now I hear it clear and loud
I'm thinking, 'Wow
I probably should've stayed inside my house.'
I found my way
Right time wrong place
As I plead my case
You're the judge, Oh no
Set me free
You're the judge, Oh no

We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
Test of my patience
There's things that we'll never know
You sunshine, you temptress
My hand's at risk, I fold
Crisp trepidation
I'll try to shake this soon
Spreading you open
Is the only way of knowing you
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright
We'll be alright
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright (Alright, alright, alright)
We'll be alright
We'll be alright

46,Somebody That I Used To Know,Gotye,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/gotye/somebody-that-i-used-to-know-chords-1088165,"Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end
Always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
And I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Somebody...       I used to know
Somebody...  That I used to know 
Somebody...       I used to know
Somebody... (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)
       I used to know  
      That I used to know     
       I used to know             
Somebody...

Spirits in my head and they won't go
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't
I've been looking at the stars tonight
And I think oh how I miss that bright sun
I'll be a dreamer till the day I die
But they say oh how the good die young
But we're all strange
and maybe we don't want to change
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go
But the gun still rattles, the gun still rattles ohh
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go
I spend a lot of nights on the run
and I think oh I'm lost and cant be found
I'm just waiting for my day to come
And I think oh I don't want to let you down
'Cause something inside has changed
And maybe we don't want to stay the same
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go
But the gun still rattles, the gun still rattles ohh
But the gun still rattles, the gun still rattles ohh
And I don't want a never ending life
I just want to be alive while I'm here
And I don't want a never ending life
I just want to be alive while I'm here
And I don't want to see another night
Lost inside a lonely life while I'm here

Spirits in my head and they won't go
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Spirits in my head and they won't go

  And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit right to the top
  Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check
I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then
I'll admit, I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
So this is where you fell, and I am left to sell
  the path that heaven runs through miles of clouded hell 
right to the top
  Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain check
I don't ever want to let you down
I don't ever want to leave this town
'Cause after all
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then
I'll admit, I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then 
I'll admit, I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
    This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
to ashes, to ashes...
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then 
I'll admit, I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
It's time to begin, isn't it?

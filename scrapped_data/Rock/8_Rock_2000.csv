    You want the greatest thing
the greatest thing since bread came sliced.

This lightning storm, this tidal wave

and wiped our tears away
stepped in and saved the day.
But once again, I say amen 
and it's still raining 
as the thunder rolls 
I barely hear You whisper through the rain, 
""I'm with you""
and as Your mercy falls 
I raise my hands and praise 
the God who gives and takes away. 
And I'll praise you in this storm 
and I will lift my hands 
for You are who You are 
no matter where I am 
and every tear I've cried 
You hold in your hand 
You never left my side 
and though my heart is to-rn 
I will praise You in this storm 
I remember when I stumbled in the wind 
You heard my cry to You
and raised me up again 
my strength is almost gone how can I carry on 
if I can't find You 
and as the thunder rolls 
I barely hear You whisper through the rain 
""I'm with you""
and as Your mercy falls 
I raise my hands and praise

und er trägt deinen Namen.
So wunderschön und wertvoll,
mit keinem Geld der Welt zu zahlen.
Du schläfst neben mir ein,
ich könnt dich die ganze Nacht betrachten,
sehn wie du schläfst,
hörn wie du atmest,
bis wir am morgen erwachen.
Du hast es wieder mal geschafft,
mir den Atem zu rauben,
wenn du neben mir liegst,
dann kann ich es kaum glauben,
dass jemand wie ich,
so was schönes wie dich verdient hat.
Du bist das Beste was mir je passiert ist,
es tut so gut wie du mich liebst!
Vergess den Rest der Welt,
wenn du bei mir bist!
Du bist das Beste was mir je passiert ist,
es tut so gut wie du mich liebst!
Ich sag’s dir viel zu selten,
es ist schön, dass es dich gibt!
Dein Lachen macht süchtig,
fast so als wär es nicht von dieser Erde.
Auch wenn deine Nähe Gift wär,
ich würd bei dir sein solange bis ich sterbe.
Dein Verlassen würde Welten zerstörn,
doch daran will ich nicht denken.
Viel zu schön ist es mit dir,
wenn wir uns gegenseitig Liebe schenken.
Betank mich mit Kraft,
nimm mir Zweifel von den Augen,
erzähl mir 1.000 Lügen,
ich würd sie dir alle glauben,
doch ein Zweifel bleibt,
dass ich jemand wie dich verdient hab!
Du bist das Beste was mir je passiert ist,
es tut so gut wie du mich liebst!
Vergess den Rest der Welt,
wenn du bei mir bist!
Du bist das Beste was mir je passiert ist,
es tut so gut wie du mich liebst!
Ich sag’s dir viel zu selten,
es ist schön, dass es dich gibt!
Wenn sich mein Leben überschlägt,
bist du die Ruhe und die Zuflucht,
weil alles was du mir gibst,
einfach so unendlich gut tut.
Wenn ich rastlos bin,
bist du die Reise ohne Ende,
deshalb leg ich meine kleine große Welt
in deine schützenden Hände! („Ahhaha“)
Du bist das Beste was mir je passiert ist,
 tut so gut wie du mich liebst!
Vergess den Rest der Welt,
Du bist das Beste was mir je passiert ist,
es tut so gut wie du mich liebst!

 And let the sun wrap its arms around me
And  bathe my skin in water cool and cleansing
And feel, feel what it’s like to be new

  Where I send my thoughts to far off destinations
So they may have a chance of finding a place
where they’re   far more suited than here

ba-dup, ba-dup  ba-dup bap bahhh-dup buddup bah
  I cannot guess what we’ll discover
  When we turn the dirt with our palms cupped like shovels
But I know our filthy hands can wash one another’s
And not one speck will remain
I do believe it’s true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
But if the silence takes you
Then I hope it takes me too
So brown eyes I hold you near
Cause you’re the only song I want to hear
A melody softly soaring through my atmosphere
Where soul meets body....
Where soul meets body....
Where soul meets body
And I do believe it’s true
That there are roads left in both of our shoes
If the silence takes you
Then I hope it takes me too
So brown eyes I hold you near

Never an honest word

   I've had you so many times but
   somehow I want more

   Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

   It doesn't matter anymore
   It's not always rainbows and butterflies
   It's compromise that moves us along
   My heart is full and my door's always open
   You can come anytime you want
   I don't mind spending everyday
   Out on your corner in the pouring rain
   Look for the girl with the broken smile
   Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
   And she will be loved
   She will be loved
   I know where you hide
   Alone in your car
   Know all of the things that make you who you are
   I know that goodbye means nothing at all
   Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls

The guilt, the pain, the hurt, the shame

I was thinkin''bout ways not to lose
I lay down my weapons is what I've done
Too late to hide, feet too soft to run
But people say I'm the luckiest man
Runnin' is useless and fightin' is foolish
You're not gonna win but still you're the luckiest man you're up against
And too many horses and mysterious forces
What you don't know is you are the luckiest man
You're the luckiest man
I done talked to the devil when he calls my name
But sometimes when I'm losing it all seems the same
And when I fall I'm back up again
Just to slip on the same mistakes and slide right back in
But people say I'm the luckiest man
Running is useless and fighting is foolish
You're not gonna win but still you're the luckiest man you're up against
And too many horses and mysterious forces
What you don't know is you are the luckiest man
You're the luckiest man
Try to keep my faith and keep my mind
Hate to lose either one when the whip cracks behind
And I can't help but mourning just a little each night
People say everything is gonna be alright
But people say I'm the luckiest man
Running is useless and fighting is foolish
You're not gonna win but still you're the luckiest man you're up against

How did our eyes get so red, and what the hell is on Joey's head?
And this is where I grew up, I think the present owner fixed it up,
I never knew we ever went without,the second floor is high for sneakin' out.
And this is where I went to school, most of the time had better things to do,
Criminal record says I broke in twice, I must have done it half a dozen times.
I wonder if it's too late, should I go back and try to graduate,
Life's better now than it was back then, if I was them I wouldn't let me
in...

Good-bye, Good-bye.
Every memory of walkin out the front door, I found the photo of the friend
that I was looking for, It's hard to say it, time to say it
Good-Bye, Good-Bye.
Remember the old arcade? Blew every dollar that we ever made.
The Cops hated us hangin' out, they say somebody went and burned it down.
We use to listen to the radio and sing along with every song we'd know.
We said someday we'd find out how it feels to sing to more than just the
steering wheel.
Kim's the first girl I kissed. I was so nervous that I nearly missed.
She's had a couple of kids since then. I haven't seen her since god knows
when.

I miss that town, I miss their faces
You can't erase, You can't replace it.
I miss it now. I can't believe it.

May all the old words cease to rhyme
If the sky, turned into stone,
It would matter not at all
For there is no heaven, in the sky,
Hell does not wait, for our downfall
Let the voice of reason shine,
Let the pious vanish, for all time,
God's face is hidden, all unseen,
You can't ask him what it all means
He was never on your side,
God was never on your side,
Let right or wrong alone decide
God was never on your side.
See ten thousand ministries,
See the holy righteous dogs
They claim to heal, but all they do is steal,
Abuse your faith, cheat, and rob
If God is wise, why is he still,
When these false prophets, call him friend
Why is he silent, is he blind?
Are we abandoned, in the end?
Let the sword of reason shine,
Let us be free of prayer and shrine
God's face is hidden, turned away,
He never has a word to say
He was never on your side,
God was never on your side
Let right or wrong, alone decide,

47,The Only Exception (ver 10),Paramore,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/paramore/the-only-exception-chords-1203741,"When i was younger i saw my daddy cry and curse at the wind.
He broke his own heart and I watched as he tried to re-assemble it.
And my mamma swore she would never let herself forget.
And that was the day that i promised I'd never sing of love if it does not
exist. But darling..
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
Maybe i know somewhere deep in my soul that love never lasts.
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone or keep a straight face.
And i've always lived like this keeping a comfortable, distance.
And up until now I have swored to myself that I'm content with loneliness,
Because none of it was ever worth the risk.
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
I've got a tight grip on reality, But i can't
let go of what's in front of me here.
I know you're leaving in the morning, when you wake up,
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream.
whoa
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
But you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
And i'm on my way to believing
Oh, And i'm on my way to believing

but there's someone who's torn it apart

The first cut is the deepest, baby I know
The first cut is the deepest

Travel all across this land
Me and you
We'll end up hand in hand
Somewhere down on the sand
Me and you
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be

Free as we'll ever be
Drive until the city lights
Dissolve into a country sky
Me and you
Lay underneath the Georgia moon
Do all the things that lovers do
Just me and you
Just as free
Free as we'll ever be

Free as we'll ever be
No we don't have a lot of money x7

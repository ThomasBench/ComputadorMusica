0,Killer Queen (ver 2),Queen,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/queen/killer-queen-chords-706880,"She keeps Moët et Chandon in her pretty cabinet,
""Let them eat cake"" she says, just like Marie Antoinette.
A built-in remedy for Khrushchev and Kennedy,
At any time an invitation you can't decline.
Caviar and cigarettes, well versed in etiquette,
Extraordinarily nice, she's a
Killer Queen,
Gunpowder, gelatine, dynamite with a laser beam,
Guaranteed to blow your mind, anytime.
Ooh, recommended at the price, insatiable an appetite
     Wanna try?
To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
   In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah
Then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined
Perfume came naturally from Paris (naturally)
For cars, she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise, she's a
Killer Queen,
Gunpowder, gelatine, dynamite with a laser beam,
Guaranteed to blow your mind, anytime.
Drop of a hat, she's as willing as, playful as a pussycat,
Then momentarily out of action,
Temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you
Wi - ild, wi - ild. (She's out to get you) She's a...
Killer Queen,
Gunpowder, gelatine, dynamite with a laser beam,
Guaranteed to blow your mind, anytime.
Ooh, recommended at the price, insatiable an appetite
     Wanna try?

1,Harvest (ver 2),Neil Young,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/neil-young/harvest-chords-1045545,"Did I see you down in a young girl's town,
with your mother in so much pain?
I was almost there at the top of the stairs,
with her screamin' in the rain
Did she wake you up to tell you that,
it was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup,
with the promise of a man.
Did I see you walking with the boys,
though it was not hand in hand?
And was some black face in a lonely place,
when you could understand?
Did she wake you up to tell you that,
it was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup,
with the promise of a man.
Will I see you give more than I can take?
Will I only harvest some?
As the days fly past will we lose our grasp,
or fuse it in the sun?
Did she wake you up to tell you that,
it was only a change of plan?
Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup,
with the promise of a man.

I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It bein' summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt
West Texas cowboys, they's all around
With liquor and money, they're loaded down
So soon after payday, you know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
High-low jack and the winner take the hand
My uncle starts winnin' - cowboys got sore
One of them called him and then two more
Accused him of cheatin' - oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle - he's as honest as me
And I'm as honest as a Denver man can be
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
I shot him down, Lord, he never saw
Shot me a-nother, hot damn, he won't grow old
And in the con-fusion my uncle grabbed the gold
And we high-tailed it down to Mexi-co
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I loved my uncle, God rest his soul
He taught me good, Lord, taught me all I know
Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead-ass there by the side of the road

Two voices call to you from where they stood,

Better keep on movin, Doolin-Dalton
Till your shadow sets you free.
And if you're fast, and if you're lucky,
You will never see that hangin tree.
Well the towns lay out across the dusty plain
Like graveyards filled with tombstones waitin for the names
And a man could use his back or use his brains
But some just went stir-crazy Lord cause nothin ever changed

He was workin cheap, just buyin time

To sit with elders of the gentle race, this world has seldom seen

Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace, whose sounds caress my ear

became the special man, and we were Ziggy's band.
     Ziggy really sang, with screwed up eyes and 
screwed down hairdo like some cat from Japan.
He could lick 'em by smiling, he could leave 'em to hang.

     Just the beer light to guide us. 
And so we bitched about his fans and should we crush his sweet hands.
    Ziggy played for time, jiving us that 
we were voodoo and the kids was just crass.
He was the nazz with God-given ass. 
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar.

Walk out of any doorway
Feel your way, feel your way like the day before

Around some corner where
It's been waiting to meet you
What do you want me to do?
To watch for you while you're sleeeeeeeeping?
Then please don't be surprised when you find me dreaming too.

You find by you, you can see clear to another day
Maybe been seen before through other eyes
On other days while going home
What do you want me to do, to do for you, to see you through?

Walk into splintered sunlight, inch your way through
Dead dreams to another land
Maybe you're tired and broken, your tongue is twisted with
Words half-spoken and thoughts unclear

We used to play for silver, now we play for life;
And one's for sport and one's for blood at the point of a knife.
And now the die is shaken, now the die must fall;
There ain't no winner in the game, he don't go home with all,
Not with all.
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July,
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky.
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe,
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne from sea to shining sea.
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride,
Got to settle one old score, one small point of pride.
Ain't no place a man can hide, Shannon, to keep him from the sun;
Ain't no bed can give us rest, now, you keep us on the run.
Jack Straw from Wichita cut his buddy down,
And dug for him a shallow grave and laid his body down.
Half a mile from Tucson, by the morning light,
One man gone and another to go, my old buddy you're moving much too slow.
We can share the women, we can share the wine.

Together, more or less in line, just keep truckin' on.
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street.
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street.
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings.
Dallas, got a soft machine; Houston, too close to New Orleans;
New York's got the ways and means; but just won't let you be.
Most of the cats that you meet on the streets speak of true love,
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home.
One of these days they know they gotta get goin'
Out of the door and down on the streets all alone.
Truckin', like the do-dah man. Once told me ""You've got to play your hand""
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime, if you don't lay'em down, 
Lately it occurs to me 
what a long, strange trip it's been.
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine,
All a friend can say is ""Ain't it a shame?""
Truckin', up to Buffalo. Been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
Takes time, to pick a place to go, and just keep truckin' on.
Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window.
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel,
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in.
Busted, down on Bourbon Street, Set up, like a bowlin' pin.
Knocked down, it get's to wearin' thin. They just won't let you be.
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel;
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down.
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin',
Get out of the door and light out and look all around.
Lately it occurs to me 
what a long, strange trip it's been.
Truckin', I'm a goin' home. Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong,
Back home, sit down and patch my bones, and get back truckin' on.

Right outside this lazy summer home
You ain’t got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter’s summer home
Wonderin’ where the nut-thatch winter’s wings a mile long
Just carried the bird away
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
But the heart has its beaches, its homelands and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover, that you are the song that morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own
There comes a redeemer and he slowly too fades away
There follows a wagon behind him that’s loaded with clay
And the seeds that were silent all burst into bloom and decay - ay
And night comes so quiet it’s close on the heels of the day
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
But the heart has its beaches, its homelands and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover, that you are the song that morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
But the heart has its beaches, its homelands and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover, that you are the song that morning brings

Someone opened up the closet door and out stepped Johnny B. Goode,
Playing guitar like a ringin' a bell    and lookin'like he should.
If you gotta play at garden parties, I wish you a lotta luck
But if memories were all     I sang,     I'd rather drive a truck.

Warm smell of colitas, Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim, I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself, ""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle, And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place), Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year), You can find it here""
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, She got the Mercedes Benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, She calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, Some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain, ""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since - 1969""
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night, Just to hear them say
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place), Such a lovely face
They living it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), Bring your alibis""
Mirrors on the ceiling, The pink champagne on ice
And she said: ""We are all just prisoners here, Of our own device""
And in the master's chambers, They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives, But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was Running for the door
I had to find the passage back, To the place I was before
""Relax,"" said the night man
""We are programmed to receive, You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave!""

49,Say You Love Me (ver 4),Fleetwood Mac,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/fleetwood-mac/say-you-love-me-chords-1714277,"Have mercy, Baby, on a poor girl like me,
you know I'm falling, falling, falling at your feet
I'm tingling right from my head to my toes,
so help me, help me, help me make the feeling go
Cause when the loving starts and the lights go down, 
and there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up,
and you say, that you love me
Pretty baby, just when I thought it was over
And now you've got me running, running, running for cover
I'm begging you for a little sympathy,
if you use me again it'll be the end of me
Cause when the loving starts and the lights go down, 
and there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up,
and you say, that you love me
Baby Baby, hope you're gonna stay away,
cause I'm getting weaker, weaker every day
I guess I'm not as strong as I used to be,
and if you use me again it will be the end of me
Cause when the loving starts and the lights go down, 
and there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up,
and you say, that you love me
Cause when the loving starts and the lights go down, 
and there's not another living soul around
You woo me until the sun comes up,
and you say, that you love me
Say, that you love me, 
say, that you love me
  Falling, falling, falling (repeat and fade)

  The lot we used to pass by  every day
 Just walk away, Renee
You won't see me follow you back home
 The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same
 You're not to blame
From deep inside the tears that  I'm forced to cry
  From deep inside the pain that  I chose to hide
 Just walk away, Renee
You won't see me follow you back home
 Now, as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes,
 For me, it cries
 Just walk away, Renee
You won't see me follow you back home
 Now, as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes,
 For me, it cries
Your name and mine inside a  heart upon a wall
  Still finds a way to haunt me, though they're so small
 Just walk away, Renee
You won't see me follow you back home
 The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same
 You're not to blame

Pour bercer tes rêves d'enfant
Ensemble on est devenus grand
De bons points en double zéro
Paralysés par tant d'amour
On s'apprivoise au jour le jour
J'n'ai jamais su trouver les gestes
Qui pouvaient soigner tes blessures
Guider tes pas vers le futur
À tous les signaux de détresse
Dis, comment j'aurais pu faire face
Pris entre le feu et la glace
Au-delà de nos différen_en_ences
Des coups de gueule des coups de sang
À force d'échanger nos silen_en_ces
Maintenant qu'on est face à face
On se ressemble sang pour sang
Comme si les battements de nos coeurs
Étaient sûr la même longueur d'onde
Les lignes de nos mains se confondent
Tu me renvoies comme un miroir
Mes doutes et mes éclats de rires
La promesse d'un autre avenir
Peu importe si la vie menace
Ce qui reste en nous d'innocent
Puisqu'on se comprend à présent
Peu à peu la douleur s'efface
On en garde plus qu'une trace
Comme une offense au temps qui passe
Au-delà de nos différen_en_ences
Des coups de gueule des coups de sang
À force d'échanger nos silen_en_ces

On se ressemble sang pour sang
Au-delà de nos différen_en_ences

I am alone, gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow.
I Am A Rock, I am an island.
I've built walls, a fortress steep and mighty,
That none may penetrate. I have no need of friendship;
Friendship causes pain. It's laughter and it's loving I disdain.
I Am A Rock, I am an island.
Don't talk of love, but I've heard the words before;
It's sleeping in my memory. I won't disturb the slumber of feelings
That have died. If I never loved I never would have cried.
I Am A Rock, I am an island.
I have my books, and my poetry to protect me;
I am shielded in my armor, hiding in my room, save within my womb.
I touched no one and no one touches me.
I Am A Rock, I am an island.
And a rock feels no pain;
And an island never cries!

Once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready,
But wonder why the fight is on

Orange is young, full of daring,

In fact I'm trying to say it's frightened like me
And all these emotions of mine keep holding me from,
Giving my life to a rainbow like you

   But now these days are gone, I'm not so self-assured.
   Now I find I've changed my mind, I've opened up the doors.
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down.
And I do appreciate you being 'round.
Help me get my feet back on the ground.
Won't you please, please help me.
   And now my life has changed in oh so many ways.
   My independence seems to vanish in the haze.

Hey, you've got to hide your love away!
How can I,  even try?  I can never win.
Hearing them, seeing them,  in the state I'm in.
How could she say to me, ""Love will find a way""?
Gather 'round all you clowns, let me hear you say.
Hey, you've got to hide your love away!

How was I to know you would upset me?

As she slams the door in his drunken face
And now he stands outside
And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool
He cries oh, girl you must be mad,
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?
Against the door he leans and starts a scene,
And his tears fall and burn the garden green
And so castles made of sand fall in the sea, eventually
A little Indian brave who before he was ten,
Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends
And he built up a dream that when he grew up
He would be a fearless warrior Indian Chief
Many moons past and more the dream grew strong until
Tomorrow he would sing his first war song and fight his first battle
But something went wrong, surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night
And so castles made of sand melts into the sea, eventually
There was a young girl, whose heart was a frown
Cause she was crippled for life,
And she wished and prayed she could stop living,
So she decided to die
She drew her wheelchair to the edge of the shore
And to her legs she smiled you wont hurt me no more
But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
Look a golden winged ship is passing my way
And it really didn't have to stop,            it just kept on going...
And so castles made of sand slips into the sea, eventually

We felt it both at once, the start of our romance.

    Will she smell alone?
    And I feel, so much depends on the weather.
    So is it raining in your

1,Paper Bag (ver 4),Fiona Apple,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/fiona-apple/paper-bag-chords-1034733,"I was staring at the sky, just looking for a star
To pray on, or wish on, or something like that
I was having a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy
Whose reality I knew, was a hopeless to be had
But then the dove of hope began its downward slope
And I believed for a moment that my chances
Were approaching to be grabbed
But as it came down near, so did a weary tear
I thought it was a bird, but it was just a paper bag
Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh it kills
'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up
I got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts, but starving works, when it costs too much to love
And I went crazy again today,
Looking for a strand to climb, looking for a little hope
Baby said he couldn't stay, wouldn't put his lips to mine
And a fail to kiss is a fail to cope
I said, 'Honey, I don't feel so good, don't feel justified
Come on put a little love here in my void,' 
He said?'It's all in your head,' 
and I said, 'So's everything,' but he didn't get it 
I thought he was a man
But he was just a little boy
Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh it kills
'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up
I got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts, but starving works, when it costs too much to love
Hunger hurts, but I want him so bad, oh it kills
'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up
I got to fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts, but starving works, when, when it costs too much to love
Oh, hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh it kills
Because I know I'm a mess that he don't wanna clean up
I got to fold 'cause these hands are just too shaky to hold

You can listen to the engine moanin' out his one long song
You can think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before
But your thoughts will soon be wandering, the way they always do
When you're ridin' sixteen hours and there's nothin' much to do
And you don't feel much like ridin', you just wish the trip was through
Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playin' the star again
There I go.  Turn the page
So you walk into this restaurant, all strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you, as you're shakin' off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode
Yeah, most times you can't hear 'em talk, other times you can
All the same old cliches, is it woman? Is it man?
And you always seem outnumbered, you don't dare make a stand
Here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playin' the star again
There I go.  Turn the page
Out there in the spotlight, you're a million miles away
Every ounce of energy, you try and give away
As the sweat pours out your body, like the music that you play
Later in the evening, as you lie awake in bed
With the echoes of the amplifiers ringin' in your head
You smoke the day's last cigarette, rememberin' what she said

In a bar that faces a giant car wash

On their lunch break, hosing and scrubbing
As best they can in skirts in suits""

And nobody thinks or expects too much
And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights
Singing hey babe let's keep in touch
Hey baby let's keep in touch
But I want more than a touch I want you to reach me
And show me all the things no one else can be
So what you feel becomes mine as well

And there ain't a whole lot that you can do
Oh sure the banner may be torn and wind's gotten colder
  Perhaps I've grown a little cynical
But I know no matter what the waitress brings
I shall drink it and always be full
Yeah I will drink it and always be full
Oh I like coffee, and I like tea
I'd like to be able to enter a final plea
I still got this dream that you just can't shake
I love you to the point you can no longer take
Well all right, okay, so be that way
I hope and pray that there's something left to say
But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around

Where secrets lie in the border fires in the humming wires

On a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man
In a dusty black coat with a red right hand
He'll wrap you in his arms tell you that you've been a good boy
He'll reach deep into the hole heal your shrinking soul
But there won't be a single thing that you can do
They're whispering his name through this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat is a red right hand
You don't have no money he'll get you some
You don't have no self respect you feel like an insect
Well don't you worry buddy 'cause here he comes
A shadow is cast wherever he stands
Stacks of green paper in his red right hand
You'll see him in your nightmares you'll see him in your dreams
  You'll see him in your head on the TV screen
Hey buddy I'm warning you to turn it off
You're one microscopic cog in his catastrophic plan
De-signed and directed by his red right hand

The only girl I've ever loved
Was born with roses in her eyes
But then they buried her alive
One evening nineteen-forty-five
With just her sister at her side
And only weeks before the guns
All came and rained on everyone
Now she's a little boy in Spain
Playing pianos filled with flames
On empty rings around the sun
All sing to say my dream has come
But now we must pick up every piece
Of the life we used to love
Just to keep ourselves
At least enough to carry on
And now we ride the circus wheel
With your dark brother wrapped in white
Says it was good to be alive
But now he rides a comet's flame
And won't be coming back again
The Earth looks better from a star
That's right above from where you are
He didn't mean to make you cry
With sparks that ring and bullets fly
On empty rings around your heart
The world just screams and falls apart
But now we must pick up every piece
Of the life we used to love
Just to keep ourselves
At least enough to carry on
And here's where your mother sleeps
And here is the room where your brothers were born
Indentions in the sheets
Where their bodies once moved but don't move anymore
And it's so sad to see the world agree
That they'd rather see their faces filled with flies
All when I'd want to keep white roses in their eyes

45,Oh Comely,Neutral Milk Hotel,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/neutral-milk-hotel/oh-comely-chords-261688,"    Oh comely
I will be with you when you lose your breath
Chasing the only meaningful memory you thought you had left
With some pretty bright and bubbly terrible scene
That was doing her thing on your chest
But oh comely
It isn't as pretty as you'd like to guess
It doesn't mean anything at all
Oh comely
All of your friends are letting you blow
Bristling and ugly
Bursting with fruits falling out from the holes
Of some pretty bright and bubbly friend
You could need to say comforting things in your ear
But oh comely
There isn't such one friend that you could find here
I'll crush him with everything I own
say what you want to say
and hang for your hollow ways moving your mouth
to pull out all your miracles aimed for me
Your father made fetuses
While you and your mother
Were asleep in the trailer park
Thunderous sparks from the dark of the stadiums
The music and medicine you needed for comforting
So make all your fat fleshy fingers to moving
And pluck all your silly strings
And bend all your notes for me
Soft silly music is meaningful magical
The movements were beautiful
All in your ovaries
All of them milking with green fleshy flowers
While powerful pistons were sugary sweet machines
Smelling of semen all under the garden
Was all you were needing when you still believed in me
Say what you wanna say and hang for your hollow ways
Moving your mouth to pull out all your miracles aimed for me

I know they buried her body with others
Her sister and mother and 500 families
And will she remember me 50 years later
I wished I could save her in some sort of time machine

We know who our enemies are
Know all your enemies
We know who our enemies are

Put on my blue suede shoes,
And I board-ed the plane. 
Touched down in the land of the Delta Blues, 
In the middle of the pouring rain.
W.__C. Handy, won't you look down over me, 
Yeah I got a first class ticket. 
But I'm as blue as a boy can be. 
Then I'm walking in Memphis, 
Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale. 
Walking in Mem—phis, 
But do I really feel the way I feel? 
Saw the ghost of El—vis, 
On Union Ave—nue.
Followed him up to the gates of Grace—land, 
Then I watched him walk right through. 
Now se—curity they did not see him, 
They just hovered 'round his tomb. 
But there's a pretty little thing, 
Wait—ing for the King. 
Down in the Jungle Room,
When I was walking in Mem—phis, 
I was Walking with my feet ten feet off of Beale. 
Walking in Mem—phis 
But do I really feel the way I feel? 
They've got catfish on the table 
They've got gospel in the air 
And Reverend Green__ be glad to see you 
When you haven't got a prayer 
But boy you've got a prayer in Mem—phis 
Now, Muriel plays piano 
Every Friday at the Holly-wood 
And they brought me down to see her 
And they asked me if I would
Do a little num-ber 
And I sang with all my might
And she said, ""Tell me are you a Christian child?"" 
And I said,""Ma'am I am to-night""

Carve your name into my arm
Instead of stressed, I lie here charmed
Cuz there's nothing else to do
Every me and every you

Another love I would abuse
No circumstances could excuse
In the shape of things to come
Too much poison come undone
Cuz there's nothing else to do

Sucker love is known to swing
Prone to cling and waste these things
Pucker up for heavens sake

I serve my head up on a plate
It's only comfort, calling late
Cuz there's nothing else to do
Every me and every you
Every me and every you

Every me and every you

Like the naked leads the blind
I know I'm selfish, I'm unkind
Sucker love I always find
Someone to bruise and leave behind
All alone in space and time

Something borrowed, something blue

Every me and every you

And I'd give up forever to touch you
Cause I know that you feel me somehow
You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now
And all I can taste is this moment
And all I can breathe is your life
When sooner or later it's over
I just don't want to miss you tonight
And I don't want the world to see me
Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am
And you can't fight the tears that ain't comin
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive

0,Electric Love (ver 2),BØRNS,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/1708890,"Candy, she's sweet like candy in my veins
Baby, I'm dying for another taste
And every night my mind is running around her
Thunder's getting louder and louder
Baby you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
And all I need is to be struck by your electric love
Baby your electric love
Electric love
Drown me
You make my heart beat like the rain
Surround me
Hold me deep beneath your waves
And every night my mind is running around her
Thunder's getting louder and louder and louder
Baby you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
And all I need is to be struck by your electric love
Baby your electric love
Electric love
Rushing through me
Feel your energy rushing through me
Feel your energy rushing through me
Baby you're like lightning in a bottle
I can't let you go now that I got it
And all I need is to be struck by your electric love
Baby your electric love
Baby, you're electric

12,Wildest Dreams,Ryan Adams,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ryan-adams/wildest-dreams-chords-1769069," She said let's get out of this town
 Drive out of the city, away from the crowds
 I thought heaven can't help me now
 Nothing lasts forever, this is gonna take me down
 She's so tall, and handsome as hell
 She's so bad but she does it so well
 I can see the end as it begins my one condition is
 Say you'll remember me
 Standing in your nice dress, staring at the sunset
 Red lips and rosy cheeks
 Say you'll see me again even if it's just in
 Your wildest dreams
 Your wildest dreams
 I say no one has to know what we do
 Her hands are in my hair, her clothes are in my room
 And her voice is a familiar sound, nothing lasts forever
 But this is getting good now
 She's so tall, and handsome as hell
 She's so bad but she does it so well
 When we've had our very last kiss
 My last request is
 Say you'll remember me
 Standing in your nice dress, staring at the sunset, baby
 Red lips and rosy cheeks
 Say you'll see me again even if it's just in
 Your wildest dreams
 Your wildest dreams
 You'll see me in hindsight
 Tangled up with you all night
 Burning it down
 Someday when you leave me
 Bet all these memories will follow you around
 Will follow you around
 around      
  oooh..
 Say you'll remember me
 Standing in your nice dress, staring at the sunset, baby
 Red lips and rosy cheeks
 Say you'll see me again even if it's just in
 Your wildest dreams

 She left already or not
 Leather jacket, collar popped like Cantona
 Never knowing when to stop
 Sunglasses indoors, par for the course
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
   Cages and poles
 Call off the search for your soul
Or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke
And she calls the folks who run this her oldest friends
 Sipping a drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going
  Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem
 She's a certified mind blower
 Knowing full well that I don't
 May suggest there's somewhere from which you might know her
 Just to get the ball to roll
 Drunken monologues, confused because
It's not like I'm falling in love
I just want you to do me no good
And you look like you could
  Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem
Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem
Yeah, yeah
 The look of love - the rush of blood
The ""She's with me"" - the Gallic shrug
The shutterbugs - the Camera Plus
The black & white - the colour dodge
The good time girls - the cubicles
The house of fun - the number one       party anthem
  Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

Promise that you'll stay here

With no point of reference
You spoke to the dark, and fleshed out the wonder of light
And as You speak, a hundred billion galaxies are born
In the vapor of Your breath the planets form
If the stars were made to worship, so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've made
Every burning star, a signal fire of grace
If creation sings Your praises, so will I
God of Your promise, You don't speak in vain, no syllable empty or void
For once You have spoken
All nature and science follow the sound of Your voice
And as You speak, a hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
Evolving in pursuit of what You said
If it all reveals Your nature, so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You say
Every painted sky, a canvas of Your grace
If creation still obeys You, so will I
    So will I,  so will I
If the stars were made to worship, so will I
If the mountains bow in reverence, so will I
If the oceans roar Your greatness, so will I
For if everything exists to lift You high, so will I
If the wind goes where You send it, so will I
If the rocks cry out in silence, so will I
If the sum of all our praises still falls shy
Then we'll sing again a hundred billion times

God of salvation
You chased down my heart through all of my failure and pride
On a hill You created
The light of the world abandoned in darkness to die
And as You speak, a hundred billion failures disappear
Where You lost Your life so I could find it here
If You left the grave behind You, so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've done
Every part designed in a work of art called love
If You gladly chose surrender, so will I
I can see Your heart, eight billion different ways
Every precious one, a child You died to save
If You gave Your life to love them, so will I
Like You would again a hundred billion times

My head is an animal
And once there was an animal
It had a son that mowed the lawn
The son was an ok guy
They had a pet dragonfly
The dragonfly it ran away
But it came back with a story to say
Hey!
Hey!
Her dirty paws and furry coat
She ran down the forest slope
The forest of talking trees
They used to sing about the birds and the bees
The bees had declared a war
The sky wasn't big enough for them all
The birds they got help from below
From dirty paws and the creatures of snow
Hey!
Hey!
And for a while things were cold
They were scared down in their holes
The forest that once was green
Was colored black by those killing machines
But she and her furry friends
Took down the queen bee and her men
And that's how the story goes
The story of the beast with those four dirty paws

cutter shaped heartaches, that come to find ya, four in some velvet morning
Years too late, she's a silver lining, lone ranger riding
Through an open space, in my mind when she's not right there beside me
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""
Are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine?  (Oh ah)
I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end, keep imagining meeting,
Wished away entire lifetimes, unfair we're not somewhere
Misbehaving for days, great escape
Lost track of time and space, she's a silver lining climbing on my desire and
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""
Are you mine?  (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine?  (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine?  (Are you mine, mine?)
And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
So in case I'm mistaken,
I just wanna hear you say you got me baby
Are you mine?

Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing
Didn't have a dime but I always had a vision
Always had high, high hopes
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Didn't know how but I always had a feeling
I was gonna be that one in a million
Always had high, high hopes
Mama said
  Fulfill the prophecy
Be something greater
  Go make a legacy
Manifest destiny
Back in the days
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said
  Burn your biographies
Rewrite your history
Light up your wildest dreams
Museum victories, everyday
We wanted everything, wanted everything
Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting
Had to have high, high hopes for a living
Shooting for the stars when I couldn't make a killing

It's uphill for oddities
The stranger crusaders
  Ain't ever wannabes
The weird and the novelties
Don't ever change
We wanted everything, wanted everything
  Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down
  Stay up on that rise
Stay up on that rise and never come down
Mama said don't give up, it's a little complicated
All tied up, no more love and I'd hate to see you waiting

There's your coffee cup, the lipstick stain fades with time
If I can dream long enough, you'd tell me I'd be just fine
I'll be just fine
So I drown it out like I always do
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
And I chase it down, with a shot of truth
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
Cleaning up today, found that old Zepplin shirt
You wore when you ran away, and no one could feel your hurt
We're too young, too dumb, to know things like love
But I know better now, better now
So I drown it out like I always do
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
And I chase it down, with a shot of truth
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
Too young, too dumb
To know things like love
Too young, too dumb
So I drown it out like I always do
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
And I chase it down, with a shot of truth
That my feet don’t dance like they did with you

I'd wait a million more for you
 Nothing prepared me for 
What the privilege of being yours 
Would do
 If I had only felt 
The warmth within your touch
If I had only seen 
How you smile when you blush 
Or how you curl your lip 
When you concentrate enough
I would have known 
What I was living for all along
What I've been living for
 Your love is my turning page
Where only the sweetest words remain
 Every kiss is a cursive line          
Every touch is a redefined phrase
 I surrender who I've been
For who you are
Nothing makes me stronger than
Your fragile heart
If I had only felt how it feels
To be yours
Then I would have known
What I've been living for all along
What I've been living for
Though we're tethered 
To the story we must tell
When I saw you
Well I knew we'd tell it well
With a whisper 
We will tame the vicious seas
Like a feather

Is there a secret?
Is there a code?
Can we make it better?

Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt
Tell me how 'cause I believe in something

After the dust

Over the riots, above all the noise
Through all the worry, I still hear   your   voice

  In cinema seats learning how to kiss
  Running through streets that were painted gold
  We never believed we'd grow up like this

Tell me now 'cause I believe in something

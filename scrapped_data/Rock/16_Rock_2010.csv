Alarm was shaking, oh
      So ready for you then
To leave where some may stay
What was I waiting for?
What a sick, sick feeling
   To let you go, my dear
'Cause I was not prepared to
Let you go, let you go
      I used to turn you on
I used to be by your side
      I miss the way you sound
I miss to be around you
     Just let me have another chance
What a sick, sick feeling
   To let you go, my dear
'Cause I was not prepared to
Let you go, let you go
What a sick, sick feeling
     To let you go, my dear
'Cause I was not prepared to
Let you go

I met you late night, at a party
Some trust fund baby’s Brooklyn loft
By the bathroom, you said let’s talk,
But my confidence is wearing off
These aren’t my people  These aren’t my friends
She grabbed my face and that’s when she said
I like that you’re broken  broken like me
Maybe that makes me a fool
I like that you’re lonely -  lonely like me
I could be lonely with you
There’s something tragic, but almost pure
Think I could love you, but I’m not sure
There’s something wholesome, there’s something sweet
Tucked in your eyes that I’d love to meet
These aren’t my people  These aren’t my friends

When it is hopeless, I start to notice
And I still feel alive
Falling forward, back into orbit

Drifting as I dream, but I'll wake up soon
To realize the hand of life is reaching out
To rid me of my pride, I call allegiance to myself
I can feel a kick down in my soul
And it's pulling me back to earth to let me know
I am not a slave, can't be contained
So pick me from the dark and pull me from the grave

It will show
Floating in outer space, have I misplaced a part of my soul?
Lost in the in-between, or so it seems, I'm out of control
Floating in outer space, have I misplaced a part of my soul?
Lost in the in-between, but it can't keep me asleep for long, 'cause

Fingevano di essere in un cinepanettone

E invece qua in questa fottuta provincia
Ci vuole del coraggio anche per aver paura

Di notte sopra il tetto di un monolocale
Per mandare un messaggio agli alieni
In fondo anche noi uomini non siamo così male
Un giorno lui le chiese: ""Chiara vuoi sposarmi?""
Con un anello in mano e un sorriso forzato
Lei ci pensò davvero un minuto o due

Mounting mileage on the dash
Double darkness falling fast

Way deep down at some substratum
 Feels like something really wrong has happened
 And I confess I'm barely hanging on

  All my happiness just overflowed
That was life at first and goal to go
Me and you and us and them

All our hardships were just yardsticks then, you know, you know
Not the purple hills
It's not the silver lake
It's not the snowcloud shadowed interstates
It's not the icy bike chain rain of Portland, Oregon
Where nothing's wrong and no one's asking
But the fear's so strong it leaves you gasping
No way to last out here like this for long

I know how much it matters to you
And if you were mine little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd run away and hide with you
I keep on trying to let you go
I'm dying to let you know
How I'm getting on
I didn't cry when you left at first
But now that you're dead it hurts
This time I gotta know
Where did my daddy go?
I'm not entirely here
Half of me has disappeared
Go ahead and cry little boy
You know that your daddy did too
You know what your mama went through
Go ahead and cry little girl
Nobody does it like you do
I know how much it matters to you
And if you were mine little girl
I'd do whatever I could do
I'd rather get high with you
I love that you got daddy issues, and I do too

All that I used to hate
One by one, every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for
Feel like a brand new person

(Stop before it’s too late, I know)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)

(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don’t know why it’s happening
(Stop while it’s not too late)
And I still don’t know
Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
Point is I have the right
I'm thinking in black and white
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time

A realization is as good as it gets
And I know it seems hard to accept

Trots all den kärlek fanns jag ej där 
Jag önskar jag stannat, jag skulle blitt kvar 
Den sista stunden, det borde vart jag, och min far 
Han lärde mig växter och dess namn på latin 
Om fideikommiss och Boursin 
Men följde mig gärna in i glamrockens land 
Tog del av min kunskap om engelska band 
Allt från John Strummer till Johnny Mars 
Stod på agendan då det var jag, och min far 
Jag saknar den humor, som var hans sigill  
Den som la grunden för att jag finns till 
Som präglat min uppväxt, ända fram tills Idag 
Som gjort att min son är densamma som jag 
Jag får ta del av drömmar han har 
På samma vis som då det var jag, och min far 
Där borta vid pilen, har jag lagt min far 
En anonym urna är allt som finns kvar 
Fast jag fann aldrig modet till att säga adjö 
Trodde nog aldrig att du kunde dö

47,A Song About Being Sad,Rex Orange County,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/rex-orange-county/a-song-about-being-sad-chords-1979507,"Always felt like I needed to please her, or impress her
Though only in the hope that one day I would undress her
Don't be offended
You think I'm 'bout to tell you that ""I love you""
But I really really really fucking don't
See the months of obsession
And crying for hours
I even started sitting down in the shower, girl
I'll take my time on my own
And I'll be fine now I'm alone
Constantly told stories with a stretch of the truth
Trying hard to make memories to re - member from youth
Desperately wanting you to be interested too
It's not clear what I need yet
But it's clear it's not you
Here's what I'd say to any young man that's still interested in you
 Do you prioritise the things in your life
The things that you hope to do
Mate you'd better trust me when I tell you that
It's not worth forgetting about yourself
She may seem perfect, and gorgeous, and lovely
You'll think she likes you
I mean I thought she loved me, no
But no
Neither of us will get down from the shelf
The only one she loves is herself

I wear a demeanor made of bright pretty things
What she wears, what she wears, what she wears
Birds singing on my shoulder in harmony it seems
How they sing, how they sing, how they sing
Give me nights of solitude, red wine just a glass or two, 
Reclined in a hammock on a balmy evening
I’ll pretend that it's no thing that's skipping my heart when I think
Of you thinking of me babe I'm crazy over you
Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah
There's something in the water, something in the water
Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah
There's something in the water, that makes me love you like –
I've got halo's made of summer, rhythms made of spring
What she wears, what she wears, what she wears
I got crowns of words a woven each one a song to sing
Oh I sing, oh I sing, oh I sing
Give me long days in the sun, preludes to the nights to come
Previews of the mornings laying in all lazy 
Give me something fun to do like a life of loving you
Kiss me quick now baby I'm still crazy over you
Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah
There's something in the water, something in the water
Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah
There's something in the water, that makes me love you like I do
Oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh
Give me nights of solitude
Red wine just a glass or two
Give me something fun to do
Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah
There's something in the water, something in the water
Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah
There's something in the water, that makes me love you like I do  
Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah
There's something in the water, something in the water
Aaah Aaah Aaah Aaah
There's something in the water, that makes me love you like I do

49,I Dont Wanna Be Funny Anymore,Lucy Dacus,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lucy-dacus/i-dont-wanna-be-funny-anymore-chords-1833037,"  I don't wanna be funny anymore.
  I don't wanna be funny anymore. 
Lately, I've been feeling like the odd man out.
I hurt my friends saying things I don't mean out loud.
  I don't wanna be funny anymore. 
I got a too short skirt, maybe I can be the cute one.
Is there room in the band? I don't need to be the front man. 
If not, then I'll be the biggest fan.
  I don't want the joke to be on me.
Yeah, I'll buy the clothes and I'll be the best dressed.
Yeah, I'll read the books and I'll be the smartest.
I'll play guitar and I'll be the artist.
  Try not to laugh.
  I know it'll be hard.
  I'm serious.
  I know it's a first but...
  I don't wanna be funny anymore.
I'll be the gossip, hear it through the grape vine.
Pass it on, she's done with the old times.
  That funny girl doesn't wanna smile for a while.

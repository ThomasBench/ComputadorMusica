I don’t know why I keep on
Thinking that we’re friends
‘Cause we don’t really talk anymore
And I’m sorry for that
Honestly I never really loved you that bad
And I could be the end of it
But I never know when to stop talking
So I make my bed and sleep in it alone
‘Cause I never know when we’re done talking
If I don’t love you, then why…
…did I call you again?
I think that I was lonely
And I missed having friends
Now we don’t really talk anymore
And it’s good for us both
‘Cause I know you love me the most
And I should be the end of it
But I never know when to stop talking
So I make my bed and sleep in it alone
‘Cause I never know when we’re done talking
And I should be the end of it
But I never know when to stop talking
So I make my bed and sleep in it alone
‘Cause I never know when we’re done talking
You’re better off on your own
But you called me again
I don’t know why it never seems to end
Now we don’t really talk anymore
And it makes sense
‘Cause all I do is hurt you
All I do is hurt you
All I do is cause you pain
‘Cause I called you again

 Your voice always takes the pain away
The thought is unimaginable
That I saw you for the last time and didn't know
You were the one that I wasn't supposed to lose
I thought I'd have you for my lifetime

Now, I'm walking around in a haze
 There's no color, only darker shades of gray
You showed me the way when I was lost and alone
But you never really showed me how to let you go
You were the one that I wasn't supposed to lose
I thought I'd have you for my lifetime
Have you for a lifetime
Who do I talk to when I want to talk to you
I thought I'd have you for a lifetime

Never again, will I look into the only eyes that knew me
Feels like a bullet running through me
Never again!

Do you wait for your dancing lessons to be sent from god?

You've really missed a trick when it comes to love
Always seeking what you don't have like what you do ain't enough
   You'd like a light to shine on you
  And every book you take and you dust off from the shelf
   Has lines between lines between lines
   That you read about yourself, but does a light shine on you?
   When your friends are talking you hardly hear a word
   You were the first person here
And the last man on the earth
   But does a light shinе on you?
Who were you to ask for anything else?
The thing you should be asking is for help
You'd like a light to shine on you
Let it shine on you
Let it shine on you
   A penny for your truth but I hedge my bets on love
   'Cause it's lies after lies after lies

And turning back, hell I be damn I’m turning into to my old man
Am I the only one still willing to bleed, or take a bullet for being free
Screaming what the fuck at my TV, are you telling me, are you telling me
That am I the only one still willing fight for the love of my red and white
And the blue burning on the ground as the statues fall down in a town near you
Watching the threads of old glory come undone
Am I the only one
Am I the only one not brainwashed making my way through the land of the lost
And still gives a shit and worries about his kids, while they try to undo all the things he did
Am I the only one, can't take no more saying if you don't like it there's the fucking door
This ain't the freedom we been fighting for, it was something more, it was something more

gave, god bless the USA

Cause he's coloring my insides ocean blue

It's true
Up in my imagination, I rehearse our conversations
And at least I'm never lonely
Even though I know you're only in my mind
And there's no point in covering my eyes
I hear your voice over and over
Sitting on the beach of Dover
What is happening, oh, dear?
I keep wishing you were here
And I swear, I'm gonna lose it
If I keep playing your music
But what else is there to do?
Everywhere I look I just see you
In my self made isolation,
You're my only inspiration
When the mirror says I'm ugly
And if anybody loves me, it's a lie
And right before I'm swallowed
By my mind and cursing at the sky
I hear your voice over and over
Sitting on the beach of Dover

I keep wishing you were here
And I swear, I'm gonna lose it

The world ends,   it's you and me

Maybe we'll live forever

I've got vertigo
I'm afraid of heights
If I could I'd cry
We've got incompatible star signs
What's the point in looking at the view?
It's deep red,   my broken dream
My last breath,   the king and queen
The world ends,   it's you and me
In my head, if we can be together
Maybe we'll live forever

You've practiced your lines
To convince us you’re fine
But I know that’s not where you are
Once in a blue moon
You may come undone

Give you reason to get out of bed

And help you escape from your head

Watch a super 8 videotape
We were kids in the car
Having lighthearted arguments
We don’t know what’s there till it’s gone
Just hear me out
And you might understand

My tears fall, you don't miss me
Put me out of my misery
Think my heart is history
I think I'm broken and nothing could fix me
I made up my mind this evening
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
Drink while my conscience eats me
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
I'm rеady to let you go
I'm rеady to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
Yeah!
Woah, woah, woah, woah
We were built to fall apart
Woah, woah, woah, woah
But I can't feel you now
And it's too late now
There's no point screaming
Dug your grave, so fuck your feelings
No one's here, so now you're on your own
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
Drink while my conscience eats me
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
I'm rеady to let you go
I'm rеady to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
This time is the last, this time is the last

Waiting at the boxcar like you wanted
I waited, you called
Then you never made it
I'm just sad alone
Tryin' to pick it up and move along
You said you're ready for a long time
But you're on a roll of making fine
Let me be no other
Living like another sip and I'll be fine
But then I'm coming off again
Wouldn't even remember that same look you're hiding there
I never seem to knock it anyhow
Knock it back and pow
Amazing, I cave in
As all my worries slip away again
One for the party baby
Puff on the rolled drum and
Knock back a drink
Thеre's nobody home
Waking up Monday only to realizе
That your Saturday self ain't one you like
But I get by, don't you know?
Give up baby go
Last night I dropped acid
And came to know of all things passing
Most just get away
That's what George's records say
But I'm just sad alone
Tryin' to live right back in years ago
You said you're ready for a long time
But you're on a roll of getting high
Let me be  no other
Living like another sip and I'll be fine
But then I'm coming off again
Wouldn't even remember that same look you're hiding there
I never seem to knock it anyhow
Knock it back and pow
Amazing, I cave in
As all my worries slip away again

Puff on the rolled drum and
Knock back a drink

Waking up Monday only to realizе
That your Saturday self ain't one you like

Just so you could sleep the night trough.
I was staying by your side.
Just so I knew you were okay.
And I was opening the door.
Just to see if you would walk through.
I started painting all the walls.
Just to see if you like the shade.
I would love just to be stuck to your side.
Not with anybody else, anybody else.
It's enough just to keep us occupied.

but I don't see the plane
What the hell is my problem
with taking the blame?
'Cuz I play with my food
then someone else takes it away
It's so hard to believe
but I'm trying to change
I see lines in the sand
but I don't see who made them
I still listen to that band
You showed me last april
I still play with my food
I'm a child at the grown up's table
It's so hard to believe
but right now I feel stable
   I moved away, and I grew a few inches
   what a shame, I had a chance and I missed it
   and there are some days when I hear that song and I hate to admit it
But I admit I do
Oh I miss it, I miss you
I miss it, I miss you
   ooooooohhhhh
I miss it, I miss you
I see chemtrails in the sky
but I don't see the plane
I know that I feel it, but I don't know the name
I play with my food
and then I throw it away
It's so hard to believe
I have to grow up this way
  I moved on and I made some new friends
  Sometimes when I shout
it feels like no-one hears it
  and there are some days
When I think that somewhere you're watching
as I grow up without you
I miss it, I miss youuu
I miss it, I miss youuuuuuu

You said it looked better on me than it did you
Only if you knew, how much I liked you
But I watch your eyes as she
Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes, brighter
than a blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die
Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better
(Wish I were Heather)
Watch as she stands with her, holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder
But how could I hate her? She's such an angel
But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she

What a sight for sore eyes, brighter
than a blue sky

0,Let It Loose,The Rolling Stones,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-rolling-stones/let-it-loose-chords-50299,"   Who's that woman on your arm
   all dressed up to do you harm?
   And I'm hip to what she'll do,
    give her just about a month or two.
   Bit off more than I can chew
   and I knew what it was leading to,
   Some things, well, I can't refuse,
   One of them, one of them the bedroom blues.
   She delivers right on time,
   I can't resist a corny line,
   But take the shine right off your shoes,
   Carryin', carryin' the bedroom blues.
Oo... In the bar you're getting drunk,
   I ain't in love, I ain't in love.
   Hide the switch and shut the light,
   let it all come down tonight.
   Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger,
   Some face you'll never see no more.
   Let it all come down tonight.
   Keep those tears hid out of sight,
   let it loose, let it all come down.

Muskrat, muskrat candlelight,
In the evenin'
It's pretty pleasin'.
Muskrat Susie, Muskrat Sam
And they shimmy
And Sammy's so skinny.
And they whirled and they twirled and they tangoed
Singin' and jingin' the jango
Floatin' like the heavens above
It looks like muskrat love.
Nibbling on bacon, chewin' on cheese,
Sammy says to Susie ""Honey, would you please be my missus?""
And she say ""yes"" with her kisses.
Now he's ticklin' her fancy, rubbin' her toes
As they wriggle, and Sue starts to giggle.
And they whirled and they twirled and they tangoed
Singin' and jingin' the jango
Floatin' like the heavens above
It looks like muskrat love.

The sun ain't gonna be my friend,
Lying here, awaiting here
And wishing I knew when...
We'll never have to say goodbye again.
We'll never have to say goodbye again.
You must leave, I know you will
I won't let you go until
You show me the secret
For making this time stand still.
And somewhere sometime from now,
Together again somehow.
All of the waiting will seem
Like a moment and then...
We'll never have to say goodbye again.
We'll never have to say goodbye again.

And the whole day crying
Wishing I knew when...

With her hands on her hips,

because she knows that it kills me
With her soft French cream,
standing in that doorway like a dream;
I wish she'd just leave me alone
Because French cream won't soften them boots,
and French kisses will not break that heart of stone
With her long hair falling,
and her eyes that shine like a midnight sun;
woah, she's the one,      she's the one
With the thunder in your heart,
at night, when you're kneeling in the dark;
it says you're never gonna leave her
But there's this angel in her eyes,
that tells such desperate lies;
and all you want to do is believe her
And tonight you'll try, just one more time,
to leave it all behind and to break on through
Oh, she can take you, but if she wants to break you,
she's gonna find out that ain't so easy to do
And no matter where you sleep tonight, or how far you run;
woah, she's the one,      she's the one
Woah, and just one kiss she'd fill them long summer nights, with her tenderness 
That secret pact you made, back when her love could save, you from the 
bitterness, oo oo

26,Standing In The Doorway,Bob Dylan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bob-dylan/standing-in-the-doorway-chords-1452265,"  I’m walking through the summer nights
  Jukebox   playing low
  Yesterday everything was going too fast
  Today, it’s moving too slow
 I got no place left to turn
 I got nothing left to burn
Don’t know if I saw you, if I would kiss you or kill you
  It probably wouldn’t matter to you anyhow
 You left me standing in the doorway, crying
 I got nothing to go back to now
  The light in this place is so bad
  Making me sick in the head
  All the laughter is just making me sad
  The stars have turned cherry red
 I’m strumming on my gay guitar
 Smoking a cheap cigar
  The ghost of our old love has not gone away
  Don’t look [it (?)] like it will anytime soon
 You left me standing in the doorway, crying
  Under the midnight moon
  Maybe they’ll get me and maybe they won’t
  But not tonight and it won’t be here
  There are things I could say    but I don’t
  I know the mercy of God must be near
 I’ve been riding the midnight train
 Got ice water in my veins
  I would be crazy if I took you back
  It would go up against every rule
 You left me standing in the doorway, crying
  Suffering like a fool
When the last rays      of daylight go down
  Buddy, you’ll roll no more
  I can hear the church bells   ringing in the yard
  I wonder who they’re ringing for
 I know I can’t win
 But my heart just won’t give in
  Last night I danced with a stranger
But she just reminded me you were the one
 You left me standing in the doorway, crying
 In the dark land of the sun
  I’ll eat when I’m hungry, drink when I’m dry
  And live my life on the square
  And even if the flesh falls off of my face
  I know someone will be there to care
 It always means so much
   Even the softest touch
I see nothing to be gained by   any   explanation
There’s no words that need to be  said
 You left me standing in the doorway, crying
  Blues wrapped around my head

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an off-hand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun!
*(add this part)@ ""No one told you when to run, (Play that part right here) you missed the starting gun!""
==========================================================================================================
And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking.
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired.
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away, across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spell.   **(D7#9 and D7b9 both strum it and end the song with Bm)

Many times I've gazed along the open road. 
Many times I've lied - Many times I've listened

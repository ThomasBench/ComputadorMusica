In un mondo che non ci vuole piu`
il mio canto libero sei tu
e l'immensita`si apre intorno a noi
aldila` del limite degli occhi tuoi
nasce il sentimento, nasce in mezzo al pianto
e s'innalza al tissimo e va
e vola sulle accuse della gente
a tutti i suoi retaggi indifferente
sorretto da un anelito d'amor
e riscopro te
dolce compagna che
non sai dove andare
al fianco tuo mi avrai
se tu lo vuoi
pietre un giorno case
ricoperte dalle rose selvatiche
rivivono, ci chiamano
boschi abbandonati
e percio` sopravvissuti vergini
si aprono, ci abbracciano
di vero amore e riscopro te

  Laughed at his long black hair, his animal grace
    The boy in the bright blue jeans
  Jumped up on the stage
And Lady Stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and disgrace
And he was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, the songs went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight
And he sang all night long
  The femme fatales emerged from shadows
To watch this creature fair
  Boys stood upon their chairs to make their point of view
    I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
And Lady Stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and dismay
And he was alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, the songs went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite paradise
And he sang all night long
Ooh, how I sighed when they asked if I knew his name
Oh they were alright, the band was altogether
Yes he was alright, and the song went on forever
He was up all night  really quite out of sight
He sang all night long

I gazed a gazely stare at all the millions here

You turned it on the world, that's when you turned the world around
  Did you feel like Jesus?     Did you realise
That you were a champion in their eyes?
  On the hill the stuff was laced with kerosene
But yours was kitchen clean. Everyone stopped to stare at your technicolour motorhome
  Every A-frame had your number on the wall
You must have had it all. You'd go to LA on a dare and you'd go it alone
  Could you live forever?  Could you see the day?
Did you feel your whole world fall apart and fade away?

look at all the white men on the street
Get along            Get along Kid Charlemagne
 Get along Kid Charlemagne
  Clean this mess up else we'll all end up in jail
Those test tubes and the scale, just get it all out of here

  Careful what you carry  'cause the man is wise.

Caught in slow motion in a dash for the door.
The flame from your stage has now spread to the floor
You gave all you had. why you wanna give more?
The more that you give, the more it will take
To the thin line beyond which you really can't fake.

All the birds that were singing are flown, except you alone.

On my hands and my knees, I will roll, roll, roll.
Make myself a bed in the waterside,
In my time, In my time, I will roll, roll roll.
In a bed, in a bed,
By the waterside I will lay my head.
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul.
River going to take me, sing me sweet and sleepy,
Sing me sweet and sleepy all the way back home.
It's a far gone lullaby, sung many years ago.
Mama, mama many worlds I've come since I first left home.
Goin' home, goin' home,
By the waterside I will rest my bones,
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul.
Going to plant a weeping willow,
On the bank's green edge it will grow, grow, grow.
Sing a lullaby beside the water,
Lovers come and go, the river roll, roll, roll.
Fare you well, fare you well,
I love you more than words can tell,
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul.

I went out on the sea for adventure
Expanding the view of the captain and crew
like a man just released from indenture
As a dreamer of dreams and a travelin' man
I have chalked up many a mile.
Read dozens of books about heroes and crooks
and I learned much from both of their styles.
Son of a son, Son of a son
Son of a son of a sailor
Son of a gun, Load the last ton
One step ahead of the jailor
Now way in the near future,
Southeast of disorder
You can shake the hand of the mango man
As he greets you at the border
And the lady she hails from trinidad,
Island of the spices
Salt for your meat, and cinnamon sweet
And the rum is for all your good vices.
Haul the sheet in as we ride on the wind
That our fore-fathers harnessed before us
Hear the bells ring as the tight rigging sings
It's a son of a gun of a chorus
Now where it all ends, I can't fathom my friends
If I knew I might toss out my anchor
So I'll cruise along always searching for songs
Not a lawyer, a thief or a banker
But a son of a son, son of a son
Son of a son of a sailor
Son of a gun, load the last ton
One step ahead of the jailor
I'm just a son of a son, son of a son
Son of a son of a sailor
The sea's in my veins, my tradition remains
I'm just glad I don't live in a trailer

Si vede quello che pensi
Quello che sogni
E qualche volta fai pensieri strani...

They were planting in the Full Moon,
They had given all they had for something new,
But the light of day was on them,
They could see the thrasher coming,
And the water shone like diamonds in the dew.
And I was just getting up,
To hit the road before its light,
trying to catch an hour on the sun,
When I saw those thrashers rolling by,
Looking more than  two lanes wide,
I was feeling like my day had just begun.
Where the eagles glide descending,
There's an ancient river bending,
Down the timeless gorge of changes where sleeplessness awaits,
I searched out my companions,
who were lost in crystal canyons,
When the aimless blade of science slashed the pearly gates,
It was then I knew I'd had enough, burned my credit card for fuel,
Headed out to where the pavement turns to sand,
With a one-way ticket to the land of truth and my suitcase in my hand.
How I lost my friends I still dont understand.
They had the best selection,
They were poisoned with protection,
There was nothing that they needed, 
nothing left to find.
They were lost in rock formations,
Or became park bench mutations,
On the the sidewalks and in the stations,      they were waiting, waiting.
So I got bored and left them there,
They were just dead weight to me,
Better down the road without that load,
Bring's back the time I was eight or nine,
I was watching my Mama's TV,
It was that great Grand Canyon rescue episode.
With the vulture glides descending,
On an asphalt highway bending,
Through libraries and museums,       galaxies and stars.
Down the windy halls of friendship,
To the rose clipped by the bullwhip,
The motel of lost companions waits with heated pool and bar.
But me, I'm not stopping there,
Got my own row left to hoe,
Just another line in the field of time.
When the thrashers come I'll be stuck in the sun,
Like the dinosaurs in shrines,
But I'll know the time has come to give what's mine.

Outside the Seven-Eleven store

And he rides with me from town to town
We only run for the money got no strings attached
We shut `em up and then we shut `em down
Tonight, tonight the strip's just right
I wanna blow `em off in my first heat
Summer's here and the time is right
For racin' in the street
We take all the action we can meet
And we cover all the northeast state
When the strip shuts down we run `em in the street
From the fire roads to the interstate

And start dying little by little piece by piece
Some guys come home from work and wash up
Then go racin' in the street
Tonight, tonight the strip's just right
I wanna blow `em all out of their seats
Calling out around the world
We're going racin' in the street
I met her on the strip three years ago
In a Camaro with this dude from L.A.
I blew that Camaro off my back 
And drove that little girl away
But now there's wrinkles around my baby's eyes
And she cries herself to sleep at night
When I come home the house is dark
She sighs ""Baby did you make it all right""
She sits on the porch of her daddy's house
But all her pretty dreams are torn
She stares off alone into the night
With the eyes of one who hates for just being born
For all the shut-down strangers and hot rod angels 
Rumbling through this promised land
Tonight my baby and me we're gonna ride to the sea
And wash these sins off our hands
Tonight, tonight the highway's bright
Out of our way mister you best keep
`Cause summer's here and the time is right
We're goin' racin' in the street

She came from Providence, the one in Rhode Island
Where the old world shadows hang, heavy in the air
She packed her hopes and dreams, like a refugee
Just as her father came, across the sea
She heard about a place, people were smiling
Spoke about the red man's ways, how they loved the land
They came from everywhere, to the Great Divide
Seeking a place to stand, or a place to hide
Down in the crowded bars, out for a good time
Can't wait to tell you all, what it's like up there
They called it paradise, I don't know why
Somebody laid the mountains low, while the town got high
When the chilly winds blew down, across the desert
Through the canyons of the coast, to the Malibus
Where the pretty people played, hungry for power
To light their neon ways, give 'em things to do
Some rich man came and raped the land, nobody caught him
Put up a bunch of ugly boxes, and Jesus people bought them
They called it paradise, the place to be
They watched the hazy sun, sinking in the sea
(Regular G and C work fine)
You can leave it all behind, sail to Lahaina
Just like the missionaries did, so many years ago
They even brought a neon sign, Jesus is Coming
Brought the white man's burden down, brought the white man's reign
And we'll provide the grand design, what is yours and what is mine
'cause there is no more new frontier, we have got to make it here
We satisfied our endless needs, and justified our bloody deeds
In the name of destiny, and in the name of God
And you can see them there, on Sunday morning
Stand up and sing about, what it's like up there
They called it paradise, I don't know why
To call someplace paradise, kiss it goodbye

49,Have You Ever Seen The Rain (ver 4),Creedence Clearwater Revival,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/creedence-clearwater-revival/have-you-ever-seen-the-rain-chords-1242786,"Someone told me long ago there's a calm before the storm,
I know, it's been comin for some time.
When it's over, so they say, it'll rain a sunny day,
I know, shinin' down like water.
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain? 
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Comin down on a sunny day? 
Yesterday, and days before, sun is cold and rain is hard,
I know, been that way for all my time.
Till forever, on it goes, through the circle, fast and slow,
I know, it can't stop, I wonder.
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain? 
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Comin down on a sunny day?    Yeah!
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain? 
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Comin down on a sunny day?

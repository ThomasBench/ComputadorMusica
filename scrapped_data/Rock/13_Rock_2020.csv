It echoes still I'm sure, but I can't hear it
Was it gentle or cold, or maybe just noise, ah
I heard what I wanted, until     I couldn't
And I, scared to lose
I was left of you
Time moves slow, I just talk to myself
I finish my own sentences, the way     you used to
Why do memories glow? The way real moments don't
My altar is full of all loves delusions
And I,        mmm
And I,      mmm
And I, scared to lose
And I was left of you
And I     should forget
And I love was left
The first thing to go was the sound of his voice

Spelled with all 4 y's
Was born in 70-something
Between ""Sweet Home"" & ""You Got That Right""
His mama met his daddy
At a Tallahassee show
But just like Tuesday
Daddy wound up gone on down the road
Lynyrd Skynyrd Jones
Hailed from Gadsden, Alabama
Born to carry on
Who his mama was a fan of
Don't ask me no questions
And I won't tell you no lies
That's what she always told him
Right up till the day she died
Lynyrd wasn't black or white
He was somewhere in between
Throw in, abandoned and confused
And you get the blues when you're just thirteen
Well he found his salvation
In a pawn shop bought guitar
You can't teach that kind of pickin'
It's got to come right from your heart

Yeah son, I am your daddy

È tardi devo andare, no, rimani qui
Adesso viene il meglio, sì, ma cosa è meglio di così?

Col telefono che è spento

E poi chi se ne frega
Stanotte siamo tutti
Chissà se sta finendo il mondo

La musica che esiste solo su YouTube

La Kodak usa e getta solo per la gita

With an army of convenience
From a region whose hopes and dreams bordered mediocrity
Profiteering through theocracy
Soldiers of fortune from the most unfortunate
Army of god carrying tripods
Extremism, dressed like your mom
Against all known gods
Butchering, raping, killing, and burning,
brutally beheading your enemies
What kind of retarded promises
have led you to these prophecies
Despicable fool you're just a fucking tool,
you'll never get to rule, you'll die on your knees
What kind of retarded finances
have led you to these fantasies
Devised as fighters against the wrong
Riding our special horses
Funded and supported by royal decree
Don't forget radical greed
Butchering, raping, killing, and burning,
brutally beheading your enemies
What kind of retarded promises
have led you to these prophecies
Despicable fool you're just a fucking tool,
you'll never get to rule, you'll die on your knees
What kind of retarded finances
have led you to these fantasies
So you want to die, You wanna die
Gonna die for your god
Wanna die for your god
Wanna die for your god
Wanna die for your god      Nananana...

Think about it every day

Will I find what we once had?
I guess I ruined us pretty bad

It started off slow, but you'll get there quick
Zip that coat so you don't get sick
Believe in yourself boy, that's the trick
You're building this thing up, brick by brick""

And she'd take me home from school
She made me believe in magic
She knew Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy too
Momma told me Imma be a star one day

She told me I need to pick up my phone
If it doesn't work out, you can come back home
Knew I couldn't go, 'cuz I'm too grown
Gotta figure this out alone

In the center of Downtown L.A
Hugged me and said you just getting started
I know that my star will find a way

Singing as I stir my wheel, oh dear

I have whispered through the tears and pleaded sweetly to your face

Never needed more than I could hold
    Running and returning
In a vision you're a ghost in black and white
A silhouette in blue and green
I lay awake at night and wait for you to come
Been hangin' on so hard and now I can't let go
I'm in a rollin' wave
   That moves across the line
Am I losin' my faith?
   We're gonna lose it in time
    Leaves are falling down like rain
In the mornin', I just stand alone outside
And I watch 'em blow away
It's so hard to find a friеnd these days
Oh, babe I'm sinkin'
    Summеr comes and rain gets in
It's like I'm lookin' through the glass on the other side
I'm not tryna make you wait
But I don't need it anymore, and I can't turn back
And give it all away when it's all I have
I'm in a rollin' wave
   That moves across the line
Am I losin' my faith?
   We're gonna lose it in time
Sometimes forwards is the only way back
To reach the hill in time
I was lost in the light that can't be seen
Dmon't move around in front of me
I'm gonna see, I'm on a drive
You lay awake, you know the way
You know the path I'm walkin' on
Are we the cast you're leanin' on?
You know the coast, you're on your own
Where I'm goin' like a light that can't be seen
Dmon't look away, it's just a dream
I'm out of touch, so out of reach
It's comin' back and I'm movin' fast
Just one more day and I'm home at last
I need that love I'm dreamin' on, I know the cost
You're on your own
Oh
You're on your own
Oh

No matter where I go
Seems I can only see green eyes
Calling a siren song out of time
Out here the lights hum low
And your return unknown
Still I can feel your lips on mine
Falling, indecision's hold on my mind
 She don't lie she walks on A passerby
 In a dream You feel as though it'll never die
Oooooohh In my dark you are the light
 Funny how the feeling never goes
Oooooohh When I'm wrong you are the right
 Carry the memory in my soul
And when the day is done
Think on the things I've done
Holding a piece you left inside
Oh yeah, gonna have to last me till the end of line
Oh, end of the line
 She don't lie she walks on A passerby
 In a dream You feel as though it'll never die
Oooooohh In my dark you are the light
 Funny how the feeling never goes
Oooooohh When I'm wrong you are the right
 Carry the memory in my soul
Aaaahaaaahh In my dark you are the light
 Carry you with me in my soul

Cut my hair in the way that I've wanted
Change my number and bury my wallet
California makes me exhausted
I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost
Heard a poem about mid October
How the leaves in the fall feel like closure
About a girl that the guy wasn't over
Think that I might relate when I'm older
I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost
Tough I don't know a lot that could hurt me
Learned the hard way to forget my body
Till you're walking around like a zombie
Still don't know how to talk through that story

To a vicious low whine of a chainsaw's grind
In the summertime
There's a coppery taste
A gun in your face
Hi plains drift, sly shapes shift across the Maritime
In the estuary
There's a clue to find
In the fantasy life of poetry and crime
Haute-Normandy and Seine-Maritime
In the fantasy life of poetry and crime
Je suis ici
Can you follow me?
Oh, sorrowful me
Have I begun this too weirdly?
Sweet mystery and a clue to find
In the fantasy life of poetry and crime

Die Liebe muss frei sein, nur dann ist sie echt
Du kannst sie nicht halten, wenn sie dich verlässt
Sie kommt unerwartet und ist nur geliehen
Und will sie dann weiter, lass sie ziehen
Was du liebst, lass los
Was du liebst, lass frei
Es wird wiederkehren, so es Liebe sei
Was du liebst, lass los
Was du liebst, lass frei
Was wahrhaft dein ist, bleibt dir treu
   Was du liebst, lass frei
            Was du liebst
Die Liebe muss wild sein, nur so ist sie schön
Und lässt du sie atmen, wird sie zu dir stehen
Sie folgt ihren Wegen und nicht deinem Plan
Und kommt sie zu dir, dann denk' daran
Was du liebst, lass los
Was du liebst, lass frei
Es wird wiederkehren, so es Liebe sei
Was du liebst, lass los
Was du liebst, lass frei
Was wahrhaft dein ist, bleibt dir treu
   Was du liebst, lass frei
Und auch wenn dir das Herz dabei bricht
Lass sie frei sein und halte sie nicht
Und führt das Schicksal sie wieder zu dir
Dann sei da
Bei ihr
Was du liebst, lass los
Was du liebst, lass frei
Es wird wiederkehren, so es Liebe sei
Was du liebst, lass los
Was du liebst, lass frei
Was wahrhaft dein ist, bleibt dir treu

And when the silence comes
It breaks my heart
When I'm lonely
I always fall apart
And when I'm left behind
I climb the walls
Never knowing
If you really cared at all
Did you get to where you're going
To the place you're meant to be
Still I'm holding out that you'll return to me
Somewhere
Somewhere beyond
Turn the key
Please come back to me
What I'd give to know you'll fill my world again
Thе wind is screaming out
I pace the floor
And I wondеr will I see your face once more
You were always here to save me
Like sentinel in the dark
As the thunder keeps on rolling
Through my heart
But still some way
I keep holding on
Turn the key
Please come back to me
For how long will you be gone
I'm barely breathing
Because all I know
Is that I miss you so
What I'd give to know you'll fill my world again
Say it won't be long
It won't be long
Say it won't be long
It won't be long
Till you'll come home
Turn the key
Please come back to me
For how long will you be gone
I'm barely breathing
Because all I know
Is that I miss you so

It won't be long
Say it won't be long
It won't be long

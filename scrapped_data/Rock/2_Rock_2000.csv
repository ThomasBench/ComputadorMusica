0,Wherever You Will Go,The Calling,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-calling/wherever-you-will-go-chords-37465,"So lately you're wondering who will be there to take my place
When I'm gone you'll need love to light the shadows on your face
If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all
Then between sand and stone could you make it on your own?
If I could then I would I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low I'll go wherever you will go
And maybe I'll find out a way to make it back someday
To watch you to guide you through the darkest of your days
If a great wave shall fall and fall upon us all
Well, then I hope there's someone out there who can bring me back to you
If I could then I would I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low I'll go wherever you will go
     Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love
  I know now just quite how
  My life and love might still go on
In your heart in your mind
  I'll stay with you for all of time
If I could then I would I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low I'll go wherever you will go
If I could turn back time I'll go wherever you will go
If I could make you mine, I'll go wherever you will goooooooooooo
oooooooo    I'll go wherever you will gooooooooo

1,The Man Who Cant Be Moved,The Script,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-script/the-man-who-cant-be-moved-chords-716149,"Going back to the corner where I first saw you,
Gonna camp in my sleeping bag, no I'm not gonna move,
Got some words on cardboard got your picture in my hand,
Saying if you see this girl can you tell her where I am,
Some try to hand me money they don't understand,
I'm not... broke I'm just a broken hearted man,
I know it makes no sense, but what else can I do,
How can I move on when I'm still in love with you...
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me,
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I can be,
Thinking maybe you'd come back here to the place that we'd meet,
And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street.
So I'm not moving...
I'm not moving.
Policeman says, son you can't stay here,
I said there's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year,
Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows,
If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go.
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me,
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I can be,
Thinking maybe you'd come back here to the place that we'd meet,
And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street.
So I'm not moving...
I'm not moving.
So I'm not moving...
I'm not moving.
So I'm not moving...
I'm not moving.
People talk about the guy
Who's waiting on a girl...
There are no holes in his shoes
But a big hole in his world...
Maybe I'll get famous as the man who can't be moved,
And maybe you won't mean to but you'll see me on the news,
And you'll come running to the corner...
'Cause you'll know it's just for you
I'm the man who can't be moved...
'Cause if one day you wake up and find that you're missing me,
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I can be,
Thinking maybe you'd come back here to the place that we'd meet,

You won't get out the county, 'cos you're damned and free

A melancholy town where we never smile.
And all I wanna hear is the message beep.
My dreams, they've got to kiss, because I don't get sleep, no..

Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all there on your stride
It is sinking, falling down
Love forever love is free
Let's turn forever you and me

Is everybody in?
Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats,
Lining them up-a like ass cracks,
Lay these ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack.
Shit, I'm stepping in the heart of this here
Care bear bumping in the heart of this here
Watch me as I gravitate

Yo, we gonna go ghost town, this motown,
With yo sound, you're in the place
You gonna bite the dust, can't fight with us
With yo sound you kill the INC.

Until you're Jet Ahead.
Yo, watch the way I navigate

You gotta stand up straight, carry your own weight
These tears are going nowhere baby

The colors that you bring
But the night you filled with fireworks
They left you with nothing
I am still enchanted
By the light you brought to me
I still listen through your ears
And through your eyes I can see
And you are such a fool
To worry like you do
I know it's tough
And you can never get enough
Of what you don't really need now....my oh my

My name is Adam I'm your biggest fan
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone

Squinched up your face and did a dance
You shook a little turd out of the bottom of your pants

It's like the bottom of the ninth and I'm never gonna win
This life hasn't turned out quite the way I want to be.
I want a brand new house on an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough for ten plus me
I need a, a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club at thirty-seven thousand feet
I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and James Dean is fine for me
I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name
Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving 15 cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny cause we just won't eat and we'll
Hang out in the coolest bars, in the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every playboy bunny with her bleached blonde hair and we'll
Hey, hey I wanna be a rockstar
Hey, hey I wanna be a rockstar
I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs so I can eat my meals for free
I'm gonna dress my ass with the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to blow my money for me
I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name
Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving 15 cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny cause we just won't eat and we'll
Hang out in the coolest bars, in the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every playboy bunny with her bleached blonde hair and we'll
And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary of today's who's who
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial
Hey, hey I wanna be a rockstar
Hey, hey I wanna be a rockstar
I'm gonna sing those songs that offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills from a Pez dispenser
Get washed-up singers writing all my songs 
Lip sync 'em every night so I don't get 'em wrong
Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
And live in hilltop houses driving 15 cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny cause we just won't eat and we'll

Haunting familiar, yet I can't seem to place it
cannot find the candle of thought to light your name
lifetimes are catchin' up with me
all these changes taking place
I wish I'd seen the place
but no one's ever taken me
hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
I swear I recognize your breath
memories, like fingerprints are slowly raising
you wouldn't recall, for I'm not my former
it's hard when you're stuck upon the shelf
I changed by not changing at all
small town predicts my fate
perhaps that's what no one wants to see
I just want to scream, ""hello!""
my god, it's been so long, never dreamed you'd return
but now here you are and here I am
hearts and thoughts they fade away              x8

Excuse me but can I be you for a while
My dog won't bite if you sit real still
I got the anti-Christ in the kitchen yellin' at me again
Yeah I can hear that
Been saved again by the garbage truck
I got something to say you know
But nothing comes
Yes I know what you think of me
You never shut-up
Yeah I can hear that
But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his
With her name still on it
Hey but I don't care
Cause sometimes
I said sometime I hear my voice
  And it's been   here
So you found a girl
Who thinks really deep thougts
What's so amazing about really deep thoughts
Boy you best pray that I bleed real soon
How's that thought for you
My scream got lost in a paper cup
You think there's a heaven
Where some screams have gone
I got 25 bucks and a cracker
Do you think it's enough
To get us there
But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his
With her name still on it
Hey but I don't care
Cause sometimes
I said sometime I hear my voice
  And it's been   here
Silent All These 
Years go by
Will I still be waiting
 For somebody else to un - derstand
Years go by
If I'm stripped of my beauty
And the orange clouds
Raining  in   my head
Years go by
Will I choke on my tears
Till finally there is not - hing left
One more casualty
You know we're too easily  easily  easilyy
Well I love the way we communicate
Your eyes focus on my funny lip shape
Let's hear what you think of me now
But baby don't look up
The sky is falling
Your mother shows up in a nasty dress
It's your turn now to stand where I stand
Everybody lookin' at you here
Take hold of my hand
Yeah I can hear them
But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his
With her name still on it
Hey but I don't care
Cause sometimes
I said sometime I hear my voice
  I hear my voice 
  And it's been   here
I've been 
   here

Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation with this black-haired flamenco dancer
She dances while his father plays guitar.  She's suddenly beautiful
We all want something beautiful, I wish I was beautiful
So come dance this silence down through the morning
        Sha la la la la la la la  yeah          uh huh...
  Cut up, Maria!  Show me some of them Spanish dances
  Pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones
  Believe in me.  Help me believe in anything
'Cause I want to be someone who believes
Mr. Jones and me tell each other fairy tales
 Stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you.  Ah, no, no, she's looking at me.""
Smiling in the bright lights, coming through in stereo
When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely
I will paint my picture.  Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
  All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful
(you know) Gray is my favorite color I felt so symbolic yesterday
  If I knew Picasso I would buy myself a gray guitar and play
Mr. Jones and me look into the future
 Stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you.  Uh, I don't think so.  She's looking at me.""
Standing in the spotlight I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody loves me, I will never be lonely
I will never be lonely
I will never be lonely
  I want to be a lion.  Everybody wants to pass as cats
  We All want to be big, big stars, but we got different reasons for that.
  Believe in me because I don't believe in anything
And I want to be someone to believe, to believe, to believe.
Mr. Jones and me stumbling through the barrio
Yeah we stare at the beautiful women
""She's perfect for you, man, there's got to be somebody for me.""
 I want to be Bob Dylan
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
When everybody loves you, son, that's just about as funky as you can be.
 Mr. Jones and me staring at the video
When I look at the television, I want to see me staring right back at me.
We all want to be big stars, but we don't know why, and we don't know how.
But when everybody loves me, I'm going to be just about as happy as I can be.
Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars.....

Stopped a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice, no

His girl took a week's worth of valium and slept

Thinks about her now and how he never really wept, he said

And that's where he will stay
Wind on the weathervane
Tearing blue eyes sailor mean
As Falstaff sings a sorrowful refrain
For a boy on Fiddler's Green
His tiny knotted heart
Well I guess it never worked too good 
The timber tore apart
And the water gorged the wood
You can hear her whispered prayer
For men at masts that always lean
The same wind that moves her hair
Moves her boy through Fiddler's Green
Oh, nothing's changed anyway
Oh, nothing's changed anyway
Anytime today
He doesn't know a soul 
And there's nowhere that he's really been
But he won't travel long alone
No not on Fiddler's Green

As children's eyes turn sleepy mean
And Falstaff sings a sorrowful refrain

I can see your disco, disco dick
Is sucking my heart out of my mind
I'm outta time, I'm outta fucking time
I'm a gasoline gut with a Vaseline mind, but
Wanna disco? Wanna see me disco?
Let me hear you depoliticize my rhyme
(One, two, three, four)
You got what you been asking for
Your so policy free and your fantasy wheels
And everything you think and everything you feel
Is alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
I take you home, now watch me get you hot
Your just a parrot when your screaming and your shouting
""More crackers, please!  More crackers, please!""
You want what you want but you don't wanna be on your knees
Who does your, who does your hair?
Who took the bomp from the bomp-a-lomp-a-lomp?
Who took the ram from the rama-lama-ding-dong?
Who took the bomp from the bomp-a-lomp-a-lomp?
Who took the ram from the rama-lama-ding-dong?
 ""How are you?""
""Fine, thank you?""
 ""How are you?""
""Fine, thank you?""
You bought a new van the first year of your band
You're cool and I hardly wanna say ""not""
Because I'm so bored
That I'd be entertained even by a stupid floor
A linoleum floor, linoleum floor
Your lyrics are dumb like a linoleum floor
I'll walk on it, I'll walk all over you
Walk on it, walk on it, walking one, two
(Who? Who? Who? Who?)
Who took the bomp from the bomp-a-lomp-a-lomp?
Who took the ram from the rama-lama-ding-dong?
Who took the bomp from the bomp-a-lomp-a-lomp?
Who took the ram from the rama-lama-ding-dong?
     ""See you later""

49,Someday Ill Be Saturday Night (ver 3),Bon Jovi,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bon-jovi/someday-ill-be-saturday-night-chords-96153,"Hey man, I'm alive
I'm taking each day a night at a time
I'm feeling like a Monday
but someday I'll be Saturday night
Hey, my name is Jim, where did I go wrong?
My life's a bargain basement, all the good shit's gone
I just can't hold a job, where do I belong?
Been sleeping in my car, my dreams move on
My name is Billy Jean, my love was bought and sold
I'm only sixteen, I feel a hundred years old
My foster daddy went, took my innocence away
The street life ain't much better, but at least I get paid
And Tuesday just might go my way
It can't get worse than yesterday
Thursdays, Fridays ain't been kind
But somehow I'll survive
Hey man, I'm alive, I'm takin' each day and night at a time
Yeah, I'm down, but I know I'll get by
Hey hey hey, hey man, gotta live my life
Like I ain't got nothin' but this roll of the dice
I'm feelin' like a Monday, but someday I'll be Saturday night
Now I can't say my name, or tell you where I am
I want to blow myself away, don't know if I can
I wish that I could be in some other time and place
With someone else's soul, someone else's face
And Tuesday just might go my way
It can't get worse than yesterday
Thursdays, Fridays ain't been kind
But somehow I'll survive
Hey man, I'm alive, I'm takin' each day and night at a time
Yeah, I'm down, but I know I'll get by
Hey hey hey, hey man, gotta live my life
I'm gonna pick up all the pieces and what's left of my pride
I'm feelin' like a Monday, but someday I'll be Saturday night
        Saturday night ... here we go ...
Some day I'll be Saturday night
I'll be back on my feet, I'll be doin' alright
It may not be tomorrow baby, that's okay
I ain't going down, gonna find a way, hey hey hey
Hey man, I'm alive, I'm taking each day and night at a time
Yeah, I'm down, but I know I'll get by
Hey hey hey, hey man, gotta live my life
Like I ain't got nothin' but this roll of the dice
I'm feelin' like a Monday, but someday I'll be Saturday night
I'm feelin' like a Monday, but someday I'll be Saturday night
Saturday night..... all right, all right
Saturday night....!

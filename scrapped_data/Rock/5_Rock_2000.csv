0,What Ive Done (ver 3),Linkin Park,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/linkin-park/what-ive-done-chords-746410,"In this farewell
There’s no blood
There’s no alibi
‘Cause I’ve drawn regret
From the truth
Of a thousand lies
So let mercy come
And wash away
What I’ve done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I’ve become
Erase myself
And let go of what I’ve done
Put to rest
What you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands
Of uncertainty
So let mercy come
And wash away
What I’ve done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I’ve become
Erase myself
And let go of what I’ve done
For what I’ve done
I’ll start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I’m forgiving what I’ve … 
Done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I’ve become
Erase myself
And let go of what I’ve done
                        What I’ve done
Forgiving what I’ve done

Your demons and all the non-believers
The plans that they have made?

Would you be the savior of the broken
The beaten and the damned??

And through it all, the rise and fall
The bodies in the streets

We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on

From decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back
Let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end, we hear the call

And though you're dead and gone, believe me

And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches
On and on we carry through the fears. (Ahh Ahh Ahh)
Disappointed faces of your peers. (Ahh Ahh Ahh)

Do or die, you'll never make me
 Because the world, will never take my heart.
Go and try, you'll never break me
 We want it all, we wanna play this part.
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scars
Give a cheer, for all the broken.
Listen here, because it's who we are.
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy who had to sing this song
Just a man, I'm not a hero
I   don't   care!
We'll carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone, believe me
Your memory will carry on, we'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches on

I missed your skin when you were east
You clicked your heels and wished for me
Through playful lips made of yarn
That fragile Capricorn
Unraveled words like moths upon old scarves
I know the world's a broken bone
But melt your headaches, call it home

We didn't have no internet, but man I never will forget
The way the moonlight shined upon her hair

Sippin' whisky out the bottle not thinkin' 'bout tomorrow
Singin' sweet home alabama all summer long

Catchin' walleye from the dock watchin' waves roll off the rocks
She'll forever hold a spot inside my soul

To hit that sandy place of rock 'n roll

Singin' sweet home alabama all summer long

Why does every moment have to be so hard

I may not make it through the night

Built up so much it crushed us every day

And so I drew a new face and laughed

   But two eggs don't last
   Like the feeling of what he needs
   Now this place seems familiar to him

  But it's starting to all make sense

  Are following me in my desperate endeavor
  To find my whoever, whoever she may be
  I'm not coming back, I've done something so terrible
  I'm terrified to speak, but you'd expect that from me

  Washing you out of my hair and out of my mind
  Keeping an eye on the world
  So many thousands of feet off the ground

Or tunnels to gates of white

Illuminate the ""no's"", on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you, when your soul embarks
Then I will follow you into the dark

As vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised
By a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me, ""son, fear is the heart of love.""

From Bangkok to Calgary
Are all worn down, the time for sleep is now
But it's nothing to cry about
Because we'll hold each other soon, in the blackest of rooms
If heaven and hell decide, that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the ""no's"", on their vacancy signs

 Yeah, missed you

You're  just so  scared to lose 
And you say,         stay
 You say,  I only hear what I want to

sa tuwing tayo'y magkasama
Bakit pa kailangan ng rosas
kung marami namang mag-aalay sayo
uupo nalang at aawit
maghihintay ng pagkakataon
Hahayaan na lang silang
Magkandarapa na manligaw sayo
Idadaan na lang kita sa awitin kong ito
Sabay ang tugtog ng gitara...ohhh
Idadaan na lang sa gitara
Mapapagod lang sa kakatingin
Kung marami namang nakaharang
Aawit na lang at magpaparinig
Ng lahat ng aking nadarama
Pagbibigyan na lang silang
Magkandarapa na manligaw sayo
Idadaan na lang kita sa awitin kong ito
Sabay ang tugtog ng gitara...ohhh
Idadaan na lang sa gitara

49,Two Birds (ver 2),Regina Spektor,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/regina-spektor/two-birds-chords-921754,"Two birds on a wire
One tries to fly away
And the other
Watches him close
From that wire
He says he wants to as well
But he is a liar
I'll believe it all
There's nothing I won't understand
I'll believe it all
I won't let go of your hand
Two birds on a wire
One says ""Come on""
And the other says
""I'm tired""
The sky is overcast
And I'm sorry
One more or one less
Nobody's worried
I'll believe it all
There's nothing I won't understand
I'll believe it all
I won't let go of your hand
Two birds of a feather
Say that they're always
Gonna stay together
But one's never goin' to
Let go of that wire
He says that he will
But he's just a liar
Two birds on a wire
One tries to fly away
And the other
Watches him close
From that wire
He says he wants to as well
But he is a liar
Two birds on a wire
One tries to fly away
And the o-ther

0,Time After Time (ver 4),Cyndi Lauper,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/cyndi-lauper/time-after-time-chords-1054329,"Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick,
and think of you
Caught up in circles confusion,
is nothing new
Flashback warm nights;
almost left behind
Suitcase of memories,
time after . .  
Sometimes you picture me, 
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear,
what you ve said 
Then you say go slow; 
I fall behind 
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost you can look and you will find me;
time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting;
time after time
If you're lost you can look and you will find me;
time after time
If you fall I will catch you I will be waiting; 
time after time
After my picture fades and darkness has, 
turned to gray
Watching through windows you're wondering,
if I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside;
the drum beats out of time 
If you're lost you can look and you will find me;
time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting;
time after time
You say go slow; 
I fall behind 
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost you can look and you will find me;
time after time
If you fall I will catch you I will be waiting; 
time after time
If you're lost you can look and you will find me;
time after time
If you fall I will catch you I will be waiting; 
time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time

Waiting for someone to tell you everything
Sit around and wonder what tomorrow will bring

Maybe somewhere down the road when somebody plays

4,Because The Night,Patti Smith,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/patti-smith/because-the-night-chords-84617,"Take me now, baby, here as I am.
Pull me close try and understand.
Desire is hunger, is the fire I breathe.
Love is a banquet on which we feed.
Come on now, try and understand
the way I feel when I'm in your hand.
Take my hand; come under cover.
They can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now.
Because the night belongs to lovers.
Because the night belongs to lust.
Because the night belongs to lovers.
Because the night belongs to us.
Have I doubt when I'm alone?
Love is a ring on the telephone.
Love is an angel disguised as lust,
here in our bed until the morning comes.
Come on now, try and understand
the way I feel under your command.
Take my hand as the sun descends.
They can't touch you now, can't touch you now, can't touch you now.
Because the night belongs to lovers.
Because the night belongs to lust.
Because the night belongs to lovers.
Because the night belongs to us.
With love we sleep; with doubt the vicious circle turns and burns.
Without you I cannot live, forgive the yearning burning.
I believe it's time, too real to feel.
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now.
Because the night belongs to lovers.
Because the night belongs to lust.
Because the night belongs to lovers.
Because the night belongs to us.
Because tonight there are two lovers.
If we believe in the night we trust
Because the night belongs to lovers.
Because the night belongs to us.

  I feel it in the air, the summer's out of reach.
Empty lake, empty streets, the sun goes down alone.
  I'm driving by your house, though I know you're not home.
But I can see you, your brown skin shining in the sun.
You got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on, baby.
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone.
   I never will forget those nights, I wonder if it was a dream.
  Remember how you made me crazy, remember how I made you scream.
  Now I don't understand what happened to our love.
But babe, I'm gonna get you back, I'm gonna show you what I'm made of.
I can see you, your brown skin shining in the sun.
I see you walkin' real slow and smiling to everyone.
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone.
   Out on the road today I saw a Deadhead Sticker on a Cadillac.
  A little voice inside my head said: ""Don't look back, you can never look back.""
  I thought I knew what love was. What did I know?
  Those days are gone forever, I should just let 'em go, but
I can see you, your brown skin shining in the sun.
You got the top pulled down and radio on, baby.
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone.
I can see you, your brown skin shining in the sun.
You got your hair slicked back and those Wayfarers on, baby.
I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone.

but it was long ago.
Janey was lovely; she was the queen of my nights,
there in the darkness with the radio, playing low.
the mountains that we moved
Caught like wildfire out of control,
till there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove.
And I remember what she said to me,
how she swore that it never would end.
I remember how she held me,  oh so tight.
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then.
Against the wind, we were running against the wind.
We were young and strong, we were running against the wind.
And the years rolled slowly past. 
And I found myself alone.
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends,
I found myself further and further from my home.
There were oh, so many roads.
I was living to run, and running to live,
never worrying about paying, or even how much I owed.
Runnin' 8 miles a minute for months at a time,
breaking all of the rules that would bend.
I begin to find myself just searching,
searching for shelter again and again.
Against the wind,  a little something against the wind.
I found myself seeking shelter against the wind.
Well those drifter's days are past me now,
I've got so much more to think about.
Deadlines and commitments;
what to leave in, what to leave out.
Against the wind,
I'm still running against the wind.
I'm older now but still running against the wind.
Well, I'm older now but still running against the wind.
Against the wind
Against the wind
Against the wind (still running)
Against the wind (I m still running against the wind)

You sit around getting older, there's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake the world off my shoulders, come on baby the laugh's on me
Stay on the streets of this town and they'll be carving you up all right
They say you gotta stay hungry, hey baby I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action, I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write this book
I need a love reaction, come on now baby gimme just one look
You can't start a fire sitting round crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire   even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire   even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark

With a baby in her hand
Under an old street light
Near a garbage can

She hates her life and what she's done to it

Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet, Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready, Are you ready for this
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip, to the sound of the beat
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone, Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
How do you think I'm going to get along, Without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had, And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied
How long can you stand the heat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip, to the sound of the beat

You can beat him, You can cheat him, You can treat him bad and leave him
When he's down
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip, Repeating to the sound of the beat, oh yeah

When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong
Into the boundary
Of each married man
Sweet deceit comes calling
And negativity lands
Cold cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things look better baby
Just passing through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts living
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all
Mutual misunderstanding
After the fact
Sensitivity builds a prison
In the final act
We lose direction
No stone unturned
No tears to damn you
When jealousy burns
Cold cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things look better baby
Just passing through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word
It's two hearts living
In two separate worlds
But it's no sacrifice
No sacrifice
It's no sacrifice at all
Cold cold heart
Hard done by you
Some things look better baby
Just passing through
And it's no sacrifice
Just a simple word

Are home now for me
But my home is the low lands
And always will be
Someday you'll return to
Your valleys and your farms
And you'll no longer burn
To be brothers in arms
Through these fields of destruction
Baptisms of fire
I've witnessed your suffering
As the battle raged higher
And though they did hurt me so bad
In the fear and alarm
You did not desert me
My brothers in arms
There's so many different worlds
So many different suns
And we have just one world
But we live in different ones
Now the sun's gone to hell
And the moon's riding high
Let me bid you farewell
Everyman has to die
But its written in the starlight
And every line in your palm
We're fools to make war
On our brothers in arms

Saw a train set the night on fire

Shining steel tempered in the fire

Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
Jimmy Rogers on the Victrola up high
Mama's dancing - baby on her shoulder
The sun is setting like molasses in the sky
The boy could sing, knew how to move  -  everything
   Always wanting more - it leaves you longing for
Black Velvet in that little boy's smile
Black Velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
Black Velvet   -   if you please
Up in Memphis the music's like a heatwave
White lightning, bound to drive you wild
Mama's baby's in the heart of every school girl
""Love Me Tender"" leaves 'em cryin' in the aisles
 The way he moved, it was a sin, so sweet and true
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for

Black Velvet with that slow southern style
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees

In a flash he was gone  -  it happened so soon    -    what could you do?

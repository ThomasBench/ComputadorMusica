0,Retrovertigo (ver 3),Mr. Bungle,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/mr-bungle/retrovertigo-chords-914297,"Before you advertise
All the fame is implied
With no fortune unseen
Sell the rights
To your blight
Time-machine
While I'm dulled by excess
And a cynic at best
My art imitates crime
Paid for by
The allies
So invest
Now I'm finding truth is a ruin
Nauseous end that nobody is pursuing
Staring  into  glassy eyes
Mesmerized
There's a vintage thirst returning
But I'm sheltered by my channel-surfing
Every famine virtual
Retrovertigo
A tribute to false memories
With conviction
Cheap imitation
Is it fashion or disease?
Post-ironic
Remains a mouth to feed
Sell the rights
To your blight
And you'll eat
Now I'm finding truth is a ruin
Nauseous end that nobody is pursuing
Staring into  glassy eyes
Mesmerized
See the vintage robot wearied
Then awakened by revision theories
Every famine virtual
Retrovertigo

It's kinda hard bein Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, I somehow, some way
Keep comin up funky ass shit nearly every single day
And, can I kick a little something, mmm, for the G's
and, make a few friends as I breeze through
Don't you know it's two in the mornin' and our party's still jumpin'
 Cause my momma ain't ho-ome
I got bitches in the living room gettin' it on
and they ain't leavin' til six in the mornin' so
 what you wanna do
I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But, but what, we don't love them whores
And we gonna smoke a ounce to that
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back with my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back with my mind on my money and my money on my mind, y'all
 I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got their cup, but they ain't chipped in
You know, this type of shit happens all the time
You gotta get yours before I get mine
Everything is fine when you listenin' to the D-O-G
He's got the cultivating music that be captivating me
But, a who, who hears the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
I started mackin' with this bitch named Sadie
You know, she used to be the homeboy's lady
Don't you know it's eighty degrees when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-Ts cause you gets none of these, at ease
 as I mob with the Dogg Pound, feel the breeze
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back with my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back with my mind on my money and my money on my mind, y'all
So Later on that day
 My homey Dr. Dre
He came by with a gang of Tanqueray
 And a fat ass J,
of some bubonic chronic, you know it made me choke
It ain't no joke, I had to back up off it,
Set my cup of gin down, Don't you know
Tanqueray and chronic, well I'm fucked up now
But it ain't stoppin', I'm still poppin'
Dr. Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me, not with a cherry on top
Cause when I bust my nut, you know I'm ragin to pop a cop
But Don't get upset girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you hoes, that's why I'm out the door
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back with my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo, sippin' on gin and juice
Laid back with my mind on my money and my money on my mind, y'all

You said you never heard of them
How cool is that??
So I went to your room and read your diary:
""watching Grunge leg-drop New-Jack trough presstable...""

I'm a lot like you so please Hello, I'm here, I'm waiting
I think I'd be good for you and you'd be good for me
How stupid is it? I can't talk about it
I gotta sing about it and make a record of (my heart)
How stupid is it? won't you gimme a minute
just come up to me and say ""hello"" to (my heart)
How stupid is it? For all I know you want me too
And maybe you just don't know what to do
Or maybe you're scared to say: ""I'm falling for you""
I wish I could get my head out of the sand
'Cuz I think we'd make a good team
And you would keep my fingernails clean
But that's just a stupid dream that I won't realize
'Cuz I can't even look in your eyes Without shakin', and I ain't fakin'

Been up before the sun and now I'm tired before I even begin
(Now you're flying) I got so much work in front of me
(Really flying) It stretches out far as the eye can see
I can see
Spent half my life in airports doing crosswords or attempting to sleep
And when the bar is open then you'll often find me warming a seat
(Now you're flying) I never find a place where I can stay
(Really flying) I'd rather be a thousand miles away
A thousand miles away
Working for yourself sometimes ain't all that it's cracked up to be
It can be as lonely at the top as at the bottom of that corporate tree
(Now you're flying) I'm told I'm going places who can say
(Really flying) I might arrive but I'll be gone the very next day
I must be on my way, 
a thousand miles away
I promise to myself someday I'll take the time and try to make sense
Out of all those opportunities I've lost I'm trying to sit on the fence
(Now you're flying) Right now I got no time for yesterday
(Really flying) Yesterday's a thousand miles away, 
a thousand miles away (a thousand miles away)
a thousand miles away (a thousand miles away)
(Now you're flying) What was that you were trying to say
I guess I was a thousand miles away, hey hey hey, hey hey hey, yeah
A thousand miles away

Sing it again, a thousand miles away

And an eeriness surrounded me
Oh boy you are so pretty
And when I finally kissed him
Lost like a bell that's tipping over
knew the world was over
And watched the fires that were reaching up
And the waiting scene and the sunday dream
Deli markets and the flower stands
Hanging out on the hooks next to window displays
Across a bridge and across the mountains
To save my soul from all these troubled times
Always sober
And wasted gas station attendants
And a nice drive in the country
And this life just gets so grating
Take those pills your boyfriend gave you
And the last one tore a picture
And it's a lie that you've been given
So why should I lay here naked
we could call love,
So I'll sleep out in the gutter
And when I wake up in the morning
Cause with a match that's mean and some gasoline

Che non ero bambino
Che non ero neanche un' età
Quando un giorno di scuola
Mi durava una vita
E il mio mondo finiva un po là
Tra quel prete palloso
Che ci dava da fare
E il pallone che andava
Come fosse a motore
C'era chi era incapace a sognare
E chi sognava già
Ho imparato a sognare
E ho iniziato a sperare
Che chi c'ha avere avrà
Ho imparato a sognare
Quando un sogno è un cannone,
Che se sogni
Ne ammazzi metà
Quando inizi a capire
Che sei solo e in mutante
Quando inizi a capire
Che tutto è più grande
C' era chi era incapace a sognare
E chi sognava già
Tra una botta che prendo
E una botta che dò
Tra un amico che perdo
E un amico che avrò
Che se cado una volta
Una volta cadrò
E da terra, da lì m'alzerò
C'è che ormai che ho imparato a sognare non smetterò
Tra una botta che prendo
E una botta che dò
Tra un amico che perdo
E un amico che avrò
Che se cado una volta
Una volta cadrò
E da terra, da lì m'alzerò

Standing in the shelter out of the rain
She tucked a note into his hand
Later on they took his car
Drove on down where the beaches are
He wrote her name in the sand
Never even let go of her hand
Somehow they stayed that way
For those 5 days in May
Made all the stars around them shine
Funny how you can look in vain
Living on nerves and such sweet pain
The loneliness that cuts so fine
To find the face you've seen a thousand times
Sometimes the world begins
To set you up on your feet again
It wipes the tears from your eyes
How will you ever know
The way that circumstances go
Always going to hit you by surprise
I know my past
You were there
In everything I've done
 Looking back it's hard to tell
Why they stood while others fell
 Spend your life working it out
 All I know is one cloudy day
 They both just ran away
Rain on the windshield heading south
She loved the lines around his mouth
Sometimes the world begins
To set you up on your feet again
It wipes the tears from your eyes
How will you ever know
The way that circumstances go
Always going to hit you by surprise
I know my past
You were there
In everything I've done
You are the one

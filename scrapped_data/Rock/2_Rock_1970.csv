0,Fire And Rain (ver 4),James Taylor,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/james-taylor/fire-and-rain-chords-1045012,"Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone 
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you 
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song 
I just can't remember who to send it to 
I've seen fire and I've seen rain 
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end 
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend 
But I always thought that I'd see you again 
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus 
You've got to help me make a stand 
You've just got to see me through another day 
My body's aching and my time is at hand 
And I won't make it any other way 
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain 
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end 
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend 
But I always thought that I'd see you again 
Been walking my mind to an easy time, my back turned towards the sun 
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around 
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line to talk about things to come 
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground 
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain 
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end 
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend 
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby, one more time again 
Thought I'd see you one more time again 
There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now 
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you fire and rain, now . . .

1,Life On Mars (ver 8),David Bowie,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/david-bowie/life-on-mars-chords-1237810,"It's a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
   But her mummy is yelling ""No""
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen
Now she walks through her sunken dream.
To the seat with the clearest view
But the film is a saddening bore
For she's lived it ten times or more
She could spit in the eyes of fools
As they ask her to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
   He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?
It's on Amerika's tortured brow
That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
Now the workers have struck for fame
'Cause Lennon's on sale again
See the mice in their million hordes
From Ibeza to the norfolk broads
Rule Britannia is out of bounds
But the film is a saddening bore
For I've writ it ten times or more
It's about to be writ again
As I ask you to focus on
Sailors fighting in the dance hall
Oh man! look at those cavemen go
It's the freakiest show
Take a look at the lawman
Beating up the wrong guy
Oh man! Wonder if he'll ever know
   He's in the best selling show
Is there life on Mars?

   Tight pants, points, hardly renown
   She was a black haired beauty with big dark eyes
   And points all her own sittin' way up high             way up firm and high
   Out past the cornfields, where the woods got heavy
   Out in the backseat of my sixty Chevy
   Workin on mysteries without any clues
   Working on our night moves
   Tryin' to make some    front page drive-in news
   Workin' on our night moves           in the summertime      hmm
   In the sweet, summertime
   We weren't in love, oh no, far from it
   We weren't searching for some high in the sky summit
   We were just young and restless and bored      living by the sword
   And we'd steal away every chance we could 
   To the back room, alley, or the trusty woods
   I used her, she used me but neither one cared      we were getting our share
   Working on our night moves
   Tryin' to lose the    awkward teenage blues 
   Workin' on our night moves         in the summertime      hmm
   In the sweet, summertime, summertime
   Oh    I wonder       felt the lightning yeah
   And waited on the thunder   waited on the thunder
   I woke last night to the sound of thunder
     How far off I sat and wondered
   Started humming a song from 1962
     Ain't it funny how the night moves

Looking on,  she sings the songs,  the words she knows, the tune she hums

Lying here, with no one near
Where only you, and you can hear me

""Slowly...""
""Hold me closer Tiny Dancer""
""Count the headlights on the highway""
""Lay me down in sheets of linen""
""You had a busy day today""

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today
     And then one day you find,   ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run ... You missed the starting gun
And you run and you run to catch up with the Sun, but it's sinking;
Racing around to come up behind you again.
The Sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older,
shorter of breath, and one day closer to death.
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time.
Plans that either come to naught, or half a page of scribbled lines.
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way.
The time is gone, the song is over. Thought I'd something more to say.
 Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
 When I come home, cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away, across the field
Tolling on the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spell

There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
This could be heaven or this could be hell
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor,
I thought I heard them say...
 Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
There's plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year, (any time of year) You can find it here...
Her mind is Tiffany twisted, She got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty pretty boys that she calls friends
How they danced in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I called up the captain; ""Please bring me my wine"" (he said)
""We haven't had that spirit here since 1969""
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say...
 Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
They're livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your alibis
Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice (and she said)
We are all just prisoners here, of our own device
And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives, but they
Just can't kill the beast

I had to find the passage back to the place I was before

Nothin' to show but this brand new tattoo
   But it's a real beauty, a Mexican cutie
How it got here I haven't a clue
   Wastin' away again in Margaritaville,        searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
   Some people claim that there's a woman to blame, now I think, hell it could be my fault
   I blew out my flip flop, stepped on a pop top
Cut my heel had to cruise on back home
   But there's booze in the blender, and soon it will render
That frozen concoction that helps me hang on
   Wastin' away again in Margaritaville,        searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
   Some people claim that there's a woman to blame, but I know, it's my own damn fault
Yes and,   some people claim that there's a woman to blame, and I know, it's my own damn fault

47,Smoke On The Water (ver 2),Deep Purple,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/deep-purple/smoke-on-the-water-chords-1088508,"We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, and fire in the sky
Smoke on the water
They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
A funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids outa the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, and fire in the sky
Smoke on the water
We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this
I know, I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, and fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

For so long (so long) where did we go wrong.

Spending someone's hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving
Not arriving on our way back home
We're on our way home

Writing letters on my  wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches on our way back home

Longer than the road that stretches out ahead
Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo in the sun

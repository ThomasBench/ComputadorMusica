0,Jack And Diane,John Mellencamp,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-mellencamp/jack-and-diane-chords-208477,"A little ditty bout Jack and Diane
Two American kids grown up in the heartland
Jack, he's gonna be a football star
Diane debutante, back seat of Jacky's car
Suckin' on chili dog outside the Tasty Freeze
Diane sittin' on Jacky's lap, he got his hands between her knees
Jacky says ""Hey Diane, lets run off behind a shady tree""
Dribble off Bobby Brooks, let me do what I please, sayin'
Ooh yeah, Life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone, sayin'
Ooh yeah, Life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone, they walk on..
Jack, he sits back, collects his thoughts for a moment
Scratches his head and does his best James Dean
""Well there Diane, we gotta run off to the city""
Diane says, ""Baby you ain't missin' nothing"", but Jacky says
Ooh yeah, Life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone, sayin'
Ooh yeah, Life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone,
Ooh yeah, Life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone, sayin'
Ooh yeah, Life goes on
Long after the thrill of livin' is gone, rock on
A little ditty bout Jack and Diane
Two American kids doin' the best they can

1,I Guess Thats Why They Call It The Blues (ver 2),Elton John,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/elton-john/i-guess-thats-why-they-call-it-the-blues-chords-1087623,"Don't wish it away
Don't look at it's like it's forever
Between you and me
I could honestly say
That things can only get better
And while I'm away,
dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long
Before you and me run
To the place in our hearts
Where we hide
And I guess that's why
they call it the blues
Time on my hands,
could be time spent with you
Laughing like children,
living like lovers,
rolling like thunder, under the covers
And I guess that's why
they call it the blues
Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second
Without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man
Wait on me girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever I simply love you
More than I love life itself
And I guess that's why
they call it the blues
Time on my hands,
could be time spent with you
Laughing like children,
living like lovers,
rolling like thunder, under the covers

Wait on me girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever I simply love you

could be time spent with you
Laughing like children,
living like lovers,
rolling like thunder, under the covers

they call it the blues
And I guess that's why
they call it the blues  2x

Wheels go round and round, you're on my mind
Restless hearts sleep alone tonight
Sending all my love along the wire
They say that the road ain't no place to start a family                 
Right down the line it's been you and me                
And lovin' a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be
Oh oh girl, you stand by me
I'm forever yours faithfully
Circus life under the big top world
We all need the clowns to make us smile
Through space and time, always another show
Wondering where I am, lost without you
And being apart ain't easy on this love affair  
Two strangers learn to fall in love again       
I get the joy of rediscovering you
Oh oh girl, you stand by me
I'm forever yours faithfully
Oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh, Oh oh oh oh Oh Oh
Faithfully, I'm still yours

These city walls, only to be with you.
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for.
I have kissed honey lips, felt the healing fingertips
It burned like fire, this burning desire.
I have spoke with the tongue of angels, I have held the hand of the devil
It was warm in the night, I was cold as a stone.
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for.
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for.
I believe in Kingdom Come, then all the colors will bleed into one,
Bleed into one, but yes I'm still running.
You broke the bonds and loosed the chains,
Carried the cross, of my shame, of my shame... you know I believe it.

6,Thunder Road (ver 7),Bruce Springsteen,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bruce-springsteen/thunder-road-chords-1088889,"The screen door slams, Mary's dress waves
Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
Hey that's me and I want you only
Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again
Don't run back inside, darling you know just what I'm here for
That maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty, but hey you're alright
Oh and that's alright with me
You can hide neath your covers and study your pain
Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain
Waste your summer praying in vain
For a saviour to rise from these streets
Well now I'm no hero, that's understood
All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood
With a chance to make it good somehow
Hey what else can we do now?
Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair
These two lanes will take us anywhere
We got one last chance to make it real
To trade in these wings on some wheels
Climb in back heaven's waiting down on the tracks
Oh oh come take my hand
We re riding out tonight to case the promised land
Oh oh oh oh Thunder Road, oh Thunder Road, oh Thunder Road,
Lying out there like a killer in the sun
Hey I know it's late we can make it if we run
Oh oh oh oh Thunder Road, sit tight take hold, Thunder Road
Well I  got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk
From your front porch to my front seat
The door's open but the ride it ain't free
And I know you're lonely for words that I ain't spoken
But tonight we'll be free, all the promises'll be broken
There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away
In the skeleton frames of burned out Chevrolets
They scream your name at night in the street
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet and in the
Lonely cool before dawn you hear their engines roaring on but when you
Get to the porch they're gone on the wind so Mary climb in
It's a town full of losers and I'm pulling out of here to win
The screen door slams, Mary's dress waves
Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays
Roy Orbison singing for the lonely
Hey that's me and I want you only
Don't turn me home again, I just can't face myself alone again
Don't run back inside, darling you know just what I'm here for
That maybe we ain't that young anymore
Show a little faith, there's magic in the night
You ain't a beauty, but hey you're alright

to trade in these wings on some wheels,
Climb in back, heaven's waiting on down the tracks.
Ohh come take my hand; we're ridin out tonight to case the Promised Land.
Oh Thunder Road, Oh Thunder road, Oh Thunder Road.

So I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk.
And my car's out back if you're ready to take that long walk.
From your front porch to my front seat, 
Door's open but the ride ain't free.
Well I know you've been waiting for words that I ain't spoken,
Well tonight we'll be free; all the promises will be broken.
There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away.
They drive this dusty beach road, in the skeleton frames of 
burned-out Chevrolets.
They scream your name at night in the street,
Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet.
And in the lonely cool before dawn; you hear their engines roaring on;
Until you get to the porch, they're gone on the wind: so Mary climb in,
It's a town full of losers and we're pulling out of here to win.

I want you to come back and carry me home,
Away from these long, lonely nights.
I'm reaching for you. Are you feeling it too?
Does the feeling seem oh, so right?
And what would you say if I called on you now,
And said that I can't hold on?
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day,
Please love me or I'll be gone.  I'll be gone.

Sailing a reach before a following sea
She was making for the trades on the outside
And the downhill run to Papeete Bay
Off this wind on this heading lie the Marqueses
We got eighty feet of the waterline nicely making way
In a noisy bar in Avalon I tried to call you
But on a midnight watch I realized why twice you ran away
Think about
Think about how many times I have fallen
Spirits are using me, larger voices calling
What heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten
I have been around the world
Looking for that woman girl
Who knows love can endure
And you know it will
And you know it will
When you see the Southern Cross for the first time
You understand now why you came this way
Cause the truth you might be runnin' from is so small
But it's as big as the promise
The promise of a coming day
So I'm sailing for tommorrow, my dreams are a dying
And my love is an anchor tied to you
Tied with a silver chain
I have my ship and all her flags are a flying
She is all that I have left
And music is her name
Think about
Think about how many times I have fallen
Spirits are using me, larger voices calling
What heaven brought you and me cannot be forgotten
I have been around the world
Looking for that woman girl
Who knows love can endure
And you know it will
And you know it will
So we cheated and we lied and we tested
And we never failed to fail
It was the easiest thing to do
 You will survive being bested
Somebody fine will come along
Make me forget about loving you

And I was free

0,Lay Down Sally (ver 2),Eric Clapton,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/eric-clapton/lay-down-sally-chords-1403270,"There is nothing that is wrong
In wanting you to stay here with me.
I know you've got somewhere to go,
stay with me? And don't you ever leave.
Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms.
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon.
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you.
The sun ain't nearly on the rise
And we still got the moon and stars above.
Underneath the velvet skies,
Love is all that matters. Won't you stay with me?
And don't you ever leave.
Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms.
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon.
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you.
I long to see the morning light
Coloring your face so dreamily.
So don't you go and say goodbye,
You can lay your worries down and stay with me.
And don't you ever leave.
Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms.
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, there's no need to leave so soon.
I've been trying all night long just to talk with you.
Lay down, Sally, and rest here in my arms.
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?
Lay down, Sally, there's no need to leave so soon.
I've been trying all night long just to talk with you.

with a girl named Linda Lou 
When in walked a man with a gun in his hand,
he was looking for you know who. 
He said ""Hey there fellow with the hair coloured yellow, 
   watcha tryin' to prove? 
Cuz thatsa my woman there and I'm a man who cares 
and this might be all for you""  (I said ""excuse me!"")
I was scared and fearing for my life,
I was shaking like a leaf on a tree 
Cuz he was lean and mean and big and bad, Lord, 
a pointing that gun at me 
""Oh wait a minute mister, I didn't even kiss her, 
   don't want no trouble with you 
and I know you don't owe me but I wish you would let me 
ask one favor from you
Oh, won't you gimme three steps, gimme three steps mister, 
gimme three steps toward the door? 
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps mister 
and you'll never see me no more. For sure""
Oh, well the crowd cleared away and I began to pray 
and the water fell on the floor.
And I'm telling you, son, well it ain't no fun, 
staring straight down a forty-four. 
Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lou, 
and that's the break I was looking for 
and you could hear me screaming a mile away 
as I was headed out toward the door. 
Oh, won't you gimme three steps, gimme three steps mister, 
gimme three steps toward the door? 
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps mister

you said that you had no doubt that deep down we were really in love

And the bright lights have faded to blue
I was thinkin' 'bout a woman who might have loved me
And I never knew
You know I've always been a dreamer Spent my life running round
And it's so hard to change Can't seem to settle down
But the dreams I've seen lately
Keep turnin' out and burnin' out & turnin' out the same
So put me on a highway & show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time
You can spend all your time making money
You can spend all your love making time
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow would you still be mine
And when you're looking for your freedom nobody seems to care
And you can't find the door, can't find it anywhere
When there's nothin' to believe in
Still you're commin' back, you're runnin' back, you're commin' back for more
So put me on a highway & show me a sign
And take it to the limit one more time
Take it to the limit,  take it to the limit
Take it to the limit one more time
You can take it to the limit, yes take it to the limit 
One more time.

So lonely, so lonely, so lonely! So lonely, so lonely, so lonely!
So lonely, so lonely, so lonely! So lonely, so lonely, so lonely!
Now no one´s knocked upon my door
    For a thousand years or more.
    All made up and nowhere to go,
  Welcome to this one man show.
   Just take a seat, they´re always free,
    no surprise, no mystery.
In this theatre that I call my soul
I always play the starring role. So lonely!
So lonely, so lonely, so lonely! So lonely, so lonely, so lonely!
So lonely, so lonely, so lonely! So lonely, so lonely, so lonely!
                             So lonely

Said he couldn't go on the American way
Closed the shop, sold the house
Bought a ticket to the West Coast
Now he gives them a stand-up routine in L.A.
I don't need you to worry for me cause I'm alright
   I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life
   Go ahead with your own life, and leave me alone
I never said you had to offer me a second chance
  I never said I was a victim of circumstance
  I still belong,     don't get me wrong
  And you can speak your mind
But not  on  my   time
They will tell you you can't sleep
Alone in a strange place
Then they'll tell you you can't sleep with somebody else
But sooner or later you sleep
In your own space
Either way it's okay to wake up with yourself
I don't need you to worry for me cause I'm alright
   I don't want you to tell me it's time to come home
I don't care what you say anymore, this is my life

Teach your children well,
Their fathers hell, did slowly go by
And feed, them on your dreams
The one they picks, the one you’ll know by.
Don’t you ever ask them why,
If they told you, you would cry,
So just look at them and sigh,
And know they love you.

Can’t know the fears, that your elders grew by
And so please help,                them with your youth,
They seek the truth,      before they can die,
Teach, your parents well,
Their children’s hell, will slowly go by.

Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Hope it don't rain all day
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like jelly roll
And it stoned me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like going home
And it stoned me
And the rain let up, and the sun came up, and we were getting dry
  Almost let a pickup truck nearly pass us by
So we jumped right in and the driver grinned
And he dropped us up the road
And we looked at the swim, and we jumped right in
Not to mention fishing poles
Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Oh, the water
Let it run all over me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like jelly roll
And it stoned me
And it stoned me to my soul
Stoned me just like going home
And it stoned me
On the way back home we sang a song, but our throats were getting dry
Then we saw the man from across the road with the sunshine in his eyes
Well he lived all alone in his own little home with a great big gallon jar
There were bottles too, one for me and you, and he said ""hey, there you are""
Oh, the water

Oh, the water
Get it myself from the mountain stream

 News had just come over,                     we had five years left to cry in
 News guy wept and told us,                   earth was really dying
 Cried so much his face was wet,              then I knew he was not lying
 I heard telephones, opera house, favorite melodies
 I saw boys, toys, electric irons and T.V.'s
 My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
 I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
 And all the fat-skinny people, 
 and all the tall-short people,
 and all the nobody people, 
 and all the somebody people
 I never thought I'd need so many people
 A girl my age went off her head,            hit some tiny children
 If the black hadn't a-pulled her off,       I think she would have killed them
 A soldier with a broken arm,                fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
 A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest,and a queer Threw up at the sight of that
 I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlor,   drinking milk shakes cold and long
 Smiling and waving and looking so fine,     don't think You knew you were in this song
 And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor
 And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
 Your face, your race, the way that you talk
 I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

Not a chill to the winter but a nip to the air,
From the other direction she was calling my eye,
Could be an illusion but I might as well try, might as well try.
She had rings on her fingers and bells on her shoes,
And I knew without askin' she was into the blues.
She wore scarlet begonias tucked into her curls,
I knew right away she was not like other girls, other girls.
In the heat of the evening when the dealin' got rough,
She was too pat to open and too cool to bluff.
As I picked up my matches and was closin' the door,
I had one of those flashes, I'd been there before, been there before.
Well, I ain't often right but I've never been wrong,
Seldom turns out the way it does in the song.
Once in a while you get shown the light
In the strangest of places if you look at it right.
Well, there ain't nothin' wrong with the way she moves,
Her scarlet begonias or a touch of the blues.
And there's nothing wrong with the look that's in her eyes
I had to learn the hard way to let her pass by, let her pass by.

44,Doctor My Eyes (ver 2),Jackson Browne,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jackson-browne/doctor-my-eyes-chords-181431,"Thump on E bass note between single chord strums
Doctor, my eyes have seen the years
And the slow parade of fears without crying
Now I want to understand
I have done all that I could, to see the evil and the good
without hiding.  You must help me if you can
Doctor, my eyes, tell me what is wrong
Was I unwise to leave them open for so long
'Cause I have wandered through this world
And as each moment has unfurled,  I've been waiting
to awaken from these dreams
People go just where they will,  I never noticed them until
I got this feeling, that it's later than it seems
Doctor, my eyes, tell me what you see
I hear their cries, just say if it's too late for me
Doctor, my eyes, they cannot see the sky
Is this the price for having learned how not to cry

Suddenly the day turns into night, far away, from the city
But don't, hesitate, cause your love, won't wait

   Wanna tell you I love your way, every day
   Wanna be with you night and day

Wonder how they have, the power to shine, shine, shine

Well, another crazy day, you drink the night away
And forget about everything
This city desert makes you feel so cold, it's got
And it's taken you so long to find out you were wrong
When you thought it held everything
You used to think that it was so easy
You used to say that it was so easy
But you're tryin', you're tryin' now
Another year and then you'd be happy
Just one more year and then you'd be happy
But you're cryin', you're cryin' now
Way down the street there's a light in his place
And he asks you where you've been, you tell him who you've seen
And you talk about anything
He's got this dream about buyin' some land
And then he'll settle down, in a quiet little town
And forget about everything
But you know he'll always keep moving
You know he's never gonna stop moving
Cause he's rollin', he's the rolling stone
And when you wake up it's a new morning
The sun is shining, it's a new morning
And you're going, you're going home

Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind
Possessing and caressing me

Nothing's gonna change my world

They tumble blindly as they make their way across the Universe.

Got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in.
When I'm a good dog, they sometimes throw me a bone in.
 I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on.
Got those swollen hand blues.
Got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V. to choose from.
I've got electric light.
  And I've got second sight.
And amazing powers of observation.
And that is how I know
   When I try to get through
   On the telephone to you
         There'll be nobody home.
 I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm.
And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favourite satin shirt.
 I've got nicotine stains on my fingers.
I've got a silver spoon on a chain.
I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains.
I've got wild staring eyes.
  And I've got a strong urge to fly.
  But I got nowhere to fly to (fly to, fly to, fly to, fly to, fly to, fly to, fly to)
  Ooooh, Babe             when I pick up the phone
         There's still nobody home.
  I've got a pair of Gohills boots
  and I got fading roots.

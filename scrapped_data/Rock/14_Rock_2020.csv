How the world can look so different than we were dreamin'
It's gettin' harder to say I'm undefeated
When the best my heart can hope for is breakin' even
Here and now, reachin' out
In my hurt, I don't know how
But I know I'm not alone
   I can face my darkest night
'Cause I trust You with my life
I'm not afraid for You are my refuge
When it's heavy on my chest
You're the place I catch my breath
You are the only one I hold onto
Oh, 'cause You are my refuge
    I know how this ends
I'm gonna make it
Your Word is in my heart
None could ever take it
Here and now, hear us out
Come and fill me with Your power
Let me know I'm not alone
   I can face my darkest night
'Cause I trust You with my life
I'm not afraid for You are my refuge
When it's heavy on my chest
You're the place I catch my breath
You are the only one I hold onto
Every day and darkest night (Night)
I trust You at all times (Trust You at all times)
I'm not afraid for You are my refuge
And when I've got nothin' left (Got nothin' left)
You're the place I find my rest (Place I find my rest)
You are the only one that I run to
Yes, You are my refuge
You're my rest, You're my rock, You're my fortress
You're my strength, You're my shield and You're my defense
Nothing could ever take me from You
Nothin's ever gonna take me from You
   I can face my darkest night
'Cause I trust You with my life
I'm not afraid for You are my refuge
When it's heavy on my chest
You're the place I catch my breath
You are the only one I hold onto
Every day and darkest night (Darkest night)
I trust You at all times (Trust You at all times)
I'm not afraid for You are my refuge
And when I've got nothin' left (Got nothin' left)
You're the place I find my rest (Place I find my rest)
You are the only one that I run to
Yes, You are my refuge

1,Living My Best Life,Ben Rector,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ben-rector/living-my-best-life-chords-4019335,"  This house is now a litany
Things I thought I'd never be
A man who has opinions on an ottoman among other things
  I used to think I'd miss the road
The crushing fame and sold out shows
Now I just sing ""head shoulders knees and toes"" like I'd forgotten 'em
But I'm alive  and
Baby I'm thri-ving    (Oh yeah)
I'm living my best life
I wake up with the sunrise
It does not look a thing like I thought that it would
But I've been getting my steps in
And I sleep with my best friend
It's the best that it has  been in a long time
I'm living my best life   (Yeah)   (Yeah)
Living my best life
  Sometimes this sucks to tell the truth
And I took it hard like people do
But I'm learning how to eat the fruit that is in season
  Never thought I'd be a grown ass man
But you know what they say of best laid plans
Now I'm holding on to my daughter's hand and I've got a reason
To be alive  and    (Oh yeah)
Baby I'm thri-ving    (Yeah, yeah)
I'm living my best life
I wake up with the sunrise
It does not look a thing like I thought that it would
But I've been getting my steps in
And I sleep with my best friend
It's the best that it has  been in a long time
I'm living my best life       (Yeah)
Living my best life  (Yeah, yeah)
C'mon, I'm living my best life
The best that I can
No more worry or stress life
Cause I'm done with them
I'm as light as can be
I'm as fresh as a breeze
Right where I wanna be so
If you need to find me I'll be
Living my best life
Waking up with the sunrise
Looking at things like what the actual hell
But I've been counting my blessings
And I sleep with my best friend
It's the best that it has been for a long time
It's the best that it has been for a long time
I'm living my best life   (Yeah)   (Yeah)
Living my best life   (oooohhhh)
I've been living my, living my, living my best life

 This is where someone was meant to say
     This is nothing like they said it would be
 When everything is running out
This is love
She’s the fire and the fallout
She reminds you of the things we never talk about
She’s the lover with the best-laid plan
To break the man
She’s a sinner in a side show
She feels at home when there’s nowhere left to go
She’s the devil you understand
Break the man
     No more tearing the bandages off
 No more chewing the scenery
     No more wondering “what happens now?”
 When everything is running down
She’s the fire and the fallout
She reminds you of the things we never talk about
She’s the lover with the best-laid plan
To break the man
She’s the trouble in the headline
She’s the mother who turns back father time
She’s the devil you understand
Break the man
     No more wondering “what happens now?”
 When everything is running down
This is love
She’s the fire and the fallout
She reminds you of the things we never talk about

I never believed that I would concede and get myself blown asunder

I know how to win, before you begin I’ll shoot you before you take aim

  O faltaría de dar
  Por cual camino prohibido
    Se negaría viajar
  No existe altura de riesgo
  Que evitaría tomar

Entre las nubes sin dinero travesar
(Por su amor)
Pintar su nombre en un tranvía

Viajar a Marte él lo haría sin pensar

  Un hombre, superar
  Sus miedos más profundos
  Que suelen traicionar

No existe esfuerzo que se fuese a agotar

Ella es la luz bajo la luna
(Por su amor)
Acumulando poco a poco para ahorrar
(Por su amor)
Se ganará su adoración
  Y con toda mi fuerza
(Por su amor)
Energía y voluntad
Le daré hasta el sol y el mar
Volaré hasta el cielo y de allá
Entre cuerpos celestes del sistema solar
Y las líneas de Marte, lograré descifrar, lograre descifrar
  Que es lo que no intentaría
  Un hombre, superar

polaroids Kiss you in the kitchen
of our house that burned down
I remember waiting on the sunrise
And I'll be ready, waiting until you
come back around
Come back around
All I wanted was you let's
do whatever it takes
Me and you we can't lose
I'll take you away from here
From the city that never loved
you from the town I always hated
  Me and you we can't lose Let's go
Woah oh oh
Woah oh oh
All that
I would always fuck
You were always saying
I would crash down someday
I would have to pass out
on our friends couch
We were up all night
so we slept all day
I remember waiting
on the sunrise
And I'll be right
come back around
Come back around
All I wanted was you let's
do whatever it takes
Me and you we can't lose
I'll take you away from here
From the city that never loved
you from the town I always hated
  Me and you we can't lose Let's go
  And maybe it was for the best
you used to call me useless
We're floating to the nothingness
cause after all the truth is
The only things we leave
behind are nos and absolution
I act like everything is fine
All I wanted was you let's
Me and you we can't lose
I'll take you away from here
From the city that never loved
you from the town I always hated
  Me and you we can't lose

Los, komm, zieh bei mir ein
Verspreche dir, du willst nie wieder gehen
Du fragst mich, ob du mir vertrauen kannst
Und was ich in der sehe
Ich glaub, ich steck mein ganzes Haus in Brand
Und baue es neu für dich
Ja, ich bin so verliebt, so verliebt (Oh-oh-oh)
Es war noch nie so schlimm wie heute
So verliebt, bin so verliebt (Oh-oh-oh)

Blutrot ist unser Wein
Wir liegen vorm Kamin
Wir schlafen tags und leben nur bei Nacht
Suchen die Dunkelheit
Wollen keine Sonne sehen
Ich liebe es, ich lieb es, wenn du sorglos lachst
Wir nehmen von allem viel zu viel
Probieren jedes Gift
Ich reiß dich runter, reiß dich einfach mit
Einmal zur Hölle und zurück
Ja, ich bin so verliebt, so schlimm wie noch nie (Oh-oh-oh)
Flieg mit dir auf 'ner dunklen Wolke

 When the one you can't live without disappears before your eyes
 You can't stop thinking about how you never got to say goodbye
A scar is born

The moment when you started to grief? Believe
 Every time my heart aches
 Every time my soul breaks

 When the love's one-sided
 And you're uninvited
A scar is born, a scar is born
 When you're desperate to release what's bottled up inside
 And there's no one left to trust and there's nowhere left to hide
A scar is born
When you don't know what to believe
When you're tired of bein' deceived
And being told what life to lead
Your scar is born

The moment when you started to grief? Believe
 Every time my heart aches
 Every time my soul breaks

 And you're uninvited

Never has it cut you so deep, so deep

Heart was torn, a scar is born
 When the love's one-sided
 And you're uninvited

Single in our nature, and because of the times
Not a word was said when the lights came on
Or a glance given pause at the cost of our desired wrongs
It's second nature to love you, it's first to die
And we were killed upon waking, killed upon waking to the life
We weren't prepared to live but rebelled to realize
We were killed upon the pavement, Bonnie we're immortalized in
Blood, cold, cold love, we were still young
When the radio lights came on
Elton's on the air, no fair dear that we were still here
In the absence of everything, abstain from fear
And if I cry in your arms
Just some other shit, just some other shit
Just some other things that I've been dealing with
I'd die in your arms, bury me while playing this
Bury me saying ""You were all I ever needed""
And hold me like we're dying from the liquor that we drank
Down in hotel rooms, to feel warm in cold love
What's harder, harder to say?
That you want me to stay
That you want me to stay unchanged for you?
Chained to a lie, we're the same, you and I, we're the same
Not the same, we hurt differently, but consistent in our pain
Equal and equidistant in the way we laugh
To lay bare the weight of our cold love affair
Recalling the days where we were, we weren't, we were
Wrong for the papers, wrong for the dinner tables
Of the inner rings of the rich and famous anythings
It's gone, not bad, just gone, my bad, just wrong, we had
And we had, and we were then in
Blood, cold, cold love, we were still young
When the radio lights came on
Elton's on the air, no fair dear that we were still here
In the absence of everything, abstain from fear
And if I cry in your arms
Just some other shit, just some other shit
Just some other things that I've been dealing with

Bury me saying ""You were all I ever needed""

What's harder, harder to fake?
That you want me to stay
That you want me to stay the same for you?

maybe 20 on this Earth

Everywhere I look, it's just routine pain
I'm so sick of treading water""

Well everything lower than everything else

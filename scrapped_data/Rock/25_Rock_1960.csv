And his golden beard flows nearly down to the-

Nothing to say and nothing to hear  And nothing to see.
Each sensation makes a note in my symphony.

Gone are the days when you dreamed of that car
You just want to sit in your Shangri-La

Got a mortgage hanging over his head
But he's too scared to complain
Cos he's conditioned that way

For seven shillings a week

Same chimney pots, same little cars, same window panes

They say their lines they drink their tea and then they go
They tell your business in another Shangri-La
The gas bills and the water rates and payments on the car

Selling lamps and chairs to San Ber'dino Squares
And I still remember mama with her apron and her pad
Feeding all the boys in Ed's Cafe

Ronnie helping Kenny helping burn his poots away
And all the while on a shelf in a shed
Kenny's little creature's on display
Ronnie saves his numies on a window in his room
A marvel to be seen; dysentery green
While Kenny and his buddies had a game out in the back
LET'S MAKE THE WATER TURN BLACK!
We see them after school in a world of their own
To some it might seem creepy what they do...
The neighbors on the right sat and watched them every night
I bet you'd do the same if they was you

Then we wouldn't have to wait so long?
And wouldn't it be nice to live together,
In the kind of world where we belong?
You know its gonna make it that much better,(Oooh)

Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up,(Oooh-bupbup)
In the morning when the day is new? (Oooh-bupbup)
And after having spent the day together. (Oooh-bupbup)
Hold each other close the whole night through,
Happy times together we've been spending.
I wish that every kiss was neverending
Maybe if, we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true? (Run, run, ooh)

Ladies and gentlemen, Mama Cass...
Stars shining bright above you
Night breezes seem to whisper I love you
Birds singing in the sycamore tree
Dream a little dream of me
Say nighty- night and kiss me
Just hold me tight and tell me you’ll miss me
While I’m alone as blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me
Stars fading but I linger on dear
Still craving your kiss
I’m longing to linger til dawn dear
Just saying this
Sweet dreams til sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you
And in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me
Stars fading but I linger on dear
Still craving your kiss
I’m longing to linger til dawn dear
Just saying this
Sweet dreams til sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave all worries far behind you
And in your dreams whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me
La la la la la la- laaa…

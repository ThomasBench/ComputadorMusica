0,Dyer Wanna Be A Spaceman,Oasis,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/oasis/dyer-wanna-be-a-spaceman-chords-42761,"I haven't seen your face round since I was a kid
You're bring back the memories of these things that we did
You're hanging round and climbing trees, pretending to fly
D'yer wanna be a spaceman and live in the sky
[Verse 2]
You got how many bills to pay and how many kids
And you forgot about the things that we did
The town where we're living has made you a man
And all of your dreams are washed away in the sand
Well it's alright, it's alright. Who are you and me to say what's wrong and 
what's right. Do you still feel like me? (Do you feel like?). We'll sit down 
here and we shall see. We can talk and find common ground.
And we can just forget about feeling down
We can just forget about life in this town
[Verse 3]
It's funny how your dreams change as you're growing old
You don't wanna be no spaceman, you just want the gold
All the dream stealers are lying in wait
But if you wanna be a spaceman, it's still not to late
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

I was in the biggest army the world had ever seen
We were marching as one on the road to the holy grail
Started out seeking fortune and glory
It's a short song but it's one hell of a story
When you spend your lifetime trying to get your hands
On the holy grail
Well, have you heard about the great crusade
We ran into millions but nobody got paid
We raised four corners of the globe for the holy grail
All the locals scattered, they were hiding in the snow
We were so far from home so how were we to know
There'd be nothing left to plunder when we stumbled on the holy grail
We were full of beans, but we were dying like flies
Those big black birds, they were circling in the sky
And you know what they say, yeah, nobody deserves to die
Oh I
I've been searching for an easy way
To escape the cold light of day
I've been high and I've been low
But I got nowhere else to go
      There's nowhere else to go
I followed orders
God knows where I've been
But I woke up alone
All my wounds were clean
I'm still here
I'm still a fool for the holy grail
Oh yeah, I'm a fool for the holy grail

So I could've been your boyfriend

I just never met a girl I like half as much as you
And we could lay around in bed, stay there all day
Or at least until the afternoon
And I could make you spaghetti with tomato sauce
With just a touch of oregano and a parsley stem
And then when you got sick
I could take the day off work
I could've made you chicken soup
And we could watch soap operas
Oh, those TV dramas
I could catch your cold
And you could take care of me
Mmm, If I could've met you at school, or met you at work
It would have changed everything
Those years of losing, confusion and insecurity
They would have been shared
They would have been easier

   Und ich male Deine Schatten an jede Wand
   Es kommt so anders als man denkt
  Ich gab Dir meine Liebe, gab Dir
Zeit Geduld und Geld
Ich legte mein Leben in Deine kleine Welt
Wer auch immer Dir jetzt den Regen schenkt
Ich hoffe es geht ihm schlecht
Wer auch immer dich durch die Nacht bringt
  Bitte glaub ihm nicht
   Es kommt so anders als man denkt
  Es ist so ohne Dich
Es ist so widerlich, ich will das nicht
Denkst Du vielleicht auch mal an mich
Es ist so ohne Dich
Und wenn Du einsam bist
Denkst Du vielleicht auch mal an mich
  Ich nähte mir ein Bettbezug aus der Zeit die wir hatten
Und trink mir alte Wunden an so tief und allein
Kein Berg, den ich nicht versetzt hab
Zog jede Chance an den Haaren herbei
Für ein Leben lang zu leben, so wild und so frei

Es ist so widerlich, ich will das nicht

Hey, I know it's just a song but it's spice for the recipe
This is a love attack, I know, went out but it's back
It's just like any fad, it retracts before impact
And just like fashion, it's a passion for the with it and hip
If you got the goods, they'll come and buy it just to stay in the clique
  So don't delay, act now, supplies are running out
  Allow if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive
  And if you follow, there may be a tomorrow
  But if the offer's shunned, you might as well be walkin' on the sun
Twenty-five years ago, they spoke out and they broke out
Of recession and oppression and together they toked
And they folked out with guitars around a bonfire
Just singin' and clappin', man, what the hell happened?
Then some were spellbound some were hell-bound, some they fell down
And some got back up and fought back 'gainst the melt down
And their kids were hippie chicks all hypocrites
Because fashion is smashin' the true meaning of it

The bond is broke up so choke up and focus on the close up

Put away the crack before the crack puts you away

Sitä kadonnutta nuoruutta
Ja mieletöntä fiilistä
Kun on ensikertaa kännissä
No ehkä elämässä tarvitsee
Joskus selitellä itselleen
Ja eritellä mielessään
Miksi kuviot on pielessä
Kun sitä tuskin edes
Voi aavistaa unissaan
Kuka saa ja kenelle annetaan
Ja miten raukkamaisesti onnen anti täällä jaetaan
Se vituttaa ei saa
Sut vaikka kantapaikasta kannetaan
Ulos asti rauhoittumaan
Kun hakemalla syitä haetaan
Se luoti tuli oviaukosta
Ohiajavasta autosta
otti kitarasta kimmokkeen
Ja osui portsaria pohkeeseen
Ja vaikka alle varttitunnissa
Oli virkavalta paikalla
Ja koko kylä saatiin saarroksiin
Kun tekijätkin tiedettiin
Ei löydetty kuin
Pelkkä rämisevä peltisanko täynnä luodinreikiä
Ja bussipysäkiltä kylmissään sen tyttöystävä
Kassi kädessään
En tiedä yritinkö ollenkaan
Edes painaa jarrupoljinta
Vai unohdinko jarruttaa
Siinä sohjoisessa kaarteessa

Vastaantulijoiden kaistalla

Sut vaikka kantapaikasta kannetaan
Ulos asti rauhoittumaan

Älä kerro edes vauvasta

49,Sunny Came Home (ver 3),Shawn Colvin,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/shawn-colvin/sunny-came-home-chords-1159121,"SUNNY CAME HOME TO HER FAV’RITE ROOM
A SUNNY SET DOWN IN THE KITCHEN
SHE OPENED A BOOK AND A BOX OF TOOLS
SUNNY CAME HOME WITH A MISSION , SHE SAYS,
“DAYS GO BY I’M HYPNOTIZED
I’M WALKING ON A WIRE
I CLOSE MY EYES AND FLY OUT OF MY MIND,
INTO THE FIRE.
SUNNY CAME HOME WITH A LIST OF NAMES
SHE DIDN’T BELIEVE IN TRANSCENDENCE
“AND IT’S TIME FOR A FEW SMALL REPAIRS,” SHE SAID.
A SUNNY CAME HOME WITH A VENGENCE. SHE SAYS,
“DAYS GO BY I DON’T KNOW WHY
I’M WALKING ON A WIRE
I CLOSE MY EYES AND FLY OUT OF MY MIND,
INTO THE FIRE.
GET THE KIDS AND BRING A SWEATER,
DRY IS GOOD AND WIND IS BETTER.
COUNT THE YEARS, YOU ALWAYS KNEW IT.
STRIKE A MATCH, GO ON AND DO IT. OH DAYS
“DAYS GO BY I’M HYPNOTIZED
I’M WALKING ON A WIRE
I CLOSE MY EYES AND FLY OUT OF MY MIND,
INTO THE FIRE.
OH, LIGHT THE SKY AND HOLD ON TIGHT
THE WORLD IS BURNING DOWN
SHE’S OUT THERE ON HER OWN AND SHE’S ALRIGHT
SUNNY CAME HOME.
SUNNY CAME HOME
I’M HOME
I’M HOME

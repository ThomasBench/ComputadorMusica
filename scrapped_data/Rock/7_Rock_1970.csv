0,Comfortably Numb (ver 2),Pink Floyd,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/pink-floyd/comfortably-numb-chords-1087215,"Hello,
is there anybody in there? 
Just nod if you can hear me;
is there anyone home? 
I hear you're feeling down.
Well, I can ease your pain;
get you on your feet again.
I need some information first.
Just the basic facts:
can you show me where it hurts? 
There is no pain, you are receding.
A distant ships smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you re saying.
When I was a child I had a fever.
My hands felt just like two balloons.
Now I got that feeling once again;
I can't explain, you would not understand.
This is not how I am.
I  have become, comfortably numb.
I  have become, comfortably numb.
Ok, (ok)
just a little pinprick. 
There'll be no more --aaaaaahhhhh!
But you may feel a little sick.
I do believe it's working good.
That'll keep you going for the show.
Come on it's time to go.
There is no pain, you are receding.
A distant ship's smoke on the horizon.
You are only coming through in waves.
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse,
out of the corner of my eye.
I turned to look but it was gone.
I cannot put my finger on it now.
The child is grown, the dream is gone.
I  have become, comfortably numb.

1,Take It To The Limit (ver 2),Eagles,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/eagles/take-it-to-the-limit-chords-136452,"All alone at the end of the evening
and the bright lights have faded to blue.
I was thinking 'bout a woman who might have loved me,
but I never knew.
    You know I've always been a dreamer (spend my life runnin' round)
and it's so hard to change (can't seem to settle down)
but the dreams I've seen lately   keep on turnin' out
and burnin' out and turnin' out the sa - me.
So put me on a highway and show me a sign
and take it to the limit one more   time.
You can spend all your time making money,
Or you can spend all your love making time.
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow
would you still be mine?
    And when you're looking for your freedom (nobody seems to care)
And you can't find the door (can't find it anywhere)
when there's nothing to believe in   still you're coming back,
you're running back, you're coming back for mo - re.
So put me on a highway and show me a sign
and take it to the limit one more time.
     Take it to the limit, take it to the limit,
take it to the limit one more  time.  :|

Hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves
In labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant time
Comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine
And no-one showed us to the land
And no-one knows the wheres or whys
But something stirs and something tries
And starts to climb towards the light
Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can
And no-one calls us to move on
And no-one forces down our eyes
And no-one speaks and no-one tries
And no-one flies around the sun
C#m  vamp     (with some F#m)       x32 
Cloudless everyday you fall upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning
And no-one sings me lullabies
And no-one makes me close my eyes

Drew me loving to your isle.

Sail to me, let me unfold you.""

Were you hare when I was fox?
Now my foolish boat is leaning, 
Broken, lovelorn on your rocks.

Touch me not, come back tomorrow.""
Oh my heart, oh my heart shies from the sorrow.
I'm as puzzled as the oyster,
I'm as troubled as the tide
Should I stand amid the breakers?
Or should I lie with death my bride?
Hear me sing, ""Swim to me, 
Swim to me, let me enfold you.""
Oh my heart, oh my heart is waiting to hold you.

And in the end you'll pack up and fly down south, hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man, all alone and dying of cancer
[Half tempo]
[Guitar solo ad lib]
And when you lose control       you'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows        the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown as you go down all alone
Dragged down by the stone
Gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground how can I find my way out of the maze
Deaf, dumb and blind you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable and noone has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
And everything's done under the sun
Who was born in a house full of pain
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel
Who was fitted with collar and chain
Who was given a pat on back
Who was breaking away from the pack
Who was only a stranger at home
Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone
Who was dragged down by the stone

His horse and his cattle are his only companions.
He works in the saddle and he sleeps in the canyon.
Waiting for summer, his pastures to change.
And as the moon rises he sits by his fire.
Thinkin' about women and glasses of beer.
Closing his eyes as the dogies retire
He sings out a song which is soft but it's clear
As if maybe someone could hear.
Goodnight you moonlight ladies.
Rock-a-bye sweet baby James.
Deep greens and blues are the colors I choose.
Won't you let me go down in my dreams.
And rock-a-bye  sweet baby James.
Now the first of December was covered with snow.
And so was the turnpike from Stockbridge to Boston.
Lord, the Berkshires seemed dreamlike on account of that frosting.
With ten miles behind me and ten thousand more to go.
There's a song that they sing when they take to the highway.
A song that they sing when they take to the sea.
A song that they sing of their home in the sky.
Maybe you can believe it if it helps you to sleep.
But singing works just fine for me.
Goodnight you moonlight ladies.
Rock-a-bye sweet baby James.

Won't you let me go down in my dreams.

 With trunks of memories still to come.
  We found things to do in stormy weather.
  Long may you run.
 Long may you run, long may you run,
 Although these changes have come.
 With your chrome heart shinin'   in the sun
Long may you run.       (break)
                    (break)
Well it was back in Blind River in nineteen sixty-two
 When I last saw you alive.
  But we missed that shift on the long decline.
  Long may you run.
 Long may you run, long may you run,
 Although these changes have come.
 With your chrome heart shinin'   in the sun
Long may you run.       (break)
   Maybe the Beach Boys have got you now
 With those waves singin' Caroline No.
  Rollin' down that empty ocean road,
  Getting to the surf on time.
 Long may you run, long may you run,
 Although these changes have come.
 With your chrome heart shinin'   in the sun
Long may you run.      (break)

And she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh,    and she's buying a stairway to heaven
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings,
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
                 Ooh, it makes me wonder
                 Ooh, it makes me wonder
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west,
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees,
And the voices of those who stand looking
                 Ooh, it makes me wonder
                 Ooh, it really makes me wonder
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now,
It's just a spring clean for the May Queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
                 Ooh, it makes me wonder
                 Ooh, it really makes me wonder
Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know,
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll

Perhaps a bottle of rose instead
Get a table near the street
In our old familiar place
You and I, face to face, um umm
A bottle of red, a bottle of white
It all depends on your appetite
I'll meet you anytime you want
In our Italian Restaurant
Things are okay with me these days
Got a good job, got a good office
Got a new wife, got a new life
And the family's fine
Oh, we lost touch long ago
You lost weight I did not know
You could ever look so nice after so much time
Do you remember those days hanging out at the village green
Engineer boots, leather jackets and tight blue jeans
Woah you drop a dime in the box play the song about New Orleans
Cold beer, hot lights
My sweet romantic teenage nights
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Brenda and Eddie were the popular steadies
And the king and the queen of the prom
Riding around with the car top down and the radio on
Nobody looked any finer
Or was more of a hit at the Parkway Diner
We never knew we could want more than that out of life
Surely Brenda and Eddie would always know how to survive
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Brenda and Eddy were still going steady in the summer of seventy five
When they decided the marriage would be at the end of July
Everyone said they were crazy
Brenda you know that you're much too lazy
Eddie could never afford to live that kind of life
Oh, but there we were waving Brenda and Eddie goodbye
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Well, they got an apartment with deep pile carpet
And a couple of paintings from Sears
A big waterbed that they bought with the bread
They had saved for a couple of years
They started to fight when the money got tight
And they just didn't count on the tears, woh oh, woh oh...yeah rock n roll
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Well, they lived for a while in a very nice style
But it's always the same in the end
They got a divorce as a matter of course
And they parted the closest of friends
Then the king and the queen went back to the green
But you can never go back there again, oh oh, oh oh
Brenda and Eddie had had it already by the summer of seventy five
From the high to the low to the end of the show
For the rest of their lives
They couldn't go back to the greasers
The best they could do was pick up their pieces
We always knew they would both find a way to get by
That's all I heard about Brenda and Eddie
Can't tell you more cause I told you already
And here we are waving Brenda and Eddie goodbye
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh
   Yeah yeah yeah
A bottle of red, oooh a bottle of white
Whatever kind of mood you're in tonight
I'll meet you anytime you want
In our Italian Restaurant

48,Escape The Pina Colada Song (ver 2),Rupert Holmes,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/rupert-holmes/escape-the-pina-colada-song-chords-1664619,"I was tired of my lady,
we'd been together too long
like a worn out recording
of a favorite song. 
So while she lay there sleepin'
I read the paper in bed
and in the personal columns
there was this letter I read. 
If you like piña coladas
and gettin' caught in the rain
if you're not into yoga
if you have half a brain 
if you like makin' love at midnight
in the dunes of a cape
then I'm the love that you've looked for
write to me and escape. 
I didn't think about my lady, 
I know that sounds kind of mean
But me and my old lady 
had fallen into the same old dull routine
So I wrote to the paper, 
took out a personal ad
And though I'm nobody's poet, 
I thought it wasn't half bad.
Yes, I like piña coladas
and getting caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food, 
I am into champagne
I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon
and cut through all this red tape
At a bar called O'Malley's
where we'll plan our escape.
So I waited with high hopes
and she walked in the place
I knew her smile in an instant, 
I knew the curve of her face
It was my own lovely lady 
and she said, ""Aw, it's you.""
Then we laughed for a moment
and I said, ""I never knew.""
That you like piña coladas
and gettin' caught in the rain
And the feel of the ocean
and the taste of champagne
If you like making love at midnight
in the dunes on the cape
You're the lady I've looked for, 
come with me and escape
If you like piña coladas
and gettin' caught in the rain
if you're not into yoga
if you have half a brain 
if you like makin' love at midnight
in the dunes of a cape
then I'm the love that you've looked for
write to me and escape. 
Yes, I like piña coladas
and getting caught in the rain
I'm not much into health food, 
I am into champagne

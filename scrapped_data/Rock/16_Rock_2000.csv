0,Because Of You,Kelly Clarkson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/kelly-clarkson/because-of-you-chords-157639,"  I will not make the same    mistakes that you    did,
 I      will not let myself cause my heart so much misery.
  I will not break the way    you did, you fell so hard,
   I've learned the hard   way to never let it get that far...
   Because of you I never stray     too far from the sidewalk,
Because of you I learned to play on the safe side so I don't  get hurt,
Because of you I find it hard to trust not only me,  but everyone around me,
Because of you,      I am afraid...
   I lose my way, and it's not too long before  you point it out,
I cannot cry, because you know that's weakness in   your eyes;
I'm forced to fake, a smile,      a laugh, everyday   of my life
My heart can't possibly break, when it wasn't even whole to start    with...
Because of you I never stray     too far from the sidewalk,
Because of you I learned to play on the safe side so I don't  get hurt,
Because of you I find it hard to trust not only me,   but everyone around me,
Because of you,       I am afraid...
I watched you die, I heard you cry every night in your  sleep...
I was so young, you should have known better than to lean on me.
  You never thought of anyone else, you just saw your pain,
   and now I cry in the middle of the night, for the same damn thing...
Because of you I never stray    too far from the sidewalk,
   because of you I learned to play on the safe side so I don't   get hurt
Because of you I try my hardest just to forget everything,
because of you I don't know how to let anyone else   in.
Because of you    I'm ashamed of my life because it's empty
  because of you,      I am, afraid...
Because of you....
Because of you......

Not to speak my mind
And to lie to you
Rather than hurt you
Well, I'll confess all of my sins
After several large gins
But still I'll hide from you
Hide what's inside from you
And alarm bells ring
When you say your heart still sings
When you're with me
Oh won't you please forgive me
I no longer hear the music
Oh noooo    noo
And all the memories of the pubs
And the clubs and the drugs and the tubs
We shared together
Will stay with me forever
But all the highs and the lows
And the tos and the fros
They left me dizzy
Oh won't you please forgive me

  With her my heart it disappeared

Under blue lights, all the kites
We flew together

          Do you mind if I sit here down by your graveside,
          And rest for a while in the warm summer sun,
          I've been walking all day and I'm nearly done.
          I see by your gravestone you were only 19,
          When you joined the great fallen in 1916,
          Well I hope you died quick and I hope you died clean,
          Or Willie McBride was it slow and obscene.
          Did they beat the drum slowly,
          Did they play the fife lowly,
          Did they sound the dead march, as they lowered you down,
          Did the band play the last post and chorus,
          Did the pipes play the Flowers of the Forest.
          And did you leave a wife or a sweetheart behind,
          In some loyal heart is your memory enshrined,
          And though you died back in 1916,
          To that loyal heart  you're forever 19.
          Or are you a stranger without even a name,
          Forever enshrined behind some old glass pane,
          In an old photograph all torn tattered and stained,
          And faded to yellow in a brown leather frame.
          Did they beat the drum slowly,
          Did they play the fife lowly,
          Did they sound the dead march, as they lowered you down,
          Did the band play the last post and chorus,
          Did the pipes play the Flowers of the Forest.
          The sun's shining down on these green fields of France,
          The warm wind blows gently and the red poppies dance,
          The trenches have vanished long under the plow
          No gas, no barbed wire, no guns firing now.
          But here in this graveyard it's still ""No Man's Land"",
          The countless white crosses in mute witness stand,
          To man's blind indifference to his fellow man,
          And a whole generation that were butchered and damned.
          Did they beat the drum slowly,
          Did they play the fife lowly,
          Did they sound the dead march, as they lowered you down,
          Did the band play the last post and chorus,
          Did the pipes play the Flowers of the Forest.
          And I can't help but wonder, oh Willie McBride
          Do all those who lie here know why they died,
          Did you really believe them when they told you the cause
          Did they really believe that this war would end wars.
          Well, the suffering, the sorrow, the glory, the shame
          The killing and dying it was all done in vain,
          Oh Willie McBride it all happened again,
          And again, and again, and again, and again.
          Did they beat the drum slowly,
          Did they play the fife lowly,
          Did they sound the dead march, as they lowered you down,
          Did the band play the last post and chorus,
          Did the pipes play the Flowers of the Forest.

There’s secrets in this life that I can’t hide

Maybe I’m just blind
Hold me when I’m here
Hold me when I’m scared
And love me when I’m gone

Possibly the one you wanted me to be

Give up everything

Can not see under my skin

Standing in the shelter out of the rain
She tucked a note into his hand
Later on they took his car
Drove on down where the beaches are
He wrote her name in the sand
Never even let go of her hand
Somehow they stayed that way
For those 5 days in May
Made all the stars around them shine
Funny how you can look in vain
Living on nerves and such sweet pain
The loneliness that cuts so fine
To find the face you've seen a thousand times
Sometimes the world begins
To set you up on your feet again
It wipes the tears from your eyes
How will you ever know
The way that circumstances go
Always gonna hit you by surprise
I know my past
You were there
In everything I've done
You are the one
Looking back it's hard to tell
Why they stood while others fell
Spend your life working it out
All I know is one cloudy day
They both just ran away
Rain on the windshield heading south
Oh she loved the lines around his mouth
Sometimes the world begins
To set you up on your feet again
I know it wipes the tears from your eyes
How will you ever know
The way that circumstances go
Always gonna hit you by surprise

Leave the peace alone
How we all are slowly changing
Dims a fading light
In our Souls

the things we hold
are always first to go
and who’s to say
we won’t end up alone
On broken wings I’m falling
and it won’t be long
The skin on me is burning
By the fires of the sun
On skinned knees I’m bleeding
and it won’t be long
I’ve got to find that meaning
I’ll search for so long
Cry ourselves to sleep
We will sleep alone forever
Will you lay me down
In the same place with all I love
Mend the broken homes
Care for them
Save the fading light in our souls
In my opinion seeing is to know
What you give
will always carry you
And who’s to say

  There's something
  The street looks when
it's just rained
off the pavement
Walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask
you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
  We're driving down the road
  I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not
  But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent mindedly making me want you
  And I don't know how it
gets better than this
drag me head first
Fearless And I don't know
why but with you I'd
dance In a storm in my
best dress Fearless
  So baby drive slow
  Until we run out of road
in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here
in this passenger’s seat
You put your eyes on me
capture every memory
  Well you stood there
with me in the doorway
my hands shake
I'm not usually this way but
  You pull me in and I’m
a little more brave
It’s the first kiss it's flawless
really something it’s fearless
 You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
 Its the morning of your very first day
 You say hi to your friends you aint seen in a while
 Try and stay out of everybodys way
 It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
 For the next four years in this town
 Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
 You know I haven't seen you around, before
 'Cause when you're fifteen and
 Somebody tells you they love you
 You're gonna believe them
 And when you're fifteen
 Feeling like there's nothing to figure out
 Well count to ten, take it in
 This is life before you know who you're gonna be
 At fifteen
 You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
 And soon enough you're best friends
 Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
 We'll be out of here as soon as we can
 And then you're on your very first date
 And he's got a car and you're feeling like flying
 And you're momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
 And you're dancing round your room when the night ends
 When the night ends
 'Cause when you're fifteen and
 Somebody tells you they love you
 You're gonna believe them
 And when you're fifteen
 And your first kiss makes your head spin 'round
 But in your life you'll do things greater than
 Dating the boy on the football team
 But I didnt know it at fifteen
 When all you wanted was to be wanted
 Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
 Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
 But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
 And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
 Who changed his mind and we both cried
 'Cause when you're fifteen and
 Somebody tells you they love you
 You're gonna believe them
 And when you're fifteen
 Don't forget to look before you fall
 I've found time can heal most anything
 And you just might find who you're supposed to be
 I didn't know who I was supposed to be
 At fifteen

 Your very first day, take a deep breath girl
 Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
We were both young when i first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
Im standing there, on a balcony of summer air
See the lights, See the party the ball gowns
I see you, make, your way through the crowd
You say hello, Little did i know
That you were romeo you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
And i was crying on the staircase
Begging you please don't go, and i said
Romeo take me, somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all theres left to do is run
You'll be the prince and i'll be the princess
Its a love story, baby just say yes
So i sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet because we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Let’s keep this down for a little while
Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said stay away from Juliet
Which you were everything to me I was
Begging you please don't go, and i said
Romeo save me, don't try to tell me how i feel
  This love is difficult, but its re-al,
don't be afraid we'll, make it out of business
Its a love story baby just say yes, oh
I got tired of waiting, wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
Then i met you on the outskirts of town and i said
Romeo save me, i've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting, for you but you never come
Is this, in my head, i don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out, a ring and said
Marry me Juliet you'll never have to be alone
I love you and thats, all I really know
I talked to your dad go pick out a white dress
Its a love story baby just say yes
Oh, oh, yes
We were very young when i first saw, you

rocks at your window
  I'll be the one waiting
there even when it's cold

might have me believing

you look like an angel
  Can't help it if I wanna
kiss you in the rain so

been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no
one else Mm I can't help myself

holding back this feeling
So I've got some
things to say to you

talk way you say my name
  It's beautiful wonderful

people always leaving
I think you and I
should stay the same

lights you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
   I'm waiting alone now
so come on and come out
And pull me near and
shine shine shine
  Hey Stephen I could
give you fifty reasons
Why   I should be the one you
choose          All those
other girls   well
they're beautiful
But would they write a
song for you? Haha

Comes out just

Cause I honestly
believed in you
Holding on
The days drag on
Stupid girl
I should have known
I'm not a princess

I'm not the one you'll
Lead her up the stairwell

you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you
And your white horse
  Maybe I was naive
  Got lost in your eyes
And never really had a
chance    My mistake I
didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to
have the upper hand
I had so many dreams
About you and me
Happy endings now I know
  And there you are
on your knees
  Begging for forgiveness
  begging for me
  Just like I always wanted
  but I'm so sorry
I'm not your princess
this ain't a fairytale
I'm gonna find someone
someday who's actually
This ain't a big world

Letting my rear view

That what you're looking for
If you could see that I'm
Been here all along
so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting
All this time how could
you not know baby
You belong with me
driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me
Can't you see that I'm
Been here all along
so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting
All this time how
could you not know baby
You belong with me
you belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me you belong with me

I see your face in my
mind as I drive away
Cause none of us thought
it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes
we change our minds
But it's killing me to see
you go after all this time
  Mmm mmm mmm
Music starts playing like
the end of a sad movie
It's the kinda ending
you don't really wanna see
Cause it's tragedy and it'll
only bring you down
Now I don't know what
to be without you around
  And we know it's never
simple, never easy
  Never a clean break
No one here to save me
You're the only thing I
know like the back of my hand
I can’t breathe
  without you
  But I have to
  Breathe
  without you
  But I have to
Never wanted this never
wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in
the road I tried to swerve
But people are people and
sometimes it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna
save us from the fall out
I can’t breathe
  without you
  But I have to
  Breathe
  without you
  But I have to
It's two a.m.
just lost a friend
not easy, easy for me
It's two a.m.
just lost a friend
ain't easy, easy for me
  And we know it's
never simple, never easy
  Never a clean break
No one here to save me oh
I can’t breathe
  without you
  But I have to
I can’t breathe
  without you
  But I have to
  Breathe
  without you
  I'm sorry, I'm sorry
  I'm sorry, I'm sorry
  I'm sorry, I'm sorry
  I'm sorry
 I took a chance, I took a shot
 And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
 You took a swing, I took it hard
 And down here from the ground I see who you are
 I'm sick and tired of your attitude
 I'm feeling like I don't know you
 You tell me that you love me then cut me down
 And I need you like a heartbeat
 But you know you got a mean streak
 Makes me run for cover when you're around
 And here's to you and your temper
 Yes, I remember what you said last night
 And I know that you see what you're doing to me
 Tell me why
 You could write a book on
 How to ruin someones perfect day
 Well I get so confused and frustrated
 Forget what I'm trying to say, oh
 I'm sick and tired of your reasons
 I got no one to believe in
 You tell me that you want me, then push me around
 And I need you like a heartbeat
 But you know you got a mean streak
 Makes me run for cover when you're around
 And here's to you and your temper
 Yes, I remember what you said last night
 And I know that you see what you're doing to me
 Tell me why
Why... do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside
Why... do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind
 I'm sick and tired of your attitude
 I'm feeling like I don't know you
 You tell me that you want me then cut down
 I'm sick and tired of your reasons
 I got no one to believe in
 You ask me for my love then you push me around
 Here's to you and your temper
 Yes, I remember what you said last night
 And I know that you see what you're doing to me
 Tell me why, why, tell me why,  ohh
 I take a step back, let you go
 I told you I'm not bulletproof, now you know
F# -    244322
All this time I was wasting
Hoping you would come around
I've been giving out
chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taking me this long
Baby but I figured you out
And you're thinking
But not this time around
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can say
But I don't
Like I did before
You're not sorry
no no ohhh
Looking so innocent
I might believe you
if I didn't know
Could've loved
If you hadn't left me
waiting in the cold
And you got your
And I'm tired of
being last to know
asking me to listen
Cause it's worked
each time before
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can say
But I don't
Like I did before
You're not sorry
no no ohhh
You're not sorry
no no ohhh
You had me falling
And it never would've
gone away no
You used to shine
But I watched
all of it fade so
End on Ebm(hold)

He is sensible and
so incredible
And all my single
friends are jealous
He says everything I need
I couldn't ask for
anyhting better
He opens up my door and
I get into his car
And he says ""You look beautiful
tonight"" And I feel perfectly fine
But I miss screaming and fighting
And it's 3 a.m. and
Your so in love that you act insane
and that's the way I loved you
  Breaking down and coming undone
it's a roller coaster kinda rush
And I never knew I could feel that
much and that's the way I loved you
He respects my space
and never makes me wait
And he calls exactly
when he says he will
He's close to my mother
talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
and I'm comfortable
He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
intoxicating complicating
Got away by some mistake and now
ohh ohh ohh
and that's the way I loved you
ohh ohh ohh
and that's the way I loved you

Once upon a time I believe
it was a Tuesday
When I caught your eye
we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
you looked me in the eye
And told me you loved me
Cause it seems to me his
thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened
second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone
he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when
he said forever and always
Oh and it rains in your
bedroom everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
and it rains when you're gone
Cause I was there when
you said forever and always
Was I out of line? Did I
say something way too honest?
Made you run and hide
like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes thought
I knew you for a minute
Now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything
coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that
cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a
minute but I don't anymore
Did you mean it baby?
I don't think so
Oh
back up baby back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up baby back up
Did you forget everything?
And I stare at the phone
he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when
he said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby
You said forever and always

  I’m five years old
  It’s getting cold
  I’ve got my big coat on
  I hear your laugh
  And look up smiling at you
I run and run
  Past the pumpkin patch
  And the tractor rides up now
The sky is gold
  I hug your legs and fall asleep
On the way home
  I don’t know why all the
trees change in the fall
  I know you’re not scared
of anything at all
  Don’t know if Snow White’s
house is near or far away
But I know I had the best
day with you today
  I’m thirteen now
  And don’t know how my
friends Could be so mean
  I come home crying
And you hold me tight
And grab the keys
  And we drive and drive
  Until we’ve found a
town Far enough away
  And we talk and
window-shop
Until I’ve forgotten
all their names
  I don’t know who
am I gonna talk to
now at school
  I'm not laughing
in a car I'm home with you
  Don't know how I'm
gonna say to feel okay
But I know I had the best
day with you today
  I have an excellent father
  His strength is making me stronger
  God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out he’s better than I am
  I grew up in a pretty house
And I had space to run
And I had the best days with you
  There is a video
I found from back when I was three
  You set up a paint set in the kitchen
And you’re talking to me
  It’s the edge of princesses
and pirate ships
And the seven dwarves
  Daddy’s smart and you're
the prettiest lady
In the whole wide world
  Now I know why all the
trees change in the fall
  I know you were on my
side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
  Staying back and watching me shine
And I didn’t know if you knew
So I’m taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today
Gm -  355333
  It's just a sad picture
  The final blow hits you
  Somebody else gets
what you wanted again
  You know it's all the same
  Another time and place
  Repeating history and
you're getting sick of it
But I believe in
whatever you do
And I'll do anything
to see it through
change Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up
to hold us back will fall down
It's a revolution the time will
come for us to finally win
  We'll sing hallelujah
We'll sing hallelujah oh
  So we've been outnumbered
  Raided and now cornered
  It's hard to fight when
the fight ain't fair
  We're getting stronger now
  From things they never found
  They might be bigger but we're
faster and never scared
  You can walk away and
say we don't need this
But there's something in your
eyes says we can beat this
change Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up
to hold us back will fall down
It's a revolution the time will
come for us to finally win
  We'll sing hallelujah
We'll sing hallelujah oh
  Tonight we're standing
on our knees
worked for all these years
The battle was long it's
the fight of our lives
champions tonight?
changed Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up
to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution throw your
hands up cause we never gave
in   We'll sing hallelujah
We'll sing hallelujah
Hallelujah

20,Time Runs Out,John Frusciante,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-frusciante/time-runs-out-chords-194574,"I didn't lose you
And those fights I fought
I don't owe anyone
And sleeping all night
These times I recall
They come up they come clean
I've been asleep 
On top of myself
I was born in the morning
I died at night, people 
I was found in a mirror, baby
They couldn't get me out
In these times, times runs
It runs out
Baby, dreams are a long time
Hey, feelings are gone us 
I've been sleeping it once more
Leave us the water
Hey, simple of what there's not
Catch my meaning, once more 
I'm sealing down the woho
Cat stand inside world wins
Leave us softly, where you must be
The truth place is lies
The mistakes need to annoy
Someone must be sleeping because all is quiet
Is there nothing in the mirror, when shook the light

She calls up her friends, they already know & they've all got tickets to see his show
She tags along, and stands in the crowd looks up at the man that she turn down

spending every dollar at the liquor shop
and even though I know I haven't got a lot
I try to give you loving till the day you drop
I've been training like a Pavlov dog
sent my independence out to take a hike
all you gotta do is activate my bell
and I'll fetch you anything you like
Going once, going twice
Every man here has a price
Over here, over there
Sold to not a single lady in here
I've been here like a thousand times
Dated every woman in the atmosphere
I've been to every continent
Broken all the hearts in every hemisphere
And if I'm not the type of guy you like to circumvent
Just remember not to love me when I disappear
I graduated at the top
I like to take advantage of the bourgeoisie
So if you have a fantasy of being a queen
Maybe you should blow a couple bucks on me
Going once, going twice
Won't these gentlemen suffice?
Any here, any there
Any motions anywhere
Going twice, going thrice
Guess this means we'll go 4 times a lady
I promise I'll be all you need, ever need
You'll never have to shop around
I'll give you all you ever need, ever need
Don't worry, I will never let you down, let you down
Don't worry, I will never let you down
So many ladies are wanting for mates
And the prospects are good but the date's never great
Over here, over there, over where, anywhere
They're too busy with winning
The bidding to care and he's
Sold

What God has willed, what God has planned
I only know at His right hand
Stands One who is my Savior
I take Him at His word and deed
Christ died to save me this I read
And in my heart I find a need
Of Him to be my Savior
That He would leave His place on high
And come for sinful man to die
You count it strange so once did I
Before I knew my Savior
My Savior loves, my Savior lives
My Savior's always there for me
My God He was, my God He is, 
My God He's always gonna be (x2)
Yes, living, dying let me bring
My strength, my solace from this spring
That He who lives to be my King
Once died to be my Savior
That He would leave His place on High
And come for sinful man to die

Before I knew my Savior
My Savior loves, My Savior lives
My Savior's always there for me

I get to be myself and I get to sing
I get to play being irresponsible
I come home late and I love your soul
I never forget you in my prayers
I never have a bad day to report
You're my picture on the wall
You're my vision in the hall
You're the one I'm talking to
When I get in from my work
You are my girl and you don't even know it
I am living out the life of a poet
I am the jester in the ancient court
And you're the funny little frog in my throat
My eyesight's fading, my hearing's dim
I can't get insured for the state I'm in
I'm a danger to myself, I've been starting fights
At the party at the club on a Saturday night
But I don't get disapproving from my girl
She gets all the highlights wrapped in pearls
You're my picture on the wall
You're my vision in the hall
You're the one I'm talking to
When I get in from my work
You are my girl and you don't even know it
I am living out the life of a poet
I am the jester in the ancient court
And you're the funny little frog in my throat
I had a conversation with you last night
It's a little one-sided but that's alright
I tell you in the kitchen about my day
You sit on the bed in the dark changing places
With the ghost that was there before you came
You've come to save my life again
I don't dare to touch your hand
I don't dare to think of you
In a physical way
And I don't know how you smell
You are the cover of my magazine
You're my fashion tip, a living museum
I'd pay to visit you on rainy Sundays
I'll maybe tell you all about it someday

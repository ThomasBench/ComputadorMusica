Yesterday don't matter if it's gone 
While the sun is bright 
Or in the darkest night 
No one knows 
She comes and goes 
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday 
Who could hang a name on you? 
When you change with every new day 
Still I'm gonna miss you
Don't question why she needs to be so free 
She'll tell you it's the only way to be 
She just can't be chained 
To a life where nothing's gained 
And nothing's lost 
At such a cost 
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday 
Who could hang a name on you? 
When you change with every new day 
Still I'm gonna miss you
There's no time to lose, I heard her say 
Catch your dreams before they slip away 
Dying all the time 
Lose your dreams 
And you may lose your mind. 
Ain't life unkind? 
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday 
Who could hang a name on you? 
When you change with every new day 
Still I'm gonna miss you
Goodbye, Ruby Tuesday 
Who could hang a name on you? 
When you change with every new day 
Still I'm gonna miss you

Well, I guess I m doing fine

There was nobody, not a soul around

A flag stuck on my window screen

Gazing from my window to the streets below
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow.
I am a rock, I am an is-land.
  I've built walls, a fortress steep and mighty,
That none may penetrate.
I have no need of friendship; friendship causes pain.
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain.
I am a rock, I am an is-land.
Don't talk of love, but I've heard the word before;
It's slee-eeping in my memory.
I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died.
If I never loved I never would have cried.
I am a rock, I am an is-land.
I have my books and my poetry to protect me;
I am shielded in my armor,
Hiding in my room, safe within my womb.
I touch no one and no one touches me.
I am a rock, I am an is-land.
And a rock feels no pain;
And an island never cries.

And in the dark deserted station, restless in anticipation,
A man waits in the shadows.
His restless eyes leap and scratch, at all that they can touch or catch,
And hidden deep within his pocket, safe within his silent socket,
He holds a coloured crayon.
Now from the tunnel's stony womb, the carriage rides to meet the groom,
And opens wide and welcome doors, but he hesitates, then withdraws
Deeper in the shadows.
And the train is gone suddenly, on wheels clicking silently
Like a gently tapping litany, and he holds his crayon rosary
Tighter in his hand.
Now from his pocket quick he flashes, the crayon on the wall he slashes,
Deep upon the advertising, a single-worded poem comprised of
Four letters.
And his heart is laughing, screaming, pounding, 
The poem across the tracks rebounding,
Shadowed by the exit light, his legs take their ascending flight
To seek the breast of darkness and be suckled by the night.

I will make you
Queen of everything you see
I'll put you on the map
I'll cure you of disease
Let's say we up and left this town
And turned our future upside-down
We'll make pretend that you and me
Lived ever after, happily
She asked me, ""Son, when I grow old,
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone,
Will you take care of me?""
I will make you
Queen of everything you see
I'll put you on the map
I'll cure you of disease
And since we know that dreams are dead
And life turns plans up on their head
I will plan to be a bum
So I just might become someone
She asked me, ""Son, when I grow old,
Will you buy me a house of gold?
And when your father turns to stone,
Will you take care of me?""
I will make you
Queen of everything you see
I'll put you on the map
I'll cure you of disease

He was growing in my garden and
I pulled him out by his hair, like a weed
And like weeds do he only came and grew back again
So I figured this time I might as well let him be
Lemon Boy and me started to get along together
I helped him plant his seeds and we'd mow the lawn in bad weather
It's actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him
So I got myself a citrus friend
But soon his bitter-sweet started to rub off on me
You'd think smelling like lemon zest would be pretty neat
I found out that my friends were more of the savory type
And they weren't too keen with compromising with a nice lemon pie
So Lemon Boy and me, we just got to get along together
I helped him plant his seeds and we'd mow the lawn in bad weather
It's actually pretty easy being nice to a bitter boy like him
So I got myself a citrus friend
But what if I run out of fertilizer?
What if the clouds run out of rain?
What if Lemon Boy won't grow no longer?
What if beaches dry of sugar cane? Oh well,
The whales start to beach themselves
Tortoise shells tear away from their spines
It happens all the time
It happens all the time
Lemon Boy and I, we're gonna live forever
Like Snufkin and Little My, we'll get around wherever
Lemon Boy and I, we're gonna live forever

Knows everybody's disapproval, I should've worshipped her sooner
If the Heavens ever did speak, she’s the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak, a fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it
 My church offers no absolutes, she tells me 'worship in the bedroom'
The only heaven I'll be sent to is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it. Command me to be well
A-A-A-A-A-  Amen Amen Amen
         Take me to church I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death, good God, let me give you my life
 If I'm a pagan of the good times, my lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side she demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea, get something shiny
 Something meaty for the main course, that's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable? We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty, that looks plenty, this is hungry work
 Take me to church I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death, good God, let me give you my life
 No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human, only then I am clean     Oh
Oh   Amen  Amen  Amen
 Take me to church I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

Come on dear I think times a wastin'
Before we have to go back inside
And return to our normal lives

Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence
Fools said I, you do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out it's warning
And the words that it was forming
The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sound of silence

He was waitin' for the bus in his army green
Sat down in a booth, in a cafe there
He gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair
He's a little shy so she give him a smile
And he said would you mind sittin' down for a while
And talkin' to me, I'm feelin' a little low
She said I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go
So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said I bet you got a boyfriend but I don't care
I got no one, to send a letter to
Would you mind if I sent one back here to you
 I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end
Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
Never more to be alone
When the letter said, a soldier's comin' home
So the letters came from an army camp
In California then Afghanistan
And he told her of his heart, it might be love
And all of the things that he was so scared of
He said when it's gettin' kinda rough over here
I think of that day sittin' down at the pier
And I close my eyes and see your pretty smile
Don't worry but I won't be able to write for a while
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
Too young, for him they told her
Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier

Waitin' for the soldier to come back again

The Lord's Prayer said and the anthem sang
A man said ""Folks, would you bow your head
To a list of local soldiers dead""
Cryin' all alone under the stands
Was a piccolo player in the marchin' band
And one name read, and nobody really cared
But the pretty little girl, with a bow in her hair
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy

Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
Our love will never end

I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale

Oh may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless, stand before the throne

Weak made strong in the Savior's love
Through the storm
He is Lord

I mistakenly called them by your name
I was let down, it wasn't the same
I'm doing fine, trying to derail my one track mind
Regaining my self-worth in record time
But I can't help but think of your other in the bed that was mine
Am I a masochist, resisting urges to punch you in the teeth
Call you a bitch and leave?
Why did I come here? To sit and watch you stare at your feet?
What was the plan? Absolve your guilt and shake hands?
I feel no need to forgive but I might as well
But let me kiss your lips so I know how it felt
Pay for my coffee and leave before the sun goes down
Walk for hours in the dark feeling all hell
Don't hold your breath, forget you ever saw me at my best
You don't deserve what you don't respect
Don't deserve what you say you love and then neglect
Now bite your tongue, it's too dangerous to fall so young
Take back what you said
Can't lose what you never had
I feel no need to forgive but I might as well
But let me kiss your lips so I know how it felt
Pay for my coffee and leave before the sun goes down
Walk for hours in the dark feeling all hell

 I was running from my brother and his friends
 And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as I rolled down
 I was younger then,
Take me back to when...
 I found my heart and broke it here
 Made friends and lost them through the years
 And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long,
 I know I've grown
 And I can't wait to go home
 I'm on my way
 Driving at 90 down those country lanes
 Singing to 'Tiny Dancer'
 And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
 We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
 Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
 Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
 Had my first kiss on a Friday night,
 I don't reckon that I did it right
 But I was younger then,
 Take me back to when...
 We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
 We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
 Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
 But I can't wait to go home
 I'm on my way,
 Driving at 90 down those country lanes 
 Singing to 'Tiny Dancer'
 And I miss the way you make me feel,and it's real
 We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
             Over the castle on the hill
             Over the castle on the hill
 One friend left to sell clothes,
 One works down by the coast,
 One had two kids but lives alone,
 One's brother overdosed,
 One's already on his second wife
 One's just barely getting by
 But these people raised me
 And I can't wait to go home
 I'm on my way,
 I still remember these old country lanes,
 When we did not know the answers,
 And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real,
 We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill.

Carefully
I was going to live
You wouldn't leave till we loved in the morning
You'd learned from movies how love ought to be
And you'd say you love me and look in my eyes
But I know through mine you were
Looking in yours
And did you know the liberty bell is a replica
Silently housed in its original walls
And while its dreams played music in the night
Quietly
It was told to believe
I always wanted to die clean and pretty
But I'd be too busy on working days
So I am relieved that the turbulence wasn't forecasted
I couldn't have changed anyways

44,Keep The Wolves Away,Uncle Lucius,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/uncle-lucius/keep-the-wolves-away-chords-1248071,"Took my first breath where the muddy Brazos
spills into the gulf of Mexico
where the skyline is covered by chemical plants
that put bread on the table of a workin man
well the workin man does his best to provide
safety and shelter for kids and a wife
given a little of his soul everyday
makin overtime to keep the wolves away
Well I was barely thirteen when the company man
Tried to dig my daddy's grave
It happened on a French owned tanker ship
Spillin' poison into Galveston Bay
Where the liquid fire filled his lungs and his eyes
Silenced, any moans or cries
Cold and the Grit, the damn stinkin pain
but he fought like hell to keep the wolves away
For the next few years dad was sick as a dog
but he made a recovery just to spite the odds.
The settlement came and we moved out of town
where the sky isn't heavy with refinery clouds.
Yeah he's still alive he's doing good he's in his fifties
but the money's runnin out and he's pinchin for pennies
so I'm going for broke with every song I play,
cause now it's my turn to keep the wolves away

You know you make my world light up
When I was down
When I was hurt
You came to lift me up...
Life is a drink, and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river,  dried up
You came to rain a flood
So drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Pour on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Pour on a symphony
When I'm lower, lower, lower, low
I-Oh-ah-oh-ah
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
I-oh-ah-oh-ah
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
Ohhhhh, angels sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the stars come out
Put your wings on me, on me
When I was so heavy
Pour on a symphony
When I'm lower, lower, lower, low
I-Oh-ah-oh-ah
I'm feeling drunk and high
So high, so high
I-oh-ah-oh-ah
I'm feeling drunk and high

You grew up doing what your daddy done
And you don't ask questions, you do it just because
You don't climb too high or dream too much
With a whole lotta work and a little bit of luck you can
Wind up right back where your daddy was
This little bitty town It aint nothin new
We all stick around 'cause they all tell us to
Swallow your pride just to make your family proud
If I didn't think that it would shut the whole place down
I'd ride my pony right out of this one horse town
Yeah, this one horse town
I'm an old married man at the age of 23
Got two little boys on the baseball team
And that might be their only ticket out
All they got is a worn out name
and a daddy that could have gone all the way
but I hung my saddle up and I settled down
This little bitty town It aint nothin new
We all stick around 'cause they all tell us to
Swallow your pride just to make your family proud
If I didn't think that it would shut the whole place down
I'd ride my pony right out of this one horse town
Yeah, this one horse town
This little bitty town Oh yeah, it aint nothin new
We all stick around 'cause they all tell us to
Swallow your pride just to make your family proud
If I didn't think that it would shut the whole thing down
I'd saddle that one horse and ride it right out of this town

As mercy and grace unfold

I hunger and thirst
With arms stretched wide
I know You hear my cry
Speak to me now
Speak to me now
I surrender
I surrender
I want to know You more

Jesus breathe within

Stir within my soul

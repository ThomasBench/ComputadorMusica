To feel like Ive had long enough with you
Forget the world now we wont let them see
        But theres one thing left to do
Now that the weight has lifted
And love has surely shifted my way
Marry me             today and every day
     Marry me, if I ever get the nerve to say hello in this cafe
Say you will (hmm)  say you will (hmm)   
Together could never be close enough for me
To feel like I am close enough to you
You wear white and Ill wear out the words I Love
You and You're Beautiful
Now that the wait is over
And love has finally shown her my way   
Marry me             today and every day
     Marry me, if I ever get the nerve to say hello in this cafe
Say you will (hmm)  say you will (hmm)   
Promise me youll always be happy by my side
I promise to sing to you when all the music dies
Marry me             today and every day
     Marry me, if I ever get the nerve to say hello in this cafe
Say you will (hmm)  say you will (hmm)  say you will (hmm)

Forget, I’m not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But I’m still waiting
I’m through with doubt
There’s nothing left for me to figure out
I’ve paid a price
And I’ll keep paying
I’m not ready to make nice
I’m not ready to back down
I’m still mad as hell and
I don’t have time to go round and round and round
It’s too late to make it right
I probably wouldn’t if I could
‘Cause I’m mad as hell
Can’t bring myself to do what it is you think I should
I know you said
Can’t you just get over it
It turned my whole world around
And I kind of like it
I made my bed and I sleep like a baby
With no regrets and I don’t mind sayin’
It’s a sad sad story when a mother will teach her
Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger
And how in the world can the words that I said
Send somebody so over the edge
That they’d write me a letter
Sayin’ that I better shut up and sing
Or my life will be over
I’m not ready to make nice
I’m not ready to back down

The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled King composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Maybe I’ve been here before
I know this room, I’ve walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I’ve seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
There was a time when you let me know
What’s really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The Holy Dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Maybe there’s a God above
And all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it’s not a cry you can hear at night
It’s not somebody who’s seen the light

I trust you all the same
I don't know why

My bruises shine
Our broken fairytale
So hard to hide
I still believe
It's you and me to the end of time
When we collide we come together
If we don't we'll always be apart
I'll take a bruise, I know you're worth it
When you hit me, hit me hard
Sitting in a wishing hole
Hoping it stays right
Feet cast in solid stone
I've got Gilligan's eyes

When I die lord oh won’t you put my soul up on a train
Won’t you send it Southbound give it a cool bluesman name
I’ve been lost on those back roads so many times I've gone blind
Losing faith in my family had driven me outta my damn mind
But on the South side of heaven won’t you take me home
Cause I've been broke down for so long and Lord it's gettin’ cold
Well I've been a desperado in west Texas for so long lord, I need a change
And for ten long years, this old place ain’t seen a drop of rain
And that wind blows everyday Lord, oh like a desert snow
Like a lost bound train, running on cocaine and out of control
But on the South side of heaven won’t you take me home
Cause I've been broke down for so long and Lord it's gettin’ cold
(end midway on Em while starting the next verse)
Along those Louisiana byways… lonesome highways roll on 
Won’t you take me where the poor man lives… it’s where I call my home
And can't you see that a breeze… is nothin’ but a change in pace
Money can’t buy my soul… ‘cause it comes from a hard earned place
But on the South side of heaven won’t you take me home

J'te raconterai les souvenirs
Bien gravés dans ma mémoire
De cette époque où vieillir
Était encore bien illusoire
Quand j'agaçais les p'tites filles
Pas loin des balançoires
Et que mon sac de billes
Devenait un vrai trésor
Et ces hivers enneigés
À construire des igloos
Et rentrer les pieds g'lés
Juste à temps pour Passe-Partout
Mais au bout du ch'min dis-moi c'qui va rester
De la p'tite école et d'la cour de récré?
Quand les avions en papier ne partent plus au vent
On se dit que l'bon temps passe finalement...
... comme une étoile filante
Si je m'arrête un instant
Pour te parler de la vie
Je constate que bien souvent
On choisit pas mais on subit,
Et que les rêves des ti-culs
S'évanouissent ou se refoulent
Dans cette réalité crue
Qui nous embarque dans le moule
La trentaine, la bedaine
Les morveux, l'hypothèque
Les bonheurs et les peines
Les bons coups et les échecs
Travailler, faire d'son mieux
En arracher, s'en sortir
Et espérer être heureux
Un peu avant de mourir
Mais au bout du ch'min dis-moi c'qui va rester
De notre p'tit passage dans ce monde effréné?
Après avoir existé pour gagner du temps
On s'dira que l'on était finalement
... que des étoiles filantes
Si je m'arrête un instant
Pour te parler de la vie
Juste comme ça tranquillement
Pas loin du carré St-Louis
C'est qu'avec toi je suis bien
Et que j'ai pu l'goût de m'en faire
Parce que tsé voir trop loin
C'pas mieux que r'garder en arrière
Malgré les vielles amertumes
Et les amours qui passent
Les chums qu'on perds dans' brume
Et les idéaux qui se cassent
La vie s'accroche et renaît
Comme les printemps reviennent
Dans une bouffée d'air frais
Qui apaisent les coeurs en peine
Ça fait que si à soir t'as envie de rester
Avec moi, la nuit est douce on peut marcher
Et même si on sait ben que tout dure rien qu'un temps
J'aimerais ça que tu sois pour un moment....
... mon étoile filante
Mais au bout du ch'min dis-moi c'qui va rester...

What seems to be the problem
All the ones you tell your troubles to
They don't really care for you
Come and tell me what you're thinking
Cause just when the boat is sinking
A little light is blinking
And I will come and rescue you
Lots of girls walk around in tears
But that's not for you
You've been looking all around for years
For someone to tell your troubles to
Come and sit with me and talk a while
Let me see your pretty little smile
Put your troubles in a little pile
And I will sort them out for you
Lots of girls walk around in tears
But that's not for you
You've been looking all around for years
For someone to tell your troubles to
Come and sit with me and talk a while
Let me see your pretty little smile
Put your troubles in a little pile
And I will sort them out for you
I'll fall in love with you
I think I'll marry you

sintamis mong magmahal
para kang pintura
buhay koy ikaw ang nagpinta
para kang unan
pinapainit mo ang aking tiyan
para kang kumot
na yumayakap sa tuwing
ako'y nalulungkot
Kaya't wag magtataka
kung bakit ayaw kitang mawala
Kung hindi man tayo hanggang dulo
wag mong kalimutan
nandito lang ako
laging umaalalay
di ako lalayo
dahil ang tanging panalangin

Hear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an Armageddon flame (Hey!)
The shame, the ones who died without a name
Hear the dogs howling out of key
To a hymn called ""Faith and Misery"" (Hey!)
And bleed, the company lost the war today
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday
Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protester has crossed the line (Hey!)
To find, the money's on the other side
Can I get another Amen? (Amen!)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday
Just cause (hey, hey, hey), just cause, because we're outlaws yeah!
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
This is our lives on holiday

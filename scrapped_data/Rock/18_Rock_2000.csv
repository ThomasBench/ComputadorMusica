Rain clouds come to play again
Has no one told you she's not breathing?
Hello, I'm your mind giving you
Someone to talk to
Hello...
If I smile and don't believe
Soon I know I'll wake from this dream
Don't try to fix me, I'm not broken
Hello, I'm the lie living for you
So you can hide
Don't cry
Suddenly I know I'm not sleeping
Hello, I'm still here
All that's left of yesterday

The stars push their dark wills down on you.
And wolves all tear themselves apart better in packs.
That's just a function that we'll have to work on through.
We are machines that eat and breathe and look really cool.
You're reacting just the way I thought you would.
But I've replaced my heart with metal parts.
And I'm working just fine, but I can't get it to start.
We are machines that breathe and weep and look really good trained to kill.
Send me back in time and I'll bring us back in line.
Just tell me who's mother I have to kill.
I'm fine like I've always been, except I don't remember when
my conscience wasn't acting up again.
But I've replaced my heart with metal parts.
And I'm working just fine, but I can't get it to start.

  todo viene de dentro.
nunca lo que me sacie,
siempre quiero, lobo hambriento.
Todo me queda grande
  para no estar contigo
sabes?, quisiera amarte
siempre un poco mas de lo que te pido.
Sabes que soñare
si no estas, que me despierto contigo
sabes que quiero mas,
no se vivir solo con cinco sentidos.
este mar cada vez guarda mas barcos hundidos
Tu eres aire. yo, papel.
donde vayas yo me ire
si me quedo a oscuras
luz de la locura, ven y alumbrame.
Alguien dijo alguna vez
""por la boca vive el pez""
y yo lo estoy diciendo,
te lo estoy diciendo, otra vez...
Dime porque preguntas
cuanto te he echado de menos
si en cada cancion que escribo,
corazon, eres tu el acento
No quiero estrella errante
no quiero ver la aurora
quiero mirar tus ojos
del color de la coca-cola
Sabes que soñare
si no estas, que me despierto contigo
sabes que quiero mas,
no se vivir solo con cinco sentidos.
este mar cada vez guarda mas barcos hundidos
No estas conmigo siempre que te canto
yo hago canciones para estar contigo
porque escribo igual que sangro
porque sangro todo lo que escribo
Me he dado cuenta, cada vez que canto,
que si no canto no se lo que digo
la pena esta bailando con el llanto
y cuando quiera bailara conmigo
La vida eterna solo dura un rato
y es lo que tengo para estar contigo
para decirte lo que nunca canto
para cantarte lo que nunca digo

To face the loss of the good thing that I've found
oohooh oooooh oohohoh oooooooh 
In the dark of the night I could hear you calling my name
With the hardest of hearts I still feel full of pain
So I drink and I smoke and I ask you if you're ever around
Even though it was me who drove us right in the ground
See the time we shared it was precious to me
But all the while I was dreaming of revelry
Born to run, baby run like a stream down a mountainside
With the wind in my back I don't ever even bat an eye
Just know it was you all along who had a hold of my heart
But the demon and me were the best of friends from the start
So the time we shared it was precious to me
All the while I was dreaming of revelry
Dreaming of revelry
And I told myself boy away you go, it rained so hard it felt like snow
Everything came tumbling down on me
In the back of the woods in the dark of the night
Paleness of the old moonlight everything just felt so incomplete
Dreaming of revelry
Dreaming of revelry
Dreaming of revelry
Dreaming of revelry

And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me (I was confused)

That I'm not the only person with these things in mind (inside of me)
But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I got left to feel. (nothing to lose)
Just stuck, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own.
I want to heal,
I want to feel,
what I thought was never real
I want to let go of the pain I felt so long (Erase all the pain ‘til it's gone)

Looking everywhere only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind (So what am I?)
What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me. (nothing to lose)

myself until I do this on my own

anything else until my wounds are healed
I will never be
anything 'til I break away from me
I will break away,
I'll find myself today

Just eking out my measly pies.

I sink and then I swim all night.

   And leave behind their trail 
Imploring us not to fail.
Of course I raised to gather courage from those 
Lofty tales so tried and true and 
   If you're able I'd suggest it 'cause this 
   Modern thought can get the best of you.

Can save your hide your falling mind

With rotten wood, that decayed from the start
Cause you can't find nothin' at all

and we shared a bed in which I could not sleep at all, woo-hoo woo-hoo-o-o-oo

Made the skyline look like crooked teeth
In the mouth of a man who was devouring us both

But they're closing the bar and they want us to leave

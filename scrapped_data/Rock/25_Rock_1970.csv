And when I fall asleep, I don't think I'll survive the night, the night
'Cause they're waiting for me, they're looking for me, every single night
They're driving me insane, those men inside my brain
The Dream Police, they live inside of my head (live inside of my head)

'Cause they're waiting for me, they're looking for me, every single night
They're driving me insane, those men inside my brain
I try to sleep, they're wide awake, they won't let me alone
They don't get paid to take vacations or let me alone
They spy on me, I try to hide, they won't let me alone
They persecute me, they're the judge and jury all in one

1,Watching The Detectives (ver 2),Elvis Costello,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/elvis-costello/watching-the-detectives-chords-1711363," Nice girls, not one with a defect
 Cellophane shrink-wrapped, so correct
 Red dogs under illegal legs
 She looks so good that he gets down and begs
 She is watching the detectives
 ""Ooh, he's so cute""
 She is watching the detectives
 When they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
 They beat him up until the teardrops start
 But he can't be wounded 'cause he's got no heart
 Long shot at that jumping sign
 Invisible shivers running down my spine
 Cut to baby taking off her clothes
 Close-up of the sign that says ""We never close""
 He snatched at you and you match his cigarette
 She pulls the eyes out with a face like a magnet
 I don't know how much more of this I can take
 She's filing her nails while they're dragging the lake
 She is watching the detectives
 ""Ooh, he's so cute""
 She is watching the detectives
 When they shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot
 They beat him up until the teardrops start
 But he can't be wounded 'cause he's got no heart
 You think you're alone until you realize you're in it
 Now fear is here to stay, love is here for a visit
 Call it instant justice when it's past the legal limit
 Someone's scratching at the window, I wonder who is it?
 The detectives come to check if you belong to the parents
 Who are ready to hear the worst about their daughter's disappearance
 Though it nearly took a miracle to get you to stay
 It only took my little fingers to blow you away
 Just like watching the detectives
 Don't get cute
 It's just like watching the detectives
 I get so angry when the teardrops start
 But he can't be wounded 'cause he's got no heart
 Watching the detectives
 It's just like watching the detectives
 Watching the detectives
 Watching the detectives
 Watching the detectives

Down at Dino's bar and grill

For a pocket full of mumbles such are promises.
All lies and jest,
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest.
When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers,  
In the quiet of a railway station running scared.
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know.
Lie la lie, lie la lie lie, lie la lie,
Lie la lie,
Lie la lie la lie la lie la la la la lie.
Asking only workmans wages
I come looking for a job

I took some comfort there, oeh la la la, la la la laa.
Now the years are rolling by me, 
they are rockin' even me

and younger than I'll be, that's not unusual

And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of Every glove that layed him down
Or cut him till he cried out     
In his anger and his shame,
""I am leaving, I am leaving!""
But the fighter still remains.

and search the world to find
the words to make it right

with you here close to me;
I've got to make you see
That I'm lost without your love,
life without you isn't worth the trouble of
I'm as helpless as a ship without a wheel,
a touch without a feel;
I can't believe it's real...
And someday soon I'll wake,
and find my heart won't have to break
That I'm lost without your love,
life without you isn't worth the trouble of
All I want is just the way it used to be,
I need you here with me
Oh, darlin' can't you see...

we can have it back once more

I come into this life
The son of a woman,
and a man who lived in strife
He was tired of being poor;
and he wasn't into selling door to door
And he worked like the devil to be more
A different kind of poverty now upsets me so
Night after sleepless night,
I walk the floor and I want to know;
why am I so alone?
Where is my woman, can I bring her home?
Have I driven her away?
Is she gone?
Morning comes to sunrise,
and I'm driven to my bed 
I see that it is empty, 
and there's devils in my head
I embrace the many colored beast,
I grow weary of the torment;

There’s a road I’d like to tell you about, lives in my home town
Lake Shore Drive the road is called and it’ll take you up or down
From rags on up to riches fifteen minutes you can fly
Pretty blue lights along the way, help you right on by
And the blue lights shining with a heavenly grace, help you right on by
And there ain't no road just like it
Anywhere I found
Running south on Lake Shore Drive heading into town
Just slippin’ on by on L.S.D., Friday night trouble bound
And it starts up north from Hollywood, water on the driving side
Concrete mountains rearing up, throwing shadows just about five
Sometimes you can smell the green if your mind is feeling fine
There ain’t no finer place to be, than running Lake Shore Drive
And it’s Friday night and you’re looking clean, to early to start the rounds
A ten minute ride from the Gold Coast back make sure you’re pleasure bound
And it’s four o’clock in the morning and all of the people have gone away
Just you and your mind and Lake Shore Drive, tomorrow is another day
And the sunshine’s fine in the morning time, tomorrow is another day

 Take away my inhibitions 
 Take away my solitude
 Fire me up with your resistance
Put me in the mood
 Storm the walls around this prison
 Leave the inmates, Free the guards
 Deal me up another future
From some brand new deck of cards
  Take the chip off of my shoulder
  Smooth out all the lines
  Take me out among the rustling pines
Till it shines
Ah, till it shines
 Like an echo down a canyon
 Never coming back as clear
 Lately I just judge the distance
Not the words I hear
 I've been too long on these islands
 I've been far too long alone
 I've been too long without summer
In this winter home
  Still if we can make the effort
  If we take the time
  Maybe we can leave this much behind
Till it shines
Mmm, till it shines
  See the rich man lost and lonely
  Watch him as he dines
  Sitting there just testing all the wines 
Till it shines
Mmm, till it shines...

Holding you close in my dreams
Thinking about all the things that we said
And coming apart at the seams
We try to talk it over
But the words come out too rough
I know you were trying
To give me the best of your love
Beautiful faces and loud, empty places
Look at the way that we live
Wasting our time on cheap talk and wine
Left us so little to give
That same old crowd
Was like a cold dark cloud
That we could never rise above
But here in my heart I give you the best of my love
Oh oh oh ohhhh sweet darling, you get the best of my love, 
oh oh oh ohhhh sweet darling, you get the best of my love
I'm going back in time
And it's a sweet dream
It was a quiet night
And I would be all right
If I could go on sleeping
But every morning
What's gonna happen today
You see it your way
But we both see it slipping away
You know we always had each other baby
I guess that wasn't enough

I've got no reason to doubt you baby, it's all a terrible mess

Please let out my heart, plea-ease, plea-ease
From behind that locked door
           From behind that locked door
Though you sit in another chair, I can feel you here
Looking like I don't care, but I do, I do
Hiding it all behind anything I see
  Should someone be looking at me
While I occupy my mind, I can feel you here
Love to us is so well timed, and I do, I do
Wasting away these moments so heavenly
  Should someone be looking at me
  Let it down,  let it all down
  Let your hair hang all around me
  Let it down,  let it all down
  Let your love flow and astound me
While you look so sweetly and divine, I can feel you here
I see your eyes are busy kissing mine, and I do, I do
Wondering what it is they're expecting to see
  Should someone be looking at me
  Let it down,  let it all down
  Let your hair hang all around me
  Let it down,  let it all down
  Let your love flow and astound me
  Let it down, let it down, ooh     ooh        ooh
  Let it down, let it down, ooh     ooh        ooh
  Let it down, let it down, ooh     ooh        ooh
          3/4
  4/4
Everyone has choice
When to and not to raise their voices
It's you that decides
Which way you will turn
While feeling that our love is not your concern
It's you that decides
  No-one around you, will carry the blame for you
  No-one around you, will love you today and throw it all away
Tomorrow when you rise
Another day for you to realise me
Or send me down again
As the days stand up on end
You've got me wondering how I lost your friendship
But I see it in your eyes
  Though I'm beside you, I can't carry the lame for you
  I may decide to, get out with your blessing where I'll carry on guessing
Now, how high will you leap
Will you make enough for you to reap it
Only you'll arrive
At your own made end
With no-one but yourself to be offended
It's you that decides
  4/4

   Watch out now
Take care, beware of falling swingers
   Dropping all around you
   The pain that often mingles
In your fingerti-i-ips
Beware of darkness
  Watch out now
Take care, beware of thoughts that linger
    Winding up inside your head
   The hopelessness around you
In the dead of night
Beware of sadness
It can hit you
It can hurt you
 Make you sore and what is more
That is not what you are here for
  Watch out now
Take care, beware of soft shoe shufflers
    Dancing down the sidewalks
   As each unconscious sufferer
Wanders aimlessly
Beware of Maya
  Watch out now
Take care, beware of greedy leaders
  They take you where you should not go
    While weeping atlas cedars
They just want to grow, grow and grow
 Beware of darkness (beware of darkness)
Now I've watched you sitting there
Seen the passers-by all stare
Like you have no place to go
But there's so much they don't know about Apple Scruffs
You've been stood around for years
Seen my smiles and touched my tears
How it's been a long, long time
And how you've been on my mind, my Apple Scruffs
Apple Scru - uffs, Apple Scru - uffs
How I love you, how I love you
In the fog and in the rain
Through the pleasures and the pain
On the step outside you stand
With your flowers in your hand, my Apple Scruffs
While the years they come and go
Now, your love must surely show me
That beyond all time and space
We're together face to face, my Apple Scruffs
Apple Scru - uffs, Apple Scru - uffs
How I love you, how I love you
 Let it roll across the floor
 Through the hall and out the door
To the fountain of perpetual mirth
 Let it roll for what it's worth
 Find me where ye echo lays
 Lose ye bodies in the maze
See the Lord and all the mouths he feeds
Let it roll among the weeds
Let it roll
 Let it roll down through the caves
 Ye long walks of Coole and Shades
Through ye woods here may ye rest awhile
 Handkerchiefs to match your tie
Let it roll
Let it roll.  Let it roll.
Let it roll.  Let it roll.
 Fools' illusions everywhere
 Joan and Molly sweeps the stairs
Eyes that shining full of inner light
 Let it roll into the night
Let it roll.  Let it roll.
Let it roll.  Let it roll.

You don't need no love in
You don't need no bed pan
You don't need a horoscope or a microscope
To see the mess that you're in [break]
If you open up your heart,
You'll know what I mean
We've been polluted so long
Now here's a way for you to get clean
By chanting the names of the lord and you'll be free
The lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
Chanting the names of the lord and you'll be free
The lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
[break]
You don't need no passport
And you don't need no visas
You don't need to designate or to emigrate
Before you can see Jesus   [break]
If you open up your heart
You'll see he's right there
Always was and will be
He'll relieve you of your cares
By chanting the names of the lord and you'll be free
The lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
Chanting the names of the lord and you'll be free
The lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
(break)
You don't need no church house
And you don't need no Temple
You don't need no rosary beads or them books to read
To see that you have fallen  [break]
If you open up your heart
You will know what I mean
We've been kept down so long
Someone's thinking that we're all green
And while the Pope owns 51% of General Motors
And the stock exchange's the only thing
                               he's qualified to quote us
The lord is awaiting on you all to awaken and see
By chanting the names of the lord and you'll be free

Sunrise  doesn't  last  all   morning,
   A cloudburst doesn't last all day
  Seems my love is up and has left you with no warning
  But it's not always going to be this grey
  All things must pass,
 All things must pass     away
Sunset doesn't last   all  evening,
   A mind can blow those clouds away
 After all this my love is up and must be leaving
  It's not always going to be this grey
  All things must pass,
 All things must pass     away
  All things must pass,
  None of life's strings can last
So I must be on my way    and face another day
Now the darkness only stays at  nighttime,
   In the morning it will fade away
 Daylight is good at arriving at the right time
  It's not always going to be this grey
  All things must pass,
 All things must pass    away
  All things must pass,
 All things must pass     away

  I  dig love
  I  dig love
  I  dig love
  I dig love   in the morning
  I dig love   in the evening
  I dig love, and I want you to know
  I  love dig
  I  love dig
  I  love dig
  I love dig   in the morning
  I love dig   every evening
  I dig love, and I want you to know
Small love, big love, I don't care
Love's all good love to me
Left love, right love, anywhere love
There's a rare love
C'mon and get it, it's free
  I  dig love
  I  dig love
  I  dig love
  I dig love   in the morning
  I dig love   in the evening
  I dig love, and I want you to know
Bought love, short love, in any port
Love's always there to see
Make love, take love, but you should give love
And try to live love
Come on that's where you should be
  I  dig love
  I  dig love
  I  dig love
I dig love   in the morning
  I dig love   in the evening
  I dig love, and I want you to know I dig love
              Yes I want you to know I dig love
There'll come a time when all of us must leave here
Then nothing sister Mary can do
  Will keep me here with you
As nothing in this life that I've been trying
Could equal or surpass the art of dying
     Do you believe me?
There'll come a time when all your hopes are fading
When things that seemed so very plain
  Become an awful pain
Searching for the truth among the lying
And answered when you've learned the art of dying
     But you're still with me
     But if you want it
     Then you must find it
     But when you have it
     There'll be no need for it
There'll come a time when most of us return here
Brought back by our desire to be
  A perfect entity
Living through a million years of crying
Until you've realized the art of dying
     Can you believe me?
  Isn't it a pity
  Now, isn't it a shame
 How we break each other's hearts
  And cause each other pain
 How we take each other's love
 Without thinking anymore
  Forgetting to give back
  Isn't it a pity
  Some things take so long
  But how do I explain
  When not too many people
  Can see we're all the same
 And because of all their tears
  Their eyes can't hope to see
  The beauty that surrounds them
  Isn't it a pity
(build-up)
  Isn't it a pity
  Now, isn't it a shame
  How we break each other's hearts
  And cause each other pain
 How we take each other's love
  Without thinking anymore
  Forgetting to give back
  Isn't it a pity
(repeat and fade)

 Out and in there's no place that you're not in
 Won't you hear me lord
Hear me Lord, hear me Lord
Hear me Lord, hear me   Lord
 At both ends of the road
 To the left and the right above and below us
 Out and in there's no place that you're not in
 Won't you hear me lord
 Help me Lord please
To rise a little higher

 Help me Lord please

Higher than any bird ever flew
Longer than there've been stars up in the heavens
I've been in love with you
Stronger than any mountain cathedral
Truer than any tree ever grew
Deeper than any forest primeval
I am in love with you
I'll bring fire in the winter
You'll send showers in the spring
We'll fly through the falls and summers
With love on our wings
Through the years as the fire starts to mellow
Burning lines in the book of our lives
Though the binding cracks, and the pages start to yellow
I'll be in love with you
I'll be in love with you
Longer than there have been fishes in the ocean
Higher than any bird ever flew
Longer than there've been stars up in the heavens
I've been in love with you
I am in love with you

      It just felt so nice,        you and me
    We didn't have a problem or a care  oh no.
    And all around was silence, everywhere
     You are the reason      I was born
      Be with you through all seasons,
      I'll always hear you when you call
    We'll keep the love light shining through
each night and day
   A lonely life behind me,
oh what a change you've made
    So down here on the ocean we will stay
…we will stay…we will stay…
Went through a lot of changes
Turned a lot of pages
 Sunday
    To know you as I know you now,
that is all I need
   And we will get along somehow,
if we both believe
    So down here on the ocean we will stay
…we will stay…we will stay…
Went through a lot of changes
Turned a lot of pages
When I took a boat Sunday

Would you like some affection? Before I leave again.

There's never been any reason, for you to think about me.
Did you have any bad dreams, did you break any glass?
Would you be my companion, is there even a chance?
You've been talking in circles, since I've been able to cry.
There's never been any reason, for ever telling me why, yea, yea.

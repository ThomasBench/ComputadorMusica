0,Stop This Train,John Mayer,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-mayer/stop-this-train-chords-1231540,"No I'm not color blind 
I know the world is black and white
Try to keep an open mind but...
I just can't sleep on this tonight
Stop this train I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
But honestly won't someone stop this train
Don't know how else to say it, don't want to see my parents go
One generation's length away
From fighting life out on my own
Stop this train I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
But honestly won't someone stop this train
So scared of getting older
I'm only good at being young
So I play the numbers game to find away to say that life has just begun
Had a talk with my old man
He said turn 68, you'll renegotiate
Don't stop this train
Don't for a minute change the place you're in
Don't think I couldn't ever understand
John, honestly we'll never stop this train
See once in a while when it's good
It'll feel like it should
And they're all still around
And you're still safe and sound
And you don't miss a thing
'til you cry when you're driving away in the dark.
Singing stop this train I want to get off and go home again
I can't take this speed it's moving in
Cause now I see I'll never stop this train

Will you never try to reach me

The one thing that always tore us apart 
In a sick way I want to thank you 
While I was busy waging wars on myself 
You never doubted my warped opinions 
You made me compliment myself 
So I'll drive so fucking far away 
And do whatever it takes in your heart 
Hate Me today 
Hate me tomorrow 
Hate me for all the things 
I didn't do for you 
Hate me in ways

Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you

Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made 
Like a baby boy I never was a man 
Til I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hand 
And then I fell down yelling make it go away 
Just make a smile come back and shine just like it used to be 
And then she whispered ""how can you do this to me?""

drauf stand, dass der Graf Dracula zum Fest geladen hat.
Eingeladen war ein jeder, auch Dr. Frankenstein,
einzige Bedingung war, es muss ein Monster sein.
Ich stahl ein altes Laken und schnitt zwei Löcher rein
ich dacht mir auf der Party ist's wohl besser Geist zu sein.
Ich packte etwas Knoblauch ein und sattelte mein Pferd
denn so ein Fest bei Dracula ist sicher nicht verkehrt.
Das wird die Monster - Monsterparty - aiaiaiai
Das wird die Monster - Monsterparty - aiaiaiai
Ich kam zum Schloss des Grafen bei Sonnenuntergang.
Ich lachte mir ins Fäustchen, die Nacht wird sicher lang.
Des Unsichtbaren Mütze schwebte vor mir in der Luft
und endlich kam Graf Dracula besoffen aus der Gruft.
Er hob zum Toast sein Glas, der Inhalt war blutrot.
Er lallte noch schnell ""Hallo Freunde"" und fiel um wie tot.
Alle Monster jubelten, die Stimmung war famos.
Die Turmuhr schlug ein letztes Mal, dann ging die Party los.
Das wird die Monster - Monsterparty - aiaiaiai
Das wird die Monster - Monsterparty - aiaiaiai
Plötzlich drang ein jämmerliches Schluchzen an mein Ohr.
Es kam von King Kong vor dem Schloss, er passte nicht durchs Tor.
Das sah Boris Karloff und verhielt sich ziemlich schlau,
sprach ""Wenn King Kong nicht durchs Tor passt, schnapp ich mir die weiße Frau"".
Ich ging auf die Toilette, weil ich Blut nicht so vertrag.
Im Becken schwamm der weiße Hai und sagte ""Guten Tag"".
Auf der Suche nach 'nem Busch dachte ich bei mir:
""Ich glaub ich nehm' die Mumie mit, von wegen Klopapier"".
Das wird die Monster - Monsterparty - aiaiaiai
Das wird die Monster - Monsterparty - aiaiaiai
Basssolo!
Da war so'n widerliches Tier, ich glaub vom andern Stern.
Es sprach zu mir ""Ich heiß E.T. und Partys hab ich gern."".
Ganz besonders schien sich das Skelett zu amüsieren,
es ließ den Werwolf 1000 mal sein Schienbein apportieren.
Doch als ich ""Buh"" rief, kriegten alle Monster einen Schreck
und wer nicht in Ohnmacht fiel, der lief einfach weg.
Ich warf das blöde Laken fort und fühlte mich saustark,
und kotzte noch, bevor ich ging in des Grafen Sarg.
Das war die Monster - Monsterparty - aiaiaiai (8x)

People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time
  Mm mm mm, mm mm mm mmm mmm
  Mm mm mm, mm mm mm mmm mmm
Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around
   And we know it's never simple, never easy
   Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know, like the back of my hand
   Breathe   without you, but I have to
   Breathe   without you, but I have to
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I try to swerve
People are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out
   And we know it's never simple, never easy
   Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know, like the back of my hand
   Breathe   without you, but I have to
   Breathe   without you, but I have to
It's 2 am, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
It's 2 am, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me
   And we know it's never simple, never easy
  Never a clean break, no one here to save me

I spent twelve long months on the lam
That's enough sitting on the fence
For the fear of breaking dams

To put the poison pill to your ear
But now I stand on honest ground, on honest ground
You want to fight for this love
But honey you cannot wrestle a dove
So baby it's clear
You want to jump and dance
But you sat on your hands
And lost your only chance
Go back to your hometown
Get your feet on the ground
And stop floating around

    You’re the kind of girl who can take down a man
And lift him back up again
You are strong, but you’re needy, humble but you’re greedy
And based on your body language and shouted cursive I’ve been reading
Your style is quite selective, but your mind is rather reckless
Well, I guess it just suggests that this is just what happiness is.
  Hey, what a beautiful mess this is.
  It’s like picking up trash in dresses
Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you write
Kind of turn themselves into knives
And don't mind my nerve you can call it fiction
‘Cause I like being submerged in your contradictions dear
‘Cause here we are, here we are
Although you were biased I love your advice
Your comebacks they’re quick and probably have to do with your insecurities
There’s no shame in being crazy, depending on how you take these
Words that paraphrasing this relationship we’re staging
  And it’s a beautiful mess, yes it is
  It’s like, we are picking up trash in dresses
Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you say
Kind of turn themselves into blades
And the kind and courteous is a life I’ve heard
But it’s nice to say that we played in the dirt
Cause here, here we are, Here we are
Here we are, here we are, here we are, here we are
Here we are, here we are, here we are, we’re still here
  And what a beautiful mess this is
  It’s like taking a guess when the only answer is yes
And through timeless words in priceless pictures
We’ll fly like birds not of this earth
And tides they turn and hearts disfigure
But that’s no concern when we’re wounded together
And we tore our dresses and stained our shirts
But it’s nice today, oh the wait was so worth it

Keep your eyes open for a while
In a box high up on the shelf
Left for you no one else

Wrapped in guilt, sealed up tight

And if I'm not there and I'm far away. I said, 
""Don't be afraid."" I said, ""Don't be afraid. We're going home.""

Driving once again
But now this time there were three men
And then I heard one of them say,""I know the night will turn to gray
I know the stars will start to fade
When all the darkness fades away
We had to steal him from his fate So he could see another day.""
Then I cracked open my box
Someone must have picked the lock
A little light revealed the spot Where my fingernails had fought
Then I pushed it open more
Pushing up against the door
Then I sat up off the floor And found the breath I was searching for
Then there were three men up front
All I saw were backs of heads
And then I asked, ""Am I alive and well or am I dreaming dead?""
And then one turned around to say,
""We're driving toward the morning sun
Where all your blood is washed away And all you did will be undone.""

And a box with something in it

Out of the woods but I love
A tree I used to lay beneath
Kissed teeth stained red
From a sour bottle baby girl
With eyes the size of baby worlds
We're the new face of failure
Prettier and younger but not any better off
Bullet proof loneliness
At best, at best

Wipe off that make up what's in is despair, so
Throw on the black dress mixed in with the lot, you might
Wake up and notice you're someone you're not, if you
Look in the mirror and don't like what you see, you can
Find out first hand what it's like to be me, so
Gather 'roung piggies and kiss this goodbye, I'd en-
Courage you're smiles, I'd expect you wont cry!!!
Another contusion my funeral jag, it's
My resignation I'll serve it in drag, you've
Got front row seats to the penitence ball, when I
Grow up I want to be nothing at all!!! I SAY
Hey!!!!!
Hey!!!!! I say
Hey!!!!!
Yeah!!!! c'mon c'mon c'mon I said
Save me (Get me the hell out of here)
Save Me (To young to die and my dear)
You can't (If you can hear me then just walk away and)
Take me!!!

You would've endured my world

A whore in sheep's clothing
Fucking up all I do
And if so here we stop
Then never again
Will you see this in your life
Hang on to the glory at my right hand
Here laid to rest is our love ever longed
With truth on the shores of compassion
You seem to take premise to all of these songs
    You stormed off to scar the armada
Like Jesus played letter,
I'll drill through your hands
The stone for the curse you have blamed me
With love and devotion, I'll die as you sleep
But if you could just write me out
To neverless wonder... happy will I become
Be true that this is no option,
So with sin I condemn you
Demon play, demon out!
Hang on to the glory at my right hand
Here laid to rest is our love ever longed
With truth on the shores of compassion

One more wish to you

47,Miserable At Best (ver 2),Mayday Parade,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/mayday-parade/miserable-at-best-chords-599416,"Katie don't cry I know you're trying your hardest
And the hardest part is letting go  Of the nights we shared
Ocala is calling and you know it's haunting
but compared to your eyes
nothing shines quite as bright
And when we looked to the sky
It's not mine but I want it.    So...
  Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
(I know he's there and)
  You're probably hanging out and making eyes
 I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance she'll say yes
(Because these words were never easier for me to say or
Her to second-guess but I guess)
That I can live without you but
(Without I'll be miserable at best)
  You're all that I hoped I'd find
In every single way
And everything I would give
Is everything you couldn't take
Cause nothing feels like home
You're a thousand miles away
And the hardest part of living
Is just taking breaths to stay
Cause I know I'm good for something
I just haven't found it yet
And I need it,    so...
  Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
(I know he's there and)
  You're probably hanging out and making eyes
 I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance she'll say yes
(Because these words were never easier for me to say or
Her to second-guess but I guess)
That I can live without you but
(Without I'll be miserable at best)
x2 (2nd time with ah dah dahs)
 And this will be the first time in a week
That I'll talk to you and I can't speak
It's been 3 whole days since I've had sleep
Cause I dream of his lips on your cheek
And I got the point that I should leave you alone
But we both know that I'm not that strong
And    I miss the lips that made me fly.     so...
  Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
(I know he's there and)
  You're probably hanging out and making eyes
 I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance she'll say yes
(Because these words were never easier for me to say or
Her to second-guess but I guess)
That I can live without you but
(Without I'll be miserable)
That I can live without you but
(Without I'll be miserable)
That I can live without you but
(Oh without I'll be miserable at best)

 we were always meant to say goodbye...
 Even with our fists held high it, never would have worked out right yeah,
 we were never meant for 'do or die'...
 I didn't want us to burn out, I, didn't come here to hurt you now
 I want you to know, that it doesn't matter where we take this road,
 And I want you to know, you couldn't have loved me better,
 but I want you to move on, so I'm already gone...
 Looking at you makes it harder, but I know that you'll find another,
 that doesn't always make you want to cry...
 Started with a perfect kiss then, we could feel the poison set in,
 perfect couldn't keep this love alive...
 You know that I love you so, I, love you enough to let you go...
 I want you to know, that it doesn't matter where we take this road,
 And I want you to know, you couldn't have loved me better, 
 but I want you to move on, so I'm already gone...

 you can't make it feel right, when you know that its wrong...
 I'm already gone, already gone,
 there's no moving on, so I'm already gone...

1,The Moon,The Microphones,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-microphones/the-moon-chords-2501955,"I drove up to the city at night
And found the place where you grew up
And then where you stayed
And then we walked around and stayed up late
Under city lights; and I spent the night
Next to you in the house where you grew up
Next to you I miraculously woke up
In your parents' house I lied in bed with you
I went back to feel alone there
I went back to wipe it clean
I took the lights and radio towers out of my dreams
And we went all the way up to the small town
Where I'm from; with foggy air and the wind and the mountain tops
And we clung to rocks and we looked off
You held my hand, you almost got to start feeling me
I finally felt like I was breathing free
And under swaying trees we fell asleep and had the same dream
The stars were bright, we dream the same every night
On my island home I spent some time with you
I went back to feel alone there
I went back there by myself
And gave up on everything that we'd felt
We found a precious place in the sand
Right out in the wind, and we lied under a blanket
And heard the furious sound
Two bodies on the earth
It was intense just getting to be there next to you
And you were trying to get me then
And I was happy to let you in
I went back and wished I hadn't
I went back and felt regret
I went to the beach and I stared west
Every night when the sun went down
In the town where we live, the empty streets were lit up
By reflective light from a distant sun
Bouncing off a glowing ball of rock
We just lied on the roof and watched
The moon, the moon, the blue light of the moon
We didn't talk and silently we both felt powerful
Like the moon my chest was full
Because we both knew we're just floating in the same space
Over molten rock, and we felt safe and discovered that our skin is soft
There's nothing left except certain death
And that was comforting at night out under the moon
I went out last night to forget that
I went out and stared it down
But the moon just stared back at me
And in its light I saw my two feet on the ground

Nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or learn some

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and then you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
Listen to the music of the moment people, dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved

It cannot wait, I'm sure
There's no need to complicate, our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Scooch on over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do, our name is our virtue
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours
Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours

Everything is alright.
Oh please tell me that you're alright.
Everything is alright.
I'm sick of the things I do when I'm nervous
like cleaning the oven or checking my tires
or counting the number of tiles in the ceiling.
Head for the hills! The kitchen's on fire!
I used to rely on self medication.
I guess I still do that from time to time,
but I'm getting better at fighting the future.
Someday I'll be fine.
Tell me that you're alright.
Everything is alright.
Oh please tell me that you're alright.
Everything is alright.
Give me a reason
to end this discussion,
to break with tradition,
to fold and divide.
So let's not get carried
away with the process
of elimination.
I don't wanna waste your time!
Tell me that you're alright.
Everything is alright.
Oh please tell me that you're alright.
Everything is alright.
[Everything is fine.] - (3x)
Everything is fine!

Do you want a banana?

Do you want a banana?
Dis banana for you
Tonight we dance around the flame
Then we get to play the spirit game
Shake the thunder from the spirit cloud
All the songbirds in the tree
Chant a tune to let the spirits free
Spirits jumpin' by the fire light

Peel it down and go mm mm mm mm
Do you want a banana? (Do you want a banana)
Dis banana for you
Look you, you're too uptight you know
You can laugh and kick it back and go (weee)
But without a rhythm or a rhyme
You do not banana all the time
Fly away from city on the run
Try to make a little fun
Look you, come to de bungalow
African't you tell me told you so
Don't you love de bumping of de drum
Make you shake until de bum go numb
Let de bongo play you till you drop
Dis banana never stop
Forget all your troubles and go with the flow
Forget about whatever you may never know
Like whether whatever you doing is whatever you should
And whether anything you ever do is ever anything good
And then forget about banana when it stick in your throat
And when it make you wanna bellow but you stuck in a choke
And then forget about de yellow from de beckoning man
Who make you take another one and make a mock of your plan
Bungalay, bungalow
Make up your mind and tell me no
Well it's nine o'clock and it's getting dark
And the sun is falling from the sky
I've never left so early
And you may wonder why
Tomorrow morning on de plane
No banana make you go insane
Floating back to busy town
No banana make you want to frown
Do you want a banana?
Peel it down and go mm mm mm mm
Do you want a banana?

But you know,     how it goes
Blah blah blah blah blah blah, blah-blah-blaaah
All along
Won't you pleeeease stop complaining? I'm playing a song
But all the rain comes down the same   falling to from where it came
On the ground then back around up into the sky
I wish you could've heard the music, when the clouds growled overhead
I finally felt enthusiastic, I finally felt alive
Blah blah blah blah blah blah, blah-blah-blaaah
So you said
Would it pleeeease you to listen, to thunder instead?
Man the rain came down that day    and it drained my soul away
And I wondered why I even bothered to try
Mr. Moon,    tell us about the sky
The sky...is deep..and dark...and eternally high
Many people think that's where you go when you die
Do you?
Well I think you return to obscure
Or wherever you were, before you were
But I won't let you lose yourself in the rain
We have so much left to sing there's a storm for every spring
All you see and you and me became from a star
You're a star,      You're a star
Voice 1: You're a star (Repeat till the end)
Create until nothing is left to create and
The universe bursts with an overworked sigh then
Pretend to pretend to re-crown the creation and
Sing the same thing 'til the clouds start to cry and then
Over and over and over again and then
Over and over and
Never again

and the first to do time, the first of the gang to die, such a silly boy
Hector was the first of the gang with a gun in his hand
and a bullet in his gullet and the first Lost Lad to go under the sod
And he stole from the rich and the poor and the not-very-rich
and the very poor and he stole all hearts away
He stole all hearts away, he stole all hearts away ahay ahay ahay
Away-ahay, he stole all hearts away ... away

While your boyfriends pick up chicks
And darling I'm lost

The trash filled streets made me wish we were heading home.
And there was love inside the basement
Where that woman used to lie
In a sleeping bag we shared
Upon the floor almost every night
And darling I'm drunk
everything that I have loved is turned to stone
So pack your bag and come back home.
And I'm wasted

She'd burn out before I wake
And be replaced by pints of whiskey
Cigarettes, and outer space
If somebody moves
everything you thought you had will go to shit
We've got a lot, don't ever forget that.
And I wrote this on an airplane
Where the people looked like eggs
And when a woman that you loved was gone
She was bombing east Japan
And don't fucking move

We've got a lot, don't you dare to forget that.

        And the morning will come       soon.
        I'll tell you stories of a      better time,
        In a place that we once         knew.
        Before we packed our bags and   left all this
        behind us in the        dust,
        We had a place that we could    call home
And a   life no-one could       touch.
Don't hold me up now,
        I can stand my own ground
        I don't need your help now,
        You won't let me down, down, down.
        Don't hold me up now,
        I can stand my own ground
        I don't need your help now,
        You won't let me down, down, down, dowwwwwwn..
        We are the angry and the desperate,
        The hungry and the cold.
         We are the one's who kept quiet,
        And always did what we were told.
        But we've been sweaty when you slept so calm,
        In the safety of your home.
        We've been pulling out the nails that hold up,
        Everything you've known.
        Don't hold me up now,
        I can stand my own ground
        I don't need your help now,
        You won't let me down, down, down.

        I don't need your help now,
        You won't let me down, down, down, dowwwwwwn..
        So open your eyes, child lets be on our way,
        Broken windows and ashes are guiding the way.
        Keep quiet no longer we'll sing through the     day,
        The lives that we've lost, the lives we've re claimed.
        Don't hold me up now,
        I can stand my own ground
        I don't need your help now,
        You won't let me down, down, down.
        Don't hold me up now,

There's a crane knocking down
All those things that we were

Hear the engines purr
There's a pain, it does ripple
Through my frame, makes me lame
There's a thorn in my side
It's the shame, it's the pride
Of you and me ever-changing
Moving on now, moving fast
And this touch must be wanting
Must become free to act
But I need, Jake to tell you
That I love you, it never rests
And I bled, every day now
For a year, for a year
I did send you a note
On the wind for to read
Our names there together
Must have fallen like a seed
To the depths of the soil
Buried deep in the ground
On the wind I can hear you
Call my name, held the sound

On the last of your pick and mix
Said your mistaken if your thinking that I haven't been caught cold before
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then a flip in your attention in the form of a gobstopper
Is all you have left and it was going to waste
Your past-times, consisted of the strange
The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on it's way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never look like yourself from the side
But your profile did not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne
With folded arms you occupy the bench like toothache
Saw them, puff your chest out like you never lost a war
And though I try so not to suffer the indignity of a reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw
And your past-times, consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called
Crying lightning
And how you like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons
Uninviting
But not half as impossible as everyone assumes
You are crying lightning

Long and weary my road has been
I was lost in the cities, alone in the hills    --------|
 I am not your rolling wheels, I am the highway
 I am not your carpet ride, I am the sky
Friends and liars don't wait for me
‘Cause I'll get on all by myself
I put millions of miles under my heels
And still too close to you I feel, yeah
 I am not your rolling wheels, I am the highway
 I am not your carpet ride, I am the sky
 I am not your blowing wind, I am the lightening
 I am not your autumn moon, I am the night, the night
                                       yeah

She was, a ho___rrible liar
 She couldn't spend, one day alone
But she couldn't, be___ satisfied
When you have, everything
You have every__thing to lose
 She made herself,  a bed of nails
And she's planning, o__n putting it to use
But she wore diamonds on the inside
She wore diamonds on the inside
She has diamonds on the inside
Diamonds
A candle throws its light into the darkness
In a nasty world, so shines, a good deed
 Make sure the fortune,  that you seek
Is the fortu__ne that, you need
 Tell me why,  the first to ask
Is the last, one to give every time
 What you 're saying, and do not mean
Follow__s you, close behind
But she has diamonds on the inside
She wore diamonds on the inside
She has diamonds on the inside  ohh
Diamonds   Diamonds    (on the inside)
Like the soldier long standing, under fire
Any change,  comes as a relief
Let the givers name remain unspo__ken
She is just a generous thief
She wore diamonds on the inside
She has diamonds on the inside
You have diamonds on the inside  ohh
Oh diamonds     (x3)
She wore diamonds on the inside
You have diamonds, diamonds

49,Its Been Awhile,Staind,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/staind/its-been-awhile-chords-21447,"And it's been a while since I could   hold my head up high
And it's been a while since I first saw you.
And it's been a while since I could stand on my own two feet again
And it's been a while since I could call you
And everything I can't remember,
as f***ed up as it all may seem,
the consequences that I've rendered,
I streched myself beyond my means.
And it's been a while since I could say that I wasn't addicted.
And it's been a while since I could say I loved myself as well.
And it's been a while since I've gone and f***ed things up just like I always do.
And it's been a while, but all that sh** seems to disappear when I'm with you.
And everything I can't remember,
as f***ed up as it all may seem,
the consequences that I've rendered,
I've gone and f***ed things up again.
      Why must I feel this way?
Just make this go away.
Just one more peaceful day.
And it's been a while since I could look at myself straight.
And it's been a while since I said I'm sorry.
And it's been a while since I've seen the way the candles light your face.
And it's been a while, but I can still remember just the way you taste.
And everything I can't remember,
As f***ed up as it all may seem to be, I know it's me.
I cannot blame this on my father.
He did the best he could for me.
And it's been a-while since I could hold my head up high.
And it's been a while since I said I'm sorry.

Like a memory it falls
Soft and warm continuing
Tapping on my roof and walls
And from the shelter of my mind
Through the window of my eyes
I gaze beyond the rain drenched streets
To England where my heart lies
My mind's distracted and diffused
My thoughts are many miles away
They lie with you when you're asleep
And kiss you when you start your day
And a song I was writing is left undone
I don't know why I spend my time
Writing songs I can't believe
With words that tear and strain to rhyme
And so you see I have come to doubt
All that I once held as true
I stand alone without beliefs
The only truth I know is you
And as I watch the drops of rain
weave their weary paths and die
I know that I am like the rain
There but for the grace of you go I

Working for the FBI
Sitting in a nest of bad men
Whisky bottles piling high
Bootlegging boozer on the west side
Full of people who are doing wrong
Just about to call up the D.A. man
When I heard this woman singing a song
A pair of 45's made me open my eyes
My temperature started to rise
She was a long cool woman in a black dress
Just a 5'9, beautiful tall
With just one look I was a bad mess
'cos that long cool woman had it all
I saw her headin' to the table
Well a tall walking big black cat
When charlie said I hope that you're able boy
Well I'm telling you she knows where it's at
Well suddenly we heard the sirens
And everybody started to run
A jumping out of doors and tables
Well I heard somebody shooting a gun
Well the da was pumping my left hand
And then she was a-holding my right
Well I told her don't get scared
'cos you're gonna be spared
Well I've gotta be forgiven
Just a 5'9 beautiful tall
Well, with just one look I was a bad mess

But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun
Look out the saints are coming through
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense.
Take what you have gathered from coincidence.
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets.
The sky, too, is folding under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home.
Your empty handed armies, they're all going home.
The lover who just walked out your door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor.
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.
Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you.
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you.
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore.
Strike another match, go start anew
And it's all over now, Baby Blue.

In dreams I walk with you
In dreams I talk to you
In dreams you're mine
All of the time, we're
Together in dreams, in dreams
But just before the dawn
I awake and find you're gone
I can't help it...  I can't help it... if I cry
I remember that you said goodbye
It's too bad that all these things
Can only happen in my dreams
Only in dreams

We all want to change your head

you held my hand so tight,
as you stopped to say hello
Oh, you wished me well, you couldn't tell,
that I'd been . .
Crying  over you
Crying  over you
Then you said so long,
left me standing all alone
Alone and crying, crying, crying, crying
It's hard to understand,
but the touch of your hand,
can start me crying
I thought that I, was over you,
than I did before
But darling, what can I do?
Cause you don't love me,
and I'll always be
Crying  over you
Crying  over you
Yes, now you're gone
And from this moment on
I'll be crying, crying, crying, crying
I'm crying, crying
Oh-oh-oh-over you

Ev'rybody knows,
that Baby's got new clothes
But lately I  see her ribbons and her bows,
have fallen from her curls.
She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl.
Queen Mary, she's my friend,
yes, I believe I'll go see her again
Nobody has to guess, 
that Baby can't be blessed
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest;
with her fog, her amphetamine and her pearls.
She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl.
It was raining from the first,
so I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts,
is this pain in here
I can't stay in here;
I just can't fit
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit
When we meet again,
introduced as friends;
please don't let on that you knew me when,
I was hungry and it was your world.
Ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do
You make love just like a woman, yes, you do
Then you ache just like a woman
But you break just like a little girl.

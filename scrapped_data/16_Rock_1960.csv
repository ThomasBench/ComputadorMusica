And all the people that come and go stop and say hello
On the corner is a banker with a motor car
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain   very strange

There beneath the blue suburban skies  I sit and meanwhile back

And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen

Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play   she is anyway
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain   very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back

Have you near me

Her style is new but the face is the same as it was so long ago,
But from her eyes, a different smile like that of one who knows.
Well, it's been ten years and maybe more since I first set eyes on you.
The best years of my life gone by, here I am alone and blue.
Some people cry and some people die by the wicked ways of love
But I'll just keep on rollin' along with the grace of the Lord above.
People talkin' all around 'bout the way you left me flat,
I don't care what the people say, I know where their jive is at.
One thing I do have on my mind, if you can clarify please do,
It's the way you call me by another guy's name when I try to make love to you.
 Work so hard I couldn't unwind, get some money saved,
 Abuse my love a thousand times, however hard I try.

We sit here stranded, though we're all doing our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain, tempting you to defy it
Lights flicker from the opposite loft,
in this room the heat pipes just cough,
the country music station plays soft,
but there's nothing, really nothing to turn off
Just Louise and her lover so entwined,
and these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind.
In the empty lot where the ladies play blind man's bluff with the key chain
And the all night girls, they whisper of escapades out on the ""D"" train
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight,
ask himself if it's him or them that's really insane
Louise, she's all right, she's just near
She's delicate and seems like the mirror
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear,
that Johanna's not here
The ghost of electricity howls in the bones of her face,
where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place.
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
And when bringing her name up he speaks of a farewell kiss to me
He's sure got a lotta gall,
to be so useless and all,
muttering small talk at the wall,
while I'm in the hall
Oh, how can I explain, it's so hard to get on?
And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn.
Inside the museums, infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo this is what salvation must be like after a while
But Mona Lisa must have had the highway blues, you can tell by the way she smiles
See the primitive wallflower freeze,
when the jelly faced women all sneeze,
hear the one with the mustache say, ""Jeeze, I can't find my knees""
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna they make it all seem so cruel.
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him
Saying' ""Name me someone that's not a parasite,
and I'll go out and say a prayer for him."" But like Louise
always says, ""Ya can't look at much, can ya man?"" as she, herself, 
prepares for him
And Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road,
he writes everything s been returned which was owed,
on the back of the fish truck that loads while my conscience explodes
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain,
and these visions of Johanna are now all that remain.

   The spicks and the specks of the girls on my mind
   Where is the girl I have loved all along
   The girl that I love, she is gone, she is gone
All of my life I - - called yesterday
   The spicks and the specks of my life gone away
   All of my life I - - called yesterday
   The spicks and the specks of my life gone away - Everybody
             Spicks and specks         Spicks and specks              (Rep. & fade)
Where is the sun that shone on my head
The sun in my life, it is dead, it is dead

47,Teacher,Jethro Tull,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jethro-tull/teacher-chords-1415677,"Well the dawn was coming. Heard him ringing on my bell
He said my names the teacher that is what I call myself
And I have a lesson that I must impart to you
Its an old expression but I must insist its true
Jump up look around find yourself some fun
no sense in sitting there hating everyone 
no mans an island and his castle isn't home 
The nest is for nothing when the bird has flown(DOWNSTROKE ONCE FOR C)
So I took a journey threw my world into the sea
With me went the teacher who found fun instead of me
Hey man whats the plan what was that you said
Suntanned drink in hand lying there in bed
I try to socialize but I cant seem to find
What I was looking for got something on my mind
Then the teacher told me it had been a lot of fun
Thanked me for his ticket and all that I had done
Hey man whats the plan what was that you said
suntanned drink in hand lying there in bed
I try to socialize but I cant seem to find
What I was looking for got something on my mind

48,19Th Nervous Breakdown (ver 3),The Rolling Stones,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-rolling-stones/19th-nervous-breakdown-chords-860678,"You're the kind of person you meet at certain dismal dull affairs.
Well, it seems to me that you have seen too much in too few years.
And though you've tried you just can't hide, your eyes are edged with tears.
You better stop,
look around
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown.
When you were a child, you were treated kind, but you were never brought up right.
Your mother who neglected you, owes a million dollars tax.
And your father's still perfecting ways of making sealing wax.
You better stop,
look around
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown.
Oh, who's to blame, 
That girl's just insane.
Well nothing I do don't seem to work,
it only seems to make matters worse, oh please.
You were still in school, when you had that fool, who really messed your mind.
On our first trip, I tried so hard to rearrange your mind.
But after a while I realized you were disarranging mine.
You better stop,
look around
Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Here comes your nineteenth nervous breakdown.
Oh, who's to blame, 
That girl's just insane.
Well nothing I do don't seem to work,
it only seems to make matters worse, oh please.

49,Feeling Alright (ver 2),Joe Cocker,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/joe-cocker/feeling-alright-chords-2608239,"Seems I got to have a change of scene
Every night I have the strangest dreams
Imprisoned by the way it could have been
Left here on my own or so it seems
I got to leave before I start to scream
But someone locked the door and took the key
You feeling alright? (Oh Oh)
I’m not feeling too good myself (Oh Oh)
Yes I’m, feeling alright (Oh Oh)
I’m not feeling that good myself (Oh oh)
Boy you sure took me for one big ride
Even now I sit and I wonder why
And that when I think of you I start myself to cry
I just can't waste my time I must get dry
Got to stop believing in all your lies
Cause there’s too much to do before I die
Hey, you feeling alright? (Oh oh)
I’m not feeling too good myself (Oh oh)
Oh no, you feeling alright?  (Oh Oh)
I’m not feeling too good little girl (Oh oh)
Don't you get too lost in all I say
Yes, but at the time you know I really, felt that way
But that was then and now you know it's today
I can't get set so I guess I'm here to stay
Until someone comes along and takes my place, yeah
With a different name, whoa, and a different face
You feeling alright? (Oh oh)
I’m not feeling that good myself (Oh oh)
You feeling alright? (let them know it) (Oh oh)
Hey, I’m not feeling that good myself (Oh oh)
Woah, I’m feeling alright now (Oh oh)
Yeah, I'm not feeling that good myself (Oh oh)
Aaaahhhh!, (I’m feeling alright Oh oh) (Whoa I’m lonely)
I'm not feeling good myself (oh oh) (You can turn away)
I’m feeling alright (Oh oh)
I'm not feeling too good myself (I’ll tell you) (oh oh)
Oh, I’m feeling all right now (Oh oh)
Hey, I’m not feeling that good right now

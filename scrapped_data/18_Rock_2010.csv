You're careful with your words, but I'm pulling teeth
You said this wouldn't hurt, give me cavities and
All of your apologies are only empty calories
After all this time, I start askin' why i'm stayin'
Were you ever mine? Are we something that's worth savin'
Every conversation puts me back on medication
Sometimes, sorry's just another word you're sayin'
   Do I look like her, does she talk like me?
Been' feeling insecure, co-dependency is
 Hard to break when you, never make it easy
 Reconstructive surgery, can't fix my anxiety

I said young people fall in love

That's alright, that's okay

When you're really just in pain
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end it's better for me
That's the moral of the story babe

It's funny how a memory
Turns into a bad dream
When running wild turns volatile
Remember how we painted our house
Just like my grandparents did
So romantic but we fought the whole time
Should've seen the signs yeah
Talking with my mother
Said some people fall in love
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you’re in love
When you're really just in pain
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end it's better for me

They say it's better to have loved and lost
Than never to have loved at all
That could be a load of shit

Cause love’s hard to find.
Maybe the days we had are gone,
Living in silence for too long,
Open your eyes and what do you see,
No more laughs,
Turning slowly,
Looking back, see,
No-one can save this,
You’re broken and I’m pissed,
Run along like I’m supposed to,
Be the man I ought to,
Rock and Roll sent us insane,
I hope someday that we will meet again.

Giving it everyone,

And a kiss that I kept
Under my vest
Apart from everything but the heart in my chest

Could be there's nothing else in our lives so critical as this little home
My life in an upturned boat
Marooned on a cliff
You brought me a great big flood
And you gave me a lift
Girl, what a gift. And you tell me with your tongue and you're breath was in my lungs
And you float over the rift

Shoot through my mind and I can’t let go

Caught up in a moment
Can you see inside?
And there’s a hurricane underneath it
Trying to keep us apart
I write with a poison pen
But these chemicals moving between us
Are the reason to start again
Now I'm holding on for dear life
There’s no way that we could rewind 
Maybe there’s nothing after midnight
That could make you stay
But now that I’m broken
And now that you know it
Caught up in a moment
Can you see inside?
Cuz I’ve got a jet black heart
And there’s a hurricane underneath it
Trying to keep us apart
I write with a poison pen
But these chemicals moving between us
Are the reason to start again
(Woah, woah)
 The blood in my veins is made up of mistakes
 Let's forget who we are and dive into the dark
 As we burst into color we turn into life
Cuz I’ve got a jet black heart
And there’s a hurricane underneath it
Trying to keep us apart
I write with a poison pen
But these chemicals moving between us
Are the reason to start again
 (The blood in my veins is made up of mistakes
 Let's forget who we are and dive in to the dark)

From cutting yourself with the jagged edge

Take it from someone whose been where you're at
Laid out on the floor and your not sure
You can take this anymore
So just give it one more try to a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And you can't tell I'm scared as hell
Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes (close your eyes)
Well honey here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby
Please let me take you
Out of the darkness and into the light
Cause I have faith in you
That you're gonna make it through another night
Stop thinking about the easy way out
There's no need to go and blow the candle out
Because you're not done you're far too young
And the best is yet to come
So just give it one more try to a lullaby

47,Kathleen,Catfish and the Bottlemen,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/catfish-and-the-bottlemen/kathleen-chords-1471678,"You're simpatico
And of all the lift homes and all the mixed feelings
You're cuts above
And you don't own worries or a chest full of heartache
Yes, I know
That I'll never work out exactly how you're thinking
But let me know, when I'm needed home
And I'd come
You can leather me with your lips
I've gotta give it to you
You give me problems
When you are not in the mood
I've gotta give it to you
You give me problems
And made me give into you
Our dealer hates me you know
He used to see her but she sold
Him off on down the river
It's impractical
To go out and catch a death with a dress fit for the summer
So you don't
Instead you call me up with a head full of filth 
Yes, I know
I'll never acquiesce anything you're thinking
But let me know, when I'm needed home
And I'd come
You can leather me with your lips
I've gotta give it to you
You give me problems
When you are not in the mood
I've gotta give it to you
You give me problems
And made me give into you
Our dealer hates me you know
He used to see her but she sold
Him off on down the river

Suddenly tomorrow's moment washed away
Cuz I don't have a reason and you don't have the time
But we both keep on waiting for something we won't find
The light on the horizon is brighter yesterday
Shadows floating over, scars begin to fade
We said it was forever but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
The final masquerade
All I've ever wanted, the secrets that you keep
All you've ever wanted, the truth I couldn't speak
Cuz I can't see forgiveness, and you can't see the crime
If we both keep on waiting for what we left behind
The light on the horizon is brighter yesterday
Shadows floating over, scars begin to fade
We said it was forever but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
The final masquerade, the final masquerade
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday
With shadows floating over, scars begin to fade
We said it was forever but then it slipped away
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
Standing at the end of the final masquerade
The final masquerade

 Oh I ask you why not always

 Be my only, be the water where I’m wading

 I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you, dark boom honey
 I follow you
 Here's a message, I’m the runner
 He’s the rebel, I’m the daughter waiting for you

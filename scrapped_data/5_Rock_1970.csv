0,Hurricane,Bob Dylan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bob-dylan/hurricane-chords-14871,"Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
  She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
 Cries out ""My God they killed them all!""
  Here comes the story of the Hurricane
  The man the authorities came to blame
  For something that he never done
  Put in a prison cell but one time 
He could have been the champion of the world
  Three bodies lyin’ there does Patty see
And another man named Bello, movin’ around mysteriously
  “I didn’t do it,” he says, and he throws up his hands
“I was only robbin’ the register, I hope you understand
  I saw them leavin’,” he says, and he stops
  “One of us had better call up the cops”
  And so Patty calls the cops
  And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin’
In the hot New Jersey night
Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin’ around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
  When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
  Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that’s just the way things go
If you’re black you might as well not show up on the street
’Less you wanna draw the heat
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin’ around
He said, “I saw two men runnin’ out, they looked like middleweights
Jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”
  And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said, “Wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”
So they took him to the infirmary
  And though this man could hardly see
They told him he could identify the guilty men
  Four in the mornin’ and they haul Rubin in
They took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs
The wounded man looks up through his one dyin’ eye
""Say, why’d you bring him in here for?  He ain’t the guy!”
  Yes, here’s the story of the Hurricane
  The man the authorities came to blame
  For somethin’ that he never done
  Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world
  Four months later, the ghettos are in flame
Rubin’s in South America fightin’ for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley’s still in the robbery game
And the cops are puttin’ the screws to him lookin’ for somebody to blame
  “Remember that murder that happened in a bar?
  Remember you said you saw the getaway car?
You think you’d like to play ball with the law?
Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw runnin’ that night?
Don’t forget that you are white.”
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, “I’m really not sure”
The cop said, “A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job and we’re talkin’ to your friend Bello
You don’t wanta have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow
  You’ll be doin’ society a favor
  That sonofabitch is brave and gettin’ braver
  We want to put his ass in stir
  We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain’t no Gentleman Jim”
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
It’s my work, he’d say, I do it for pay
And when it’s over I’d just as soon go on my way
  Up to some paradise
  Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
  And ride a horse along a trail
  But then they took him to the jailhouse
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse
All of Rubin’s cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
The judge made Rubin’s witnesses drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
  And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
  No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
  And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed
  Rubin Carter was falsely tried
The crime was murder “one.”  Guess who testified?
  Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the papers, they all went along for the ride
  How can the life of such a man
  Be in the palm of some fool’s hand?
  To see him obviously framed
  Couldn’t help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
Where justice is a game
Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell
  Yes, that’s the story of the Hurricane
  But it won’t be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he’s done
  Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world
                    (fade)

Weather's good there in the fall
I've got some friends that I can go working for
Still I wish you'd change your mind
If I ask you one more time
But we've been through that a hundred times or more
Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high
All those things that don't change,
come what may
If  the good times are all gone
Then I'm bound for moving on
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way
If I get there before the snow flies,
And if things are looking good
You could meet me if I sent you down the fare
But by then it would be winter
Not too much for you to do
And those winds sure can blow cold way out there
Four strong winds that blow lonely
Seven seas that run high

    And everyone turns to see
    This beautiful lady
    Is walking around with me
    And then she asks me
    Do you feel alright?
    And I say yes, I feel wonderful tonight
    I feel wonderful
    Because I see the love light in your eyes
    And the wonder of it all
    Is that you just don’t realize
    How much I love you
    It’s time to go home now
    And I’ve got an aching head
    So I give her the car keys
    And she helps me to bed
    And then I tell her
    As I turn out the light
    I say my darling, you were wonderful tonight
    Oh my darling, you were wonderful tonight

47,Changes (ver 2),David Bowie,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/david-bowie/changes-chords-820041,"                             Oh yeah
  Still don't know what I was waiting for
And my time was running wild
  A million dead-end streets and
  Every time I thought I'd got it made
It seemed the taste was not so sweet
So I turned myself to face me
But I've never caught a glimpse
Of how the others must see the faker
I'm much too fast to take that test
  Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
Turn and face the strange
  Ch-ch-Changes
  Don't want to be a richer      man
  Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
Turn and face the strange
  Ch-ch-Changes
  It's gonna have to be a      different man
       Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I watch the ripples change their size
But never leave the stream of warm impermanence
And so the days float through my eyes
But still the days seem the same
And these children that you spit on
As they try to change their worlds
Are immune to your consultations
They're quite aware of what they're going through
  Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
Turn and face the strange
  Ch-ch-Changes
  Don't want to be a richer      man
  Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
Turn and face the strange
  Ch-ch-Changes
  It's gonna have to be a      different man
       Time may change me
But you can't trace time
Strange fascination, fascinating me
Changes are taking the pace I'm going through
Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-Changes
Look out you rock'n'rollers
Ch-ch-ch-ch-Changes
Turn and face the strange
Ch-ch-Changes
Pretty soon now you're gonna get older
Time may change me
But I can't trace time
I said that time may change me
But I can't trace time

48,Its Too Late (ver 3),Carole King,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/carole-king/its-too-late-chords-1170337,"Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time
There's something wrong here, there can be no denying
One of us is changing, or maybe we just stopped trying
And it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
It used to be so easy living here with you
You were light and breezy and I knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool
And it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it, no no
There'll be good times again for me and you
But we just can't stay together, don't you feel it too
Still I'm glad for what we had, and how I once loved you
And it's too late, baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it, no no
It`s too late, darling, it’s too late, baby, it’s too late

49,Breathe,Pink Floyd,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/pink-floyd/breathe-chords-5244,"Breathe, breathe in the air 
Don't be afraid to care 
Leave, but don't leave me 
Look around and chose your own ground 
For long you live and high you fly 
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry 
And all you touch and all you see 
Is all your life will ever be 
Run, run rabbit run 
Dig that hole, forget the sun 
And when at last the work is done 
Don't sit down, it's time to start another one 
For long you live and high you fly 
But only if you ride the tide 
And balanced on the biggest wave 
You race toward an early grave.
Home, home again 
I like to be there when I can 
When I come in cold and tired 
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire 
Far away across the field 
The tolling of the iron bell 
Calls the faithful to their knees 
To hear the softly spoken magic spells.

And I tell the truth when truth comes to call
And I try to walk that narrow way
Sometimes I go over the lines
And I won't make it back till the next day
But I cast no stones
What gives you the right
To tell me my business
Good God man, you're out of your mind
So put up your bible
Or let me get mine
I'm not draggin' the whole world to hell
Man you're wastin' my time
I don't talk with Jesus as much as I should
I don't read that good book everyday like I could
But I like to stop at the end of the day
And I pray that I hurt nobody
And somebody new found their way
And I cast no stones
What gives you the right
To tell me my business
Good God man, you're out of your mind
So put up your bible
Or let me get mine
I'm not draggin' the whole world to hell
Man you're wastin' my time
I cast no stones
What gives you the right
To tell me my business
Good God man, you're out of your mind
So put up your bible
Or let me get mine
I'm not draggin' the whole world to hell
Man you're wastin' my time
So say a prayer for me brother and I'll see you on down the line

Oh, half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got the right mind to tell you that
I can`t keep loving you
Oh, half of my heart

  I made a plan, stayed the man who can only love himself
Lonely was the song I sang
'Til the day you came
Showing me a better way and all that my love can bring

Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got the right mind to tell you that
I can`t keep loving you
Oh, half of my heart   with half of my heart
Your faith is strong
But I can only fall so far so long
Time to hold, later on
You will hate that I never gave more to you
than half of my heart
But I can't stop loving you
But I can't stop loving you
But I can't stop loving you

Half of my heart's got you

6,Kickapoo (ver 3),Tenacious D,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tenacious-d/kickapoo-chords-1866031,"A long ass fuckin' time ago, In a town called Kickapoo,
There lived a humble family, Religious through and through.
But yay there was a black sheep, And he knew just what to do.
His name was young J.B., and he refused to step in-line.
A vision he did see-th, Fucking rocking all the time.
He wrote a tasty jam, And all the planets did align.
Oh the dragon's balls were blazin', As I stepped into his cave.
Then I sliced his fuckin' cockles, With a long and shiny blade!
Twas I who fucked the dragon, Fuckalizing fuckaloo!      
And if you try to fuck with me, Then I shall fuck you too!
Gotta get it on in the party zone!
I gots to shoot a load in the party zone!
Gotta lick a toad in a party zone!
Gotta suck a chode in the party zone!
You've disobeyed my orders son, Why were you ever born?
Your brother's ten times better than you, Jesus loves him more.
This music that you play for us Comes from the depths of hell.
Rock and roll's the devil's work, He wants you to rebel.
You'll become a mindless puppet; Beelzebub will pull the strings!
Your heart will lose direction, And chaos it will bring.
You'd better shut your mouth, You better watch your tone!
You're grounded for a week with no telephone!
Don't let me hear you cry, Don't let me hear you moan!
You gotta praise The Lord when you're in my home!
Dio can you hear me? I am lost and so alone...
I'm askin' for your guidance, Won't you come down from your throne?    
I need a tight compadre Who will teach me how to rock.    
My Father thinks you're evil, But man, he can suck a cock.   
Rock is not the devil's work, It's magical and rad.  
I'll never rock as long as I am Stuck here with my Dad...
I hear you brave young Jables, You are hungry for the rock.
But to learn the ancient method, Sacred doors you must unlock.  
Escape your father's clutches, On this oppressive neighborhood.                 
On a journey you must go, To find the land of Hollywood!    
In The City of Fallen Angels, Where the ocean meets the sand,   
You will form a strong alliance, And the world's most awesome band!    
To find your fame and fortune, Through the valley you must walk.   
You will face your inner demons. Now go my son and rock!
So he bailed from fuckin' Kickapoo With hunger in his heart.
And he journeyed far and wide To find the secrets of his art
But in the end he knew That he would find his counterpart.

It just won't happen

Who looked like someone you might knock about with
And almost shouted 
And then reality kicked in within us
It seems as we become the winners

And half wonder if you won it at all
And don't say 'owt 'cause you've got no idea

With prayers for rain on their lips

come on get higher
loosen my lips
faith and desire
and the swing of your hips
just pull me down hard
and drown me in love
come on get higher
loosen my lips
faith and desire
and the swing of your hips
just pull me down hard
and drown me in love
come on get higher
loosen my lips
faith and desire
and the swing of your hips
just pull me down hard
and drown me in love
come on get higher
loosen my lips
faith and desire
and the swing of your hips
just pull me down hard
and drown me in love

48,Tonight,FM Static,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/fm-static/tonight-chords-549830,"I remember the times we spent together on those drives
We had a million questions all about our lives
and when we got to New York everything felt right
I wish you were here with me
tonight
I remember the days we spent together were not enough
and it used to feel like dreamin' except we always woke up
Never thought not having you here now would hurt so much
Tonight I've fallen and I can't get up
I need your loving hands to come and pick me up
And every night I miss you I can just look up
and know the stars are holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
tonight
I remember the time you told me about when you were eight
And all those things you said that night that just couldn't wait
I remember the car you were last seen in and the games we would play
All the times we spilled our coffees and stayed out way too late
I remember the time you sat and told me about your Jesus
and how not to look back even if no one believes us
When it hurt so bad sometimes not having you here...
Tonight I've fallen and I can't get up
I need your loving hands to come and pick me up
And every night I miss you I can just look up
and know the stars are holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
tonight
Tonight I've fallen and I can't get up
I need your loving hands to come and pick me up
And every night I miss you I can just look up
and know the stars are holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
tonight

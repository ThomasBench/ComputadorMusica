Standin' to my Daddy's knee
My poppa said, ""Son, don't let the man get you an'
Do what he done to me""
'Cause he'll get you
'Cause he'll get you mama
And I can remember the fourth of July
Runnin' through the backwood, bare
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin'
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou, Lord, Lord
Wish I was back on the bayou
Rollin' with some Cajun queen
Wishin' I were a fast freight train
Just a chooglin' on down to New Orleans
Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou
And I can remember the fourth of July
Runnin' through the backwood, bare
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin'
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou
Born on the bayou

There must be some kind of way out of here
Said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Business men they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None will level on the line
Nobody offered his word
No reason to get excited
The thief he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour's getting late
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside in the cold distance
A wild cat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl

Of a now late afternoon
As the sun shines through the curtain lace
And shadows wash the room
And we sit and drink our coffee
Cast in our indifference, like shells upon the shore
You can hear the ocean roar
In the dangling conversation, and the superficial sighs
The borders of our lives
And you read your Emily Dickenson
And I my Robert Frost
And we note our place with bookmarkers
That measure what we've lost
Like a poem poorly written
We are verses out of rhythm, Couplets out of rhyme
In syncopated time
And the dangling conversation, And the superficial sighs
Are the borders of our lives
Yes we speak of things that matter
With words that must be said
Can analysis be worthwhile
Is the theater really dead?
And how the room is softly faded
And I only kiss your shadow, I cannot feel your hand
You're a stranger now unto me
Lost in the dangling conversation, And the superficial sighs
In the borders of our lives

Into the magic night....I softly say..
a silent prayer, like dreamers do.
Then I fall asleep to dream....my dreams of you.
In dreams, I walk with you....in dreams, I talk, to you.
In dreams you're mine....all of the time, we're to..get..her,
in dreams, in dreams.
But, just before the dawn...I awake, and find you gone.

happen in my dreams.

Brighton, I must have played them all. But I ain't seen nothin like him in
any amusement hall, that deaf dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pin-ball!
He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine. Feeling all the bumpers,
always playing clean. Plays by intuition, the digit counters fall, that deaf 
dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pin-ball!
He's a pin-ball wizard, there has to be a twist. A pin-ball wizard's got such 
a supple wrist
How do you think he does it? (I don't know) What makes him so    good?
Ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes and bells. Don't see no lights a-
flashin', plays by sense of smell. Always gets a replay, you never see him fall, 
that deaf dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pin-ball!
Thought I was the Bally table king but I just handed my pinball crown to 
him.
Even on my favourite table he can beat my best. His disciples lead him in 
and he just does the rest. He's got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him fall,

We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing
As majestic bells of bolts, struck shadows in the sounds
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing
Flashing for the warriors, whose strength is not to fight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
And for each and every underdog, soldier in the night
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
Even though a cloud s white curtain in a far off corner flashed
And the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
Electric lights still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless seeking trail,
For the lonesome hearted lovers, with too personal a tale
And for each unharmful gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
Starry eyed and laughing, as I recall when we were caught
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
And we listened one last time, and we watched with one last look
Spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended
Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed
For the countless confused, accused, misused, srung-out ones and worse
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

Sell your soul to the company, who are waiting there, to sell plastic ware

was it all a strange game you're a little insane?

They say that every man must fall 
Yet I swear I see my reflection 
Somewhere so high above this wall 
I see my light come shining 
From the west down to the east  
Any day now, any day now 
I   shall be released 
Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd  
A man who swears he's not to blame  
All day long I hear him shouting so loud  
Just crying out that he was framed
I see my light come shining 
From the west down to the east  
Any day now, any day now 
I   shall be released 
Any day now, any day now 
I   shall be released

Where I'm no fun anymore
I am sorry
Sometimes it hurts so badly
I must cry out loud
I am lonely
I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
And you make it hard.
Remember what we've said and done and felt
About each other
Oh babe, have mercy
Don't let the past remind us of what we are not now
I am not dreaming.
I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard.
Tearing yourself, away from me now
You are free, and I am crying
This does not mean, I don't love you
I do, that's forever, 
Yes and for always
I am yours, you are mine
You are what you are
You make it hard.
Something inside is telling me that
I've got your secret.
Are you still listening?
Fear is the lock, and laughter the key to your heart
And I love you
I am yours, you are mine, you are what you are
You make it hard
And you make it hard x3
And you make it hard
Friday evening, Sunday in the afternoon
What have you got to lose?
Tuesday morning, please be gone I'm tired of you.
What have you got to lose?
Can I tell it like it is? (Help me I'm suffering)
Listen to me baby. 
It's my heart that's a suffering (Help me I'm dying)
It's a dying, that's what I have to lose
I've got an answer
I'm going to fly away
What have I got to lose?
Will you come see me Thursdays and Saturdays?
What have you got to lose?
Chestnut brown canary
Ruby throated sparrow
Sing the song, don't be long
Thrill me to the marrow.
Voices of the angels, ring around the moonlight
Asking me, said she so free
How can you catch the sparrow?
Lacy, lilting, leery, losing love, lamenting
Change my life, make it right
Be my lady.

Picks up the letter that's lying there.

She breaks down and cries to her husband ""Daddy our baby's gone!""

Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one
Good luck had just stung me, to the race track I did go
She bet on one horse to win and I bet on another to show
The odds were in my favor, I had 'em five to one
When that nag to win came around the track, sure enough we had won

If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one
I took up all of my winnings, and I gave my little Bessie half
And she tore it up and threw it in my face, just for a laugh
Now there's one thing in the whole wide world, I sure do like to see
That's how that little sweet thing of mine, dips her doughnut in my tea
Up on Cripple Creek she sends me
If I spring a leak she mends me
I don't have to speak, she defends me
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one
Now me and my mate were back at the shack, we had Spike Jones on the box
She said, ""I can't take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk""
Now that just gave my heart a throb, to the bottom of my feet
And I swore as I took another pull, my Bessie can t be beat

I don't have to speak, she defends me

Now there's a flood out in California and up north it's freezing cold
And this living off the road is getting pretty old
So I guess I'll call up my big mama, tell her I'll be rolling in
But you know, deep down, I'm kind of tempted

 In the U.S.A.
And if she could only hear me
This is what I'd say
Honey pie, you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home
Oh honey pie, my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
of your Hollywood song
You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee
Oh honey pie, you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong, honey pie come back to me
I like it like that, ooh
    I like this kind of hot kind of music
Hot kind of music
Just play it to me
Play it to me Hollywood Blues
Will the wind that blew her boat
Across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me
Honey pie, you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home
Come, come back to me honey pie

People carry roses,
Make promises by the hours,
My love she laughs like the flowers,
Valentines can't buy her.
In the dime stores and bus stations,
People talk of situations,
Read books, repeat quotations,
Draw conclusions on the wall.
Some speak of the future,
My love she speaks softly,
She knows there's no success like failure
And that failure's no success at all.
The cloak and dagger dangles,
Madams light the candles.
In ceremonies of the horsemen,
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
Statues made of match sticks,
Crumble into one another,
My love winks, she does not bother,
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
The bridge at midnight trembles,
The country doctor rambles,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
The wind howls like a hammer,
The night blows cold and rainy,
My love she's like some raven
At my window with a broken wing.

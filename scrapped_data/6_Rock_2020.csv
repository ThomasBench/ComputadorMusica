I was just a child
Working through
Fears of the night
Then you flew
Over to my side
And then I knew
It had always been right
To give
To love
To stay
In touch
To give
Enough
To love
Till it lasts forever
Till it lasts so long
Till we’re back together
I’ll be alone
Till it lasts forever
Till it lasts so long
Till we’re back together
Now I’m leaving you
For the both of us
To find something new
Cause were not enough
And all I can do
Is to know
That we
Could meet
Again
Sometime
When we
Could be
The end
Till it lasts forever
Till it lasts so long
Till we’re back together
I’ll be alone
Till it lasts forever
Till it lasts so long
Till we’re back together
I’ll be alone
Till it lasts forever
Till it lasts so long
Till we’re back together
I’ll be alone
Till it lasts forever
Till it lasts so long
Till we’re back together
I’ll be alone

  Sleepin' through your days and skippin' meals
But I guess it's different when it's the norm
  Sinking deeper into whatever this is without a hint of reflection
Can't tell if this is the calm or if this is
the storm
  Giving everything I've got
Equates to about a shower and wakin' up late
Faced with anything I tend to flee
  So when I'm thrown into the adult world

Experiments and sacrilege in the name of public good
They taught me everything, just like a daddy should
And you were beautiful and vulnerable and power and success
God damn, I fell for you, your flamethrowers, your tunnels, and your tech
I studied code because I wanted to do something great like you
And the real tragеdy is half of it was true
But we've been fuckin' mеan, we're elitist, we're as flawed as any church
And this faux-rad West coast dogma has a higher fuckin' net worth
I bit the apple 'cause I trusted you
It tastes like Thomas Malthus
Your proposal is immodest and insane
And I hope someday Selmers rides her fuckin' train
I loved you, I loved you, I loved you, it's true
I wanted to be you and do what you do
I lived here, I loved here, I thought it was true
I feel so stupid, and so used
  I feel so used
I was your baby, your first born, the hot girl in your compsci class
I was darwin's prep school dream bred, born, and raised to kick your ass
I fell for circuit boards, rocket ships, pictures of the stars
If you could only be what you pretend you are
When I said take me to the moon I never meant take me alone
I thought if mankind toured the sky it meant that all of us could go
But I don't wanna see the stars if they're just one more piece of land
For us to colonize for us to turn to sand
'Cause we're so fuckin' mean, we're so elitist, we're as fucked as any church

So when I speak, you bet your life my words are true
Let me level with you man, as someone guilty of the game
I took the help, I took the cash, I would've taken your last name
So if any girl on Earth should get to make a call about this,
it should be me, and as I see it, you're a dick
So fuck your tunnels, fuck your cars, fuck your rockets, fuck your cars again
You promised you'd be Tesla, but you're just another Edison
'Cause Tesla broke a patent, all you ever broke were hearts

Looking at the sky I see the city lights
But no star fights

When out of silence we will sing
And even broken bells will ring

Yet we still play thе game

Going nowhere soon
Between the cracks of sidewalk there's a flower grown
Beyond the stone

You'd gone to meet your maker

Not one of them a keeper

I know I'd try and find the will to be strong

Together forever but forever and on
Is still not long enough, still not long enough
You look confused in your eyes
And I could see myself as a child
Such a devastating feeling
I wished I could go back in time
But all I could do was apologize
Right then your eyes were healing
Healing

Yeah, she'd shake and she'd shimmy like Elvis singin' ""All Shook Up""
But you can't blame a boy for going, drive it like you stole it fast
With your window down, brown hair, blowin' look at me like that
A turned up radio but the static was heavy
Couldn't make out any words but ""take me to the levee""
That look on your face was full of wild desire
Soakin' my soul in gas and settin' my heart on fire
A heart on fire
A heart on fire
A heart on fire
I don't have a single second thought that doesn't have you in it
To feel those flames again, I'd go back in a New York minute
I miss the freedom of you dancing on the bow of your daddy's old boat
When my spirit starts sinkin' that picture always makes it float baby
We weren't old enough to drink but we damn sure did it
Hat turned backward singin' ""Paradise City""
That look on your face was full of young desire
Soakin' my soul in gas and settin' my heart on fire
Heart on fire
Turned up the radio but the static was heavy
Couldn't make out any words but ""take me to the levee""

La casa si allaga di nuovo e nessuno che apre la porta
Bionda come il grano, sorride di un vago ricordo
Si siede, affronta la cena da sola e nessuno la sente
Ma come un lago ad alta quota si gode il tempo che ha
Prima che il ghiaccio la ricopra, prima dell'oscurità
E questa sera è un po' diversa, segue la scia delle persone
Segue la scia dei suoi pensieri e se ne va
Sembra come pane, si cuoce la testa allo specchio
Le gambe le vede più grandi di un tempo
Si chiede se è giusto che guardino tutto
Sembra come chiese, rocce vacanti di preti
I santi che pregano in coro per allontanare fantasmi
Ma come un lago ad alta quota si gode il tempo che ha
Prima che il ghiaccio la ricopra, prima dell'oscurità
E questa sera è un po' diversa segue la scia delle persone
Segue la scia dei suoi pensieri
Dolce inverno, dolce agonia
Prendi il sole, portalo via
Ti accolgo fra le mie braccia anche se non ti vorrei
Ti stringo forte ed aspetto il giorno che te ne andrai
Non può nascondersi da questa tempesta
Non si dimentica se non ci si pensa
Non c'è bisogno di cambiare bandiera
A volte basta solo accenderla
Ma come un lago ad alta quota si gode il tempo che ha
Prima che il ghiaccio la ricopra, prima dell'oscurità
E questa sera è un po' diversa, segue la scia delle persone
Segue la scia dei suoi pensieri

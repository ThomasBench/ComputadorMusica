0,Hasnt Hit Me Yet,Blue Rodeo,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/blue-rodeo/hasnt-hit-me-yet-chords-62224,"You say that you're leaving
Well that comes as no suprise
Still I kinda like this feelin
Of being left behind
Yea this aint nothin new to me
Well it's just like goin home
It's kinda like those sunsets
That leave you feelin so stoned
Hey Hey I guess it hasn't hit me yet
I fell thru this crack
And I kinda lost my head
I stand transfixed
Before this street light
Watching the snow fall on this co-old December night
I never thought this could happen
But somehow the feeling is gone
You got sick of the patterns
And I got lost in this song
Hey Hey I guess it hasn't hit me yet
I fell thru this crack
And I kinda lost my head
I stand transfixed
Before this street light
Watching the snow fall on this co-old December night
Hey Hey I guess it hasn't hit me yet
I fell thru this crack
And I kinda lost my head
I stand transfixed
Before this street light
Watching the snow fall on this co-old December night
And out in the middle of Lake Ontario
The same snow is falling
On the deep silent water
The great dark wonder
Into the waves of my heart
Into the waves of my heart

1,Dublin In The Rare Old Times,The Dubliners,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-dubliners/dublin-in-the-rare-old-times-chords-1059856,"Raised on songs and stories
Heroes of reknown
The passing tales and glories
That once was Dublin town
The hallowed halls and houses
The haunting children's rhymes
That once was part Dublin 
In the rare old times
Ring a ring a rosie
As the light declines
I remember Dublin City
In the rare old times
My name it is Sean Dempsey
As Dublin as could be
Born hard and late in Pimlico
In a house that's ceased to be
By trade I was a cooper
Lost out to redundancy
Like my house that fell to progress
My trade's a memory
I courted Peggy Diagnam
As pretty as you please
A gentle child of Mary
From the rebel liberties
I lost her to a student chap
With skin as black as coal
When he took her off to Birmingham
She took away my soul
Ring a ring a rosie
As the light declines
I remember Dublin City
In the rare old times
The years have made me bitter
The gargles dims me brain
'Cause Dublin keeps on changing
And nothing stays the same
The Pillar and the Met have gone
The Royal long since pulled down
As the great and unyielding concrete
Makes a city of my town
Ring a ring a rosie
As the light declines
I remember Dublin City
In the rare old times
Fare thee well sweet Anna Liffey
I can no longer stay
And watch the new glass cages
That spring up along the quay
My mind's too full of memories
Too old to hear new chimes
I'm a part of what was Dublin
In the rare old times
Ring a ring a rosie
As the light declines
I remember Dublin City
In the rare old times

  But you can't see his blood
  It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog
Kicked up
   It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning, in the flood
  You see I've always been a fighter
But without you
I'd give up
   Now I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby that's just me
Yeah...I
Will love you
Baby
Always, and I'll be there
Forever and a day
Always
I'll be there
Till the heavens burst
I know when I die
And I'll love you
Always
Now the pictures that
Are just memories
Some that made us laugh
One that made you
Have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers
  Touch your lips
When you say your prayers
I've made mistakes
I'm just a man
When he holds you close
When he says the words
I wish, I was him
To say to you
Till the end of time
Yeah...I
Will love you
Baby
Always, and I'll be there
Forever and a day
Always
  If you told me to cry for you
  I could
  If you told me to die for you
I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you
Well there ain't no luck
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our own dreams and our own lives
We'll find a place
Where the sun still shines
Yeah...I
Will love you
Baby
Always, and I'll be there
Forever and a day
Always
I'll be there
Till the heavens burst
I know when I die
And I'll love you
Always

I saw her first and knew
That her dark hair would weave a snare,
that I might one day rue
I saw the danger and I passed,
along the enchanted way,
and I said: 'Let grief, be a fallen leaf
at the dawning of the day'
On Grafton Street in November,
we tripped lightly along the ledge
Of a deep ravine, where can be seen,
the worth of passion's pledge
The Queen of Hearts, still making tarts,
and I not making hay
Oh, I loved too much and by such,
by such, is happiness thrown away
I gave her gifts of the mind,
I gave her the secret signs
That's known to the artists who have known,
the true gods of sound and stone
And word and tint, without stint,
I gave her poems to say
With her own name there, and her own dark hair,
like clouds over fields of May
On a quiet street, where old ghosts meet,
I see her walking now
Away from me so hurriedly,
my reason must allow
That I had loved, not as I should,
a creature made of clay
When the angel woos the clay,
he'd lose, his wings at the dawn of day

Those nights and those dreams

If I could make the earth and my dreams the same

47,Hey Now,Oasis,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/oasis/hey-now-chords-1926465,"I hitched a ride with my soul
Just as the sky turned black
I took a walk with my fame
I never did find my way back
You know that I gotta say time's slipping away
And what will it hold for me
What am I gonna do while I'm looking at you
You're standing ignoring me
I thought that I heard someone say now
There's no time for running away now
Hey now! Hey now!
Feel no shame - cos time's no chain
Feel no shame
The first thing I saw
Was a sign on the wall that read
It said you might never know
What is written inside of your head
And time as it stands
Or living inside of my skin
And as it fell from the sky
Can I never let anyone in ?
I thought that I heard someone say now
There's no time for running away now
Hey now! Hey now!
Feel no shame - cos time's no chain
Feel no shame
Feel no shame - cos time's no chain
Feel no shame
I hitched a ride with my soul
Just as the sky turned black
I took a walk with my fame
I never did find my way back
You know that I gotta say time's slipping away
And what will it hold for me
What am I gonna do while I'm looking at you
You're standing ignoring me
I thought that I heard someone say now
There's no time for running away now
Hey now! Hey now!
Feel no shame - cos time's no chain
Feel no shame

  And there's no easy way out
   The day's moving just too fast for me
  I Need some time in the sunshee-ine
  Gotta slow it right down
   The day's moving just too fast for me
I live my life for the stars that shine
People say it's just a waste of time
Then they said I should feed my head
That to me was just a day in bed
I'll take my car and drive real far
They're not concerned about the way we are
In my mind my dreams are real
Now you concerned about the way I feel
Toniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight I'm a rock n' roll star
Toniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight I'm a rock n' roll star
  I live my life in the city
  And there's no easy way out
   The day's moving just too fast for me

  Gotta slow it right down

Look at you now, you're all in my hands Tonight

They burn with fire, until the end of time
And I would give anything, I'd beg, I'd steal, I'd die
To have you in these arms tonight
Baby I want you, like the roses want the rain
You know I need you, Like the poet needs the pain
And I would give anything, my blood, my love, my life
If you were in these arms tonight
I'd Hold you, I'd need you
I'd get down on my knees for you
And make everything alright
If you were in these arms
I'd love you, I'd please you
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you
And love you till the end of time
If you were in these arms tonight
We'd stare at the sun, and we made a promise
A promise this world, would never blind us
And these were our words, our words were our songs
Our songs are our prayers, these prayers keep me strong
And I still believe if you were in these arms
I'd Hold you, I'd need you
I'd get down on my knees for you
And make everything alright
If you were in these arms
I'd love you, I'd please you
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you
And love you till the end of time
If you were in these arms tonight
Your clothes are still scattered all over our room
This whole place still smells like your cheap purfume
Everything here reminds me of you
There's nothing I wouldn't do
And these were our words, they keep me strong, baby.....
I'd Hold you, I'd need you
I'd get down on my knees for you
And make everything alright
If you were in these arms
I'd love you, I'd please you
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you
And love you till the end of time
If you were in these arms tonight
If you were in these arms..

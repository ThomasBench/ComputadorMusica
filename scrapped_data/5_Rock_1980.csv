Always in time, but never in line for dreams
Head over heels when toe to toe
This is the sound of my soul,
This is the sound
I bought a ticket to the world,
But now I've come back again
Why do I find it hard to write the next line?
Oh, I want the truth to be said
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is true
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is true
With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue
Dissolve the nerves that just begun
Listening to Marvin (all night long)
This is the sound of my soul,
This is the sound...
Always slipping from my hands,
Sands of time I've been told
Take your seats and I'll write the next line
Oh, I want the truth to be known
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is true
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh
I know this much is true
I bought a ticket to the world,
But now I've come back again

1,When Doves Cry (ver 2),Prince,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/prince/when-doves-cry-chords-1883772,"Dig if you will the picture
Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you my darling
Can you picture this?
Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you
How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
Touch if you will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride
How can you just leave me standing?

And pretty loud
My cat is purring
And scratches my skin
So what is wrong
With another sin
The bitch is hungry
She needs to tell
So give her inches
And feed her well
More days to come
New places to go
I've got to leave
It's time for a show
Here I am,
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am,
Rock you like a hurricane
My body is burning
It starts to shout
Desire is coming
It breaks out loud
Lust is in cages
Till the storm breaks loose
Just have to make it
With someone I choose
The night is calling
I have to go
The wolf is hungry
He runs the show
He's licking his lips
He's ready to win
On the hunt tonight
For love at first sting

It boils with every poison
You can think of
And I'm underneath the street light
The delight of joy I know
Scared beyond belief
Way down in the shadows
And the perverted fear of violence
Chokes the smile on every face
Common sense is ringing out the bells
This ain't no technological breakdown
Oh no, this is the road to hell
And all the roads jam up with credit
And there's nothing you can do
It's all just bits of paper
Flying away from you
Oh, look out world, take a good look
What goes down here
You must learn this lesson fast, and learn it well
This ain't no upwardly mobile freeway
Oh no, this is the road

I want a ticket to anywhere.
Maybe we make a deal,
Maybe together we can get somewhere.
Any place is better.
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose.
Maybe we'll make something,
Me myself, I got nothing to prove.
You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here:
I been working at the convenience store,
Managed to save just a little bit of money.
Wont't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city,
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living.
You see my old man's got a problem:
He live with the bottle, that's the way it is.
He says his body's too old for working,
His body's too young to look like his.
My mama went off and left him,
she wanted more from life than he could give,
I said, ""Somebody's got to take care of him.""
So I quit school and that's what I did.
You got a fast car
But is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision:
Leave tonight or live and die this way.
 I remember when we were driving, driving in your car,
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk,
  City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder.
And I_____ had a feeling that I belonged
And I_____ had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone.
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourelves;
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl.
I know things will get better:
You'll find work and I'll get promoted,
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs.
 I remember when we were driving, driving in your car,
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk,
  City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder.
And I_____ had a feeling that I belonged
And I_____ had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone.
You got a fast car
And I got a job that pays all our bills.
You stay out drinking late at the bar,
See more your friends than you do your kids.
I'd always hoped for better,
Thought maybe together you and me would find it,
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere,
so take your fast car and keep on driving.

Carried away by a moonlight shadow.

Far away on the other side.
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
And she couldn't find how to push through
The trees that whisper in the evening
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
All she saw was a silhouette of a gun
Far away on the other side.
He was shot six times by a man on the run
And she couldn't find how to push through
I stay
I pray
I see you in heaven far away
I stay
I pray
I see you in heaven One day
Four am in the morning
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
I watched your vision forming
Carried away by a moonlight shadow
Star was light in a silvery night
Far away on the other side
Will you come to talk to me this night
But she couldn't find how to push through
I stay

I see you in heaven far away

us somehow free. He taught me what to say in school, I learned
it off by heart but now that's torn in two.

all of this strife. So come to me when I'm asleep, we'll cross
the lines and dance upon the streets.

through my heart but I'll bear it again. Oh, I thought we were

Oh, I don't know when love was gone. But in this troubled land
desperation keeps us strong. Friday's child so full of soul
 with nothing left to lose there's everything to go.

Just like the white-winged dove sings a song sounds like she's singin
Ooh baby Ooh said Ooh
And the days go by like a strand in the wind 
In the web that is my own I begin again
Said to my friend, Baby, nothing else mattered
He was no more (he was no more) than a baby then
Well he   seemed broken-hearted
Something within him
But the moment that I first laid eyes on him
All alone on the edge of    seventeen
Just like the white-winged dove sings a song sounds like she's singin
Ooh baby Ooh said Ooh
Just like the white-winged dove sings a song sounds like she's singin
Ooh baby Ooh said Ooh
Well I went today maybe I will go again tomorrow
Yeah yeah, And the music there well it was   hauntingly familiar
When I see you doin what I try to do for me
With the   words from a poet and a voice from a choir
And a melody,   nothin else mattered
Just like the white-winged dove sings a song sounds like she's singin
Ooh baby Ooh said Ooh
Just like the white-winged dove sings a song sounds like she's singin

The clouds never expect it when it rains but the sea   changes color
But the sea   does not change
So with the slow graceful glow of age
I went forth with an age-old desire to please
On the edge of seventeen

Just like the white-winged dove sings a song sounds like she's singin

Well then suddenly there was no one left standin in the hall
Yeah Yeah, in a flood of tears that no one really ever heard fall at all
Well I went searchin for an answer up the stairs and down the hall
Not to find an answer but just to hear the call of a nightbird
Singin come away, (come away, come away)
Just like the white-winged dove sings a song sounds like she's singin
Ooh baby Ooh said Ooh
Just like the white-winged dove sings a song sounds like she's singin

Well I hear you in the mornin' and I hear you at nightfall

what love and life were all about.
Then you came,
You brought me out of the shell;
You gave the world to me
And before I knew,
There I was so in love with you.
You gave me a reason for my being
And I  love what I'm feelin'
You gave me a meaning to my life,
Yes, I've gone beyond existing
And it   all be--gan      
when I met you.
I love the touch of your hair
And when I look in your eyes
I just know, I know I'm on to something good
And  I'm  sure
my love for you will endure
Your love will light up my world;
And take all my cares
away with the aching part of me.
You gave me a reason for my being
And I  love what I'm feelin'
You gave me a meaning to my life,
Yes, I've gone beyond existing
And it   all be--gan      
when I met you.
You taught me how to love,
You showed me how tomorrow and
today my life is diff'rent from the yesterday;
And you, you taught me to love
And darling I will always cherish you
Today, tomorrow and forever.
And  I'm  sure
when evening comes around
I know we'll be making love
like never before;
My love, who could ask for more?
You gave me a reason for my being
And I  love what I'm feelin'
You gave me a meaning to my life,
Yes, I've gone beyond existing
And it   all be--gan      
when I met you
When I met you----.
You gave me a reason for my being
And I  love what I'm feelin'
You gave me a meaning to my life,
Yes, I've gone beyond existing
And it   all be--gan      
when I met you
When I met you.

What are those words whispered baby     just as you turn away
I saw you last night            out on the edge of town
I wanna read your mind    to know just what I've got 
in this new thing I've found
So tell me what I see          when I look in your eyes
Is that you baby  or just a brilliant disguise
I heard somebody call your name          from underneath our willow
I saw something tucked in shame    underneath your pillow
Well I've tried so hard baby           but I just can't see
What a woman like you                   is doing with me
So tell me who I see          when I look in your eyes
Is that you baby  or just a brilliant disguise
Now look at me baby         struggling to do everything right
And then it all falls apart           when out go the lights
I'm just a lonely pilgrim        I walk this world in wealth
I wanna know if it's you I don't trust  'cause I damn sure don't trust myself
Now you play the loving woman           I'll play the faithful man
But just don't look too close           into the palm of my hand
We stood at the altar           the gypsy swore our future was right
But come the wee wee hours     Well maybe baby the gypsy lied
So when you look at me      you better look hard and look twice
Is that me baby   or just a brilliant disguise
Tonight our bed is cold          I'm lost in the darkness of our love
God have mercy on the man          Who doubts what he's sure of

   As we're both lying here
   There's so many things I wanna say
   I will always love you
   I would never leave you alone
   Sometimes I just forget
   Say things I might regret
   It breaks my heart to see you crying
   I don't want to lose you
   I could never make it alone
I am a man who would fight for your honor
I'll be the hero you're dreaming of
We'll live forever knowing together
That we  did it all  for the glory of love
   You keep me standing tall
   You help me through it all
   I'm always strong when you're beside me
   I have always needed you
   I could never make it alone
I am a man who would fight for your honor
I'll be the hero you're dreaming of
We'll live forever knowing together
That we  did it all  for the glory of love

   Just in time I will save the day

Eleanor rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from ?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong ?
Father mckenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
Look at him working. darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Ah, Look at all the lonely People
Ah Look at All the lonely people
Eleanor rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Father mckenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

When I wake up early in the morning, lift my head I'm still yawning.
When I'm in the middle of a dream, stay in bed float upstream.
Please don't wake me no don't shake me leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy, I don't mind I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed 'til they find there's no need
Please don't spoil my day I'm miles away and after all
I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window,
Taking my time
Lying there and staring at the ceiling, waiting for a sleepy feeling 
Please don't spoil my day I'm miles away and after all
I'm only sleeping                    
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window,
Taking my time
When I wake up early in the morning, lift my head I'm still yawning.
When I'm in the middle of a dream, stay in bed float upstream.
Please don't wake me no don't shake me leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping
Each day just goes so fast I turn around it's past
  Love me while you can         Before I'm a dead old man
Each day time is so short         A new one can't be bought
  Make love all day long            Make love sing-ing a song
There's people standing round    Who'll screw you in the ground
  I'll make love to you             If you want me to
  Make love all day long            Make love sing-ing a song
  To lead a better life,
  I need my love to be here
Here,      making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand,
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There,     running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her 
everywhere     knowing that love is to share,
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes, and hoping I'm always there     
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her 
everywhere     knowing that love is to share,
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes, and hoping I'm always there     
I will be there,    and everywhere
Here, there, and everywhere
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
  In the land of submarines
So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine 
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
And our friends are all on board
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play
As we live a life of ease
   Everyone of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
   In our yellow submarine

And you're making me feel like I've never been born

Everything was right

Even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave

But you don't get me
You don't get me
You say you've seen seven wonders
But you can't see me
You can't see me

Start to weigh you down
Look in my direction
I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round
When your bird is broken
will it bring you down
You may be awoken,

 Your day breaks, your mind aches
 You find that all the words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you
 She wakes up, she makes up
 She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you
And in her eyes you see nothing
 No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
  A love that should have lasted years
 You want her, you need her
 And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
You think she needs you
And in her eyes you see nothing
 No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
  A love that should have lasted years
 You stay home, she goes out
 She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
She doesn't need him
 Your day breaks, your mind aches
 There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her
And in her eyes you see nothing
 No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
  A love that should have lasted years

I want to tell you
my head is filled with things to say
When you're here, all those words
they seem to slip away
When I get near you
the games begin to drag me down
It's alright, I'll make you maybe 
next time around
But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me, it's not my mind
that is confusing things
I want to tell you 
I feel hung up and I don't know why
I don't mind, I could wait forever
I've got time
Sometimes I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe you'd understand.
I want to tell you 
I feel hung up and I don't know why
I don't mind, I could wait forever
I've got time
I've got time
I've got time . . .
  I was alone I took a ride, I didn't know what I would find there
  Another road where maybe I can see another kind of mind there
Ooh     then I suddenly see you
Ooh     did I tell you I need you
Every  single day of my life
  You didn't run you didn't lie you I wanted just to hold you
  And had you gone you'd knew in time we meet again for I'd have told you
Ooh     you were meant to be near me
Ooh     and I want you hear me
Say we'll be together every day
Got to get you into my life           [break]
  What can I do? What can I be when I'm with you I wanna stay there
  If I'm true I'll never leave and if I do I know the way there
Ooh     then I suddenly see you
Ooh     did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life
Got to get you into my life           [break]
Got to get you into my life           [break]
I was alone I took a ride, I didn't know what I would find there [RIFF]
  Another road where maybe I can see another kind of mind there
Then suddenly see you
  Did I tell you I need you
   Every  single day 
Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream,
It is not dying, it is not dying?
Lay down all thought, surrender to the void,
Is it shining? Is it shining?
That you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being
Love is all and love is everyone
Is it knowing? Is it knowing?
That ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing?
But listen to the colour of your dreams
Is it not living, is it not living?

You better watch what you do to me
Don t get carried away
Girl, if you can do better than me
Go...yeah, go
Good love is hard to find
Good love is hard to find
You got lucky, babe
You got lucky, babe
When I found you
You put a hand on my cheek
And then you turn your eyes away
If you don t feel complete
If I don t take you all of the way
Then go, yeah, go,
Good love is hard to find
Good love is hard to find
You got lucky, babe
You got lucky, babe
When I found you
Yeah go,
Just, go,
Good love is hard to find
Good love is hard to find
You got lucky, babe
You got lucky, babe

I've been blossoming alone over you
And I hear my heart breaking tonight
I hear my heart breaking tonight
Oooh, Do you hear it too?
It's like a summer shower
With every drop of rain singing
""I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you!""
I could stare at your back all day
I could stare at your back all day
And I know I've kissed you before, but
    I didn't do it right
Can I try again, try again, try again
Try again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again?

1,Wir Ziehen In Den Frieden,Udo Lindenberg,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/udo-lindenberg/wir-ziehen-in-den-frieden-chords-2498409,"Artikel 3: Niemand darf wegen seines Geschlechtes, seiner Abstammung, seiner Rasse, seiner Sprache, seiner
Heimat und Herkunft, seines Glaubens, seiner religiösen oder politischen Anschauungen oder seiner
sexuellen Orientierung benachteiligt oder bevorzugt werden.
Ich steh vor Euch mit meinen alten Träumen
Von Love und Peace und jeder Mensch ist frei.
Wenn wir zusammen aufstehen könnte es wahr sein.
Es ist soweit, ich frag bist Du dabei?
Wir haben doch nicht die Mauer eingerissen,
Damit die jetzt schon wieder neue bauen.
Komm lass uns jetzt die Friedensflagge hissen.
Wir werden dem Krieg nicht länger tatenlos zuschauen.
Komm wir ziehen in den Frieden!
Wir sind mehr als Du glaubst.
Wir sind schlafende Riesen,
Aber jetzt stehen wir auf.
Lass Sie ruhig sagen, dass wir Träumer sind.
Am Ende werden wir gewinnen.
Wir lassen diese Welt nicht untergehen -
Komm wir ziehen in den Frieden
Wir sind doch alle Blutschwestern und Brüder.
Wir sind ne große Menschenfamily.
Wir brauchen keine machtgeilen Idioten
Mit ihrem Schmiergeld von der Waffenindustrie.
Ich hör John Lennon singen ""Give Peace A Chance""
Und es klingt wie'n Vermächtnis aus dem All.
Damit das Weltgewissen endlich aufhört,
Denn es ist 5 Sekunden vor dem großen Knall -
Aber wir sind überall!
Komm wir ziehen in den Frieden!
Wir sind mehr als Du glaubst.
Wir sind schlafende Riesen,
Aber jetzt stehen wir auf.
Lass Sie ruhig sagen das wir Träumer sind.
Am Ende werden wir gewinnen.
Wir lassen diese Welt nicht untergehen -
Komm wir ziehen in den Frieden!
Komm wir ziehen in den Frieden!
Komm wir ziehen in den Frieden!
Wir sind mehr als Du glaubst.
Wir sind schlafende Riesen,
Aber jetzt stehen wir auf
Und die Mission ist erst erfüllt,
Wenn keiner mehr den andern killt.
Wir lassen diese Welt nicht untergehn!
Komm wir ziehen in den Frieden!
Überall diese Kriege,
Da kann niemand gewinnen.
Stell Dir vor es ist Frieden
Und jeder, jeder geht hin.

Gently wrapped around me

If I still believe that hearts don't lie
You're gonna be just fine
But, babe
  A lot's gonna change

 Try to leave it all behind
In your lifetime
  Born in a century lost to memories
Falling trees, get off your knees
No one can keep you down

Sadly don't stick around
It's high time you learned to get by

In your lifetime
 Try to leave it all behind

Show me where it hurts

Discovering the patterns of my soul and where it's placed
I've been mapping many caverns but it still feels like a maze
I know I'm made of clay that's worn
Blighted by imperfect form
But I will trust the artist molding me
 I am creation, both haunted and holy
Made in glory
Even the depths of the night cannot blind me
When You guide me
Creature only
Look inside my heart and find a perilous ravine
Carved within the beauty, the darkness in between
Standing in the balance of complete and incomplete
I identify the echo of what is and what will be
I know I'm made of clay that's worn
Blighted by imperfect form
But I will trust the artist molding me
(aah-ah-ah)
In a room that's growing dim
Illuminated from within
The pull of tension's empathy
 I am creation, both haunted and holy
Made in glory
Even the depths of the night cannot blind me

 I am creation, both haunted and holy
Made in glory
Even the depths of the night cannot blind

I'm trying to see when it's unclear
Hidden in the space between
Hero and the enemy
Early days and sleepless nights
Death and resurrection, life
My body is a sacred note
Sung between the flesh and hope
My dirt transformed within a breath
Before I took a single step
I'm looking forward to the day
When life can grow without decay
Humanity is not alone
When Jesus Christ sits on the throne
These hidden mirrors expose the mess
The selfish turns to selflessness
Haunted by a darker side
Transcends to walking in the light
And slowly I'm recovering
The beauty of discovery
   I mean, that amount of glory does sound reasonably glorious

Où un rien nous détourne du simple instant présent
Alors que tout s'envole
  Avec le temps
Malgré la mort, celle qui frappe et qui nous fait pleurer
Ou bien celle qui un jour, tôt ou tard, nous fauchera
Je m'accroche les pieds
  Ici-bas
Malgré l'amour celui qui nous fait vivre d'espoir
Qui parfois fait si mal quand on reste sur le seuil
D'une trop courte histoire
  Sans qu'on le veuille
Malgré la haine qui souvent nous retombe sur le nez
Et les caves qui s'abreuvent de ce triste crachat
Je m'accroche les pieds
  Ici-bas
Ici-bas
  Tant que mes yeux s'ouvriront
Je cherch'rai dans l'horizon
La brèche qui s'ouvre sur mes décombres
La lueur dans les jours plus sombres
Tant que mes pieds marcheront
J'avancerai comme un con
Avec l'espoir dans chaque pas
Et ce jusqu'à mon dernier souffle
Ici-bas
Malgré les merdes, les revers, les choses qui nous échappent
Les p'tits, les grands tourments, les erreurs de parcours
Et tout c'qui nous rattrape

La routine, le cynisme, l'hiver qui finit pas

I feed and water an idea so I let it grow
I tell them take it easy, they laugh and tell me ""no""
It’s cool but I don’t see them laughin' at my money though
They spittin' facts at me, I’m spittin' tracks, catch me?
I’m spinning gold out my records know you can’t combat me
They tell me Jesus walks, I tell them money talks
Bling got me chill, 'cause I’m living in an ice box
They tell me I've been sleepin', I say I’m wide awake
Tracks hot and ready so they call me mister e-z bake
They say the grass is greener, I think my grass is dank
Drivin' with a drank on an empty tank to the bank
Do you feel me? Take a look inside my brain
The people always different but it always feels the same
That’s the real me, pop the champagne
The haters wanna hurt me and I’m laughin' at the pain
Stayin' still, eyes closed
Let the world just pass me by
Pain pills, nice clothes
If I  fall I think I’ll fly
Touch me, Mi-das
Make me part of your design
None to guide us
I feel fear for the very last time
They tell me that I’m special, I smile and shake my head
I’ll give them stories to tell friends about the things I said
They tell me I’m so humble, I say I’m turning red
They let me lie to them and don’t feel like they’ve been misled
They give so much to me, I’m losing touch, get me?
Served on a silver platter, ask for seconds they just let me
They tell me I’m a God, I’m lost in the facade
Six feet off the ground at all times I think I’m feelin' odd
No matter what I make, they never see mistakes
Makin' so much bread, I don’t care that they’re just being fake
They tell me they’re below me, I act like I’m above
The people blend together but I would be lost without their love
Can you heal me? Have I gained too much?
When you become untouchable you’re unable to touch
Is there a real me? Pop the champagne
It hurts me just to think and I don’t do pain
Stayin' still, eyes closed
Let the world just pass me by
Pain pills, nice clothes
If I  fall I think I’ll fly
Touch me, Mi-das
Make me part of your design
None to guide us

Lay still, restless
Losing sleep while I lose my mind (Yeah)
All thrill, no stress
All my muses left behind (Left behind)

So high up, I’m near divine (I'm so high up)

Calls to mind a silver screen
And all its sad goodbyes

I'm sorry that you never made it
And it pains me to hear you have to say it
You knew the game and played it
It kills me to know that you have been defeated
I see the wires pulling while you're breathing
You knew you had a reason it killed you like diseases
I could hear it in your voice while you're speaking
He can't be treated, Mr.-Know-It-All had his reign and his fall
At least that is what his brain is telling all
If he said, help me kill the president
I'd say he needs medicine,
Sick of screaming let us in
The wires got the best of him,
and all that he invested in,
goes Straight to hell, Straight to hell, (oh oh oh woah oh oh)
Straight to hell, straight to hell
He told me, I should take it in
Listen to every word he's speaking
The wires getting older
I can hear the way they're creaking
As their holding him
I could see it in his jaw
that all he ever wanted was a job
He tells me to be raw
admits to every little flaw
that never let him sit at the top,
Don't tell me to stop
Thinks that I should be a little cautious,
I can tell the wires were pulled
If he said, help me kill the president
I'd say he needs medicine,
Sick of screaming let us in
The wires got the best of him,
and all that he invested in,
goes Straight to hell, Straight to hell, (oh oh oh woah oh oh)
Straight to hell, straight to hell
I've been having trouble in believing
I just started seeing,
light at the beginning of the tunnel
But he tells me that I'm dreaming,
When he talks I hear his ghosts
Every word they say to me,
I just pray the wires aren't coming
If he said, help me kill the president
I'd say he needs medicine,
Sick of screaming let us in
The wires got the best of him,
and all that he invested in,
goes Straight to hell, Straight to hell, (oh oh oh woah oh oh)
Straight to hell, straight to hell
     Straight to hell, Straight to hell, (oh oh oh woah oh oh)
Straight to hell, straight to hell

How can I say this without taking over
How can I put it down into words
When it's almost too much for my soul alone
I loved and I loved and I lost you
I loved and I loved and I lost you
I loved and I loved and I lost you
And it hurts like hell
Yeah it hurts like hell
I don't want them to know the secrets
I don't want them to know the way I loved you
I don't think they'd understand it, no
I don't think they would accept me, no
I loved and I loved and I lost you
I loved and I loved and I lost you
I loved and I loved and I lost you
And it hurts like hell
Yeah it hurts like hell
Dreams fight with machines
Inside my head like adversaries
Come wrestle me free
Clean from the war
Your heart fits like a key
Into the lock on the wall
I turn it over, I turn it over
But I can't escape
I turn it over, I turn it over
I loved and I loved and I lost you
I loved and I loved and I lost you
I loved and I loved and I lost you
And it hurts like hell

49,Lotus Flower,Radiohead,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/radiohead/lotus-flower-chords-1053726,"I will shape myself into your pocket
Do what you want
Do what you want
I will shrink and I will disappear
I will slip into the groove and cut me off
And cut me off
There's an empty space inside my heart
So now I'll set you free
I'll set you free
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cos all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart
We will shrink and be quiet as mice
do what we want
Do what we want
There's an empty space inside my heart
So now I'll set you free
I'll set you free
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
The bird that's flown into my room
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cos all I want is the moon upon a stick
I dance around the pit
The darkness is beneath
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart

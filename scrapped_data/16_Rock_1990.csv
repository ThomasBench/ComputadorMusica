Here comes that feeling I've seen in your eyes
Back in the old days before the hard times
But I'm not afraid anymore
it's only a broken heart
I know the place where you keep your secrets
Out of the sunshine down in a valley
But I'm not afraid anymore
it's only a broken heart
What would I give
to start all over again
to clean up my mistakes
Stand in the moonlight, stand under heaven
Wait for an answer, hold out forever
But don't be afraid anymore
It's only a broken heart
What would I give
to start all over again
to clean up my mistakes
I know your weakness, you've seen my dark side
The end of the rainbow is always a long ride
But don't be afraid anymore
It's only a broken heart

de la tierra, las raices,
del amor, donde estaban,
quedaran.
Entre no me olvides,
me deje nuestros abriles,
olvidados,
en el fondo del placard,
del cuarto de invitados,
eran tiempos dorados,
un pasado mejor...

y te digo poco a poco, no me mientas,
no me digas la verdad,
no te quedes callada,
no levantes la voz,
ni me pidas perdon...
Aunque casi te confieso
que tambien he sido un perro
compañero, un perro ideal,
que aprendio a ladrar, y a
volver al hogar,
para poder comer...

Polly wants a cracker

Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm here 
Gotta find a way - a better way - I had better wait 
Never met a wise man, if so it's a woman

Gotta find a way - a better way - I had better wait 
Gotta find a way, to find a way, when I'm here

One baby to another said,
I'm lucky to have met you
I don't care what you think
Unless it is about me
It is  now my duty to completely drain you
A travel through a tube
And end up in your infection
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
in a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours because I like you
With eyes so dilated,
I've became your pupil
You've taught me everything
Without a poison apple
The water is so yellow,
I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful -
Vacuum out the fluids
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
in a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours because I like you
One baby to another said,
I'm lucky to have met you
I don't care what you think
Unless it is about me
It is  now my duty to completely drain you
A travel through a tube
And end up in your infection
Chew your meat for you
Pass it back and forth
in a passionate kiss
From my mouth to yours because
Sloppy lips to lips
You're my vitamins because I'm like you 
Truth covered in security
I can't let you smother me
I'd like to but it wouldn't work
Trading off and taking turns
I don't regret a thing
And I've got this friend, you see  Who makes me feel
and I  Wanted more  than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to prove I still
Smell her on you
Don't tell me what I wanna hear
Afraid of never knowing fear
Experience anything you need
I'll keep fighting jealousy
Until it's fucking gone
And I've got this friend, you see  Who makes me feel
and I  Wanted more  than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to prove I still
Smell her on you
Truth covered in security
I can't let you smother me
I'd like to but it wouldn't work
Trading off and taking turns
I don't regret a thing
And I've got this friend, you see  Who makes me feel
and I  Wanted more  than I could steal
I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield
I'll go out of my way to make you a deal
We've make a pact to learn from who
Ever every want without new rules
We'll share what's lost and what we grew
They'll go out of their way  To prove they still
Smell her on you
They still
Smell her on you
Smell her on you
Stay
Stay
I don't why (x2)
Stay
Stay
I don't know why (x2) 
Stay
Stay away (x5)
I'll start this off
Without any words
I got so high that
I scratched 'til I bled
Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?
The finest day
That I ever had
Was when I learned
To cry on command
Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
My mother died
Every night
It's safe to say
Don't quote me on that
Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?
The black sheep got
Blackmailed again
Forgot to put
On the zip code
Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream my memory has stored
As defence I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?
It is now time
To make it unclear
To write off lines
That don't make a sense
Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?
One more special
Message to go
And then I'm done
And I can go home
Love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
Underneath the bridge
The tarp has sprung a leak
And the animals i´ve trapped
Have All become my pets
And Im living off grass
And the drippings from the ceiling
its O.K. eat fish
Cause they don't have any feelings
Something in the way
Mmmm......

it's hard to take courage in world full of people
you can lose sight of it all when the darkness inside you
makes you feel so small.
But I see your true colours shining through.
I see your true colours that's why I love you
so don't be afraid to let them show
Your true   colours, true   colours
Are beautiful, ooh like a rain-bow.
Show me your smile   don't be unhappy can't remember when
I last saw you laughing, and this world makes you crazy
and you've taken all you can baby, just call me up
cause you know I'll be there.
But I see your true colours shining through.
I see your true colours that's why I love you
so don't be afraid to let them show
Your true   colours, true   colours,

So sad eyes, take courage now, realise,
when this world makes you crazy

About one year ago and you wanted to know,

I need help and you're way across the sea
I could never touch you - I think it would be wrong
Oh - I've got your letter
you've got my song
They don't make stationery like this
where I'm from - so fragile,
so refined
So I sniff and I lick
your envelope and fall to little pieces every time
I wonder what clothes you wear to school
I wonder how you decorate your room
I wonder how you touch yourself
and curse myself for being across the sea
Why are you so far away from me?
I need help and you're way across the sea
I could never touch you - I think it would be wrong

I thought the older women would like me if i did
You see mom, I'm a good little boy (good little boy)
It's all your fault, momma.
It's all your fault
Goddamn, this business is really lame
I gotta live on an island to find the juice
So you send me your love
from all around the world
As if I could live on words and dreams and a million screams
oh, how I need a hand in mine to feel.

 non sia stato inutile
 stare insieme a te
 Ok te ne vai
 decisione discutibile
 ma si lo so lo sai.
 Almeno resta qui per questa sera 
 ma no che non ci provo stai sicura
 puo' darsi gia' mi senta troppo solo
 perche' conosco quel sorriso
 di chi gia' deciso
 quel sorriso gia' una volta
 mi ha aperto il Paradiso
 Si dice che per ogni uomo
 c'e' un'altra come te
 e al posto mio quindi
 tu troverai qualcun altro
 uguale non non credo io
 ma questa volta abbassi gli occhi e dici
 noi resteremo sempre buoni amici
 ma quali buoni amici maledetti
 io un amico lo perdono
 mentre a te ti amo
 puo' sembrarti anche banale,
 ma e' un istinto naturale
 E C'E' una cosa
 i miei problemi senza te
 ed e' per questo
 che mi vedi fare il duro
 in mezzo al mondo
 per sentirmi piu' sicuro.
 E se davvero non vuoi dirmi
 ricorda a volte un uomo
 e invece tu,
 tu non mi lasci via d'uscita
 e te ne vai con la mia storia tra le dita.
 Ora che fai
 cerchi una scusa,
 se vuoi andare vai
 tanto di me
 non ti devi preoccupare,
 me la sapro' cavare
 Stasera scrivero' una canzone
 per soffocare dentro un'emozione
 Senza pensare troppo alle parole
 parlero' di quel sorriso
 di chi ha gia' deciso
 quel sorriso che una volta
 mi ha aperto il paradiso
 E C'E' una cosa
 i miei problemi senza te
 ed e' per questo

Can't remember, what went wrong last September

Life of the party and she swears that she's artsy
But you could distinguish Miles from Coltrane

She thinks I can't see the smile that she's faking

Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair

I've seen this room and I've walked this floor (you know)

And love is not a victory march

And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you

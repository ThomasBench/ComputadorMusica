you wouldn't even know  a diamond  if  you held  it  in your  hand
                Your ever lastin' summer, you can see it fadin' fast,
                So you grab a piece of somethin' that you think is gonna last.
        Well, you wouldn't even know a diamond if you held it in your hand;
                The things you think are precious I can't understand.
       [Chorus] Are you reelin' in the years, stowin away the time?
          |     Are you gatherin' up the tears, have you had enough of mine
          |     Are you reelin' in the years, stowin away the time?
          |     Are you gatherin' up the tears, have you had enough of mine
          |     Are you reelin' in the years, stowin away the time?
          |     Are you gatherin' up the tears, have you had enough of mine
          |     Are you reelin' in the years, stowin away the time?
          _     Are you gatherin' up the tears, have you had enough of mine
                You been tellin' me you're a genius since you were seventeen;
                In all the time I've known you I still don't know what you mean.
                The weekend at the college didn't turn out like you planned;
                The things that pass for knowledge I can't understand.
       [Chorus] Are you reelin' in the years, stowin away the time?
          |     Are you gatherin' up the tears, have you had enough of mine
          |     Are you reelin' in the years, stowin away the time?
          _     Are you gatherin' up the tears, have you had enough of mine
                I've spent a lit of money and I spent a lot of time;
                The trip we made to Hollywood is etched upon my mind.
                After all the things we've done and seen you find another man;
                The things you think are useless I can't understand.
       [Chorus] Are you reelin' in the years, stowin away the time?
          |     Are you gatherin' up the tears, have you had enough of mine
          |     Are you reelin' in the years, stowin away the time?

The earth, a purple blaze
Of sapphire haze in orbit always
While down below the trees
Bathed in cool breeze, silver starlight
Breaks dawn from night
And so, we pass on by
The crimson eye of great God Mars
As we travel the universe

It can all but break your heart in pieces

as well be someday

Wrestling with your desires; frozen stangers stealing your fires

Only words that   I              could    find

Voice of confusion inside of me, begging to go back where I'm free
Feels like I'm through,

Hung velvet overtaken me
To a song dissolved in the dawn
The music hall a costly bow
To a muted trumperter swan

Strike the street quicksilver moon
   Carriage across the fog
Two-Step to lamp lights cellar tune
The laughs come hard in Auld Lang Syne
The glass was raised, the fired rose
The fullness of the wine, the dim last toast- ing
While at port adieu or die
A choke of grief heart hardened I
Beyond belief a broken man too tough to cry
   Surf's Up
   Aboard a tidal wave
   Come about hard and join
The young and often spring you gave
I heard the word
Wonderful thing

Am I still too young""

All night-she want s the young American
Young American, young American
It's all right-but she wants the young American
Scanning life thru the picture window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang
Heaven forbid she'll take anything
But the freak and his type-all for nothing
Misses a step and cuts his hand
Showing nothing he swoops like a song
She cries ""where have all papa's heroes gone?""
All night-she want s the young American
Young American, young American
It's all right-but she wants the young American

He breadwinner begs of the bathroom floor
""Live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?""

Young American, young American
It's all right-but she wants the young American
Do you remember your President Nixon?
So you remember the bills you have to pay
or even yesterday?
Have you been the un-American
Just you and your id singing falsetto 'bout
leather, leather everywhere and
not a myth left from the Ghetto
Well, well, well would you carry a razor?
In case, just in case of depression
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the afro-sheeners
Ain't that close to love?
Ein't that poster love?
Well it ain't that brbie doll
Her hearts have been broken just like you
All night-you want  the young American
Young American, young American
It's all right-you want the young American
You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
Pimps got a Caddy-lady got a Chrysler
Black's got respect-white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps and look at your hands hey
""I heard the news today, oh boy""
I got-suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man-who could say no more
Ain't there a woman-I can sock on the jaw
Ain't there a child-I can hold without judging
Ain't there a pen-that will write before they die
Ain't you proud-that you've still got faces
and ain't there one damn song  that can make me
All night-you want  the young American
Young American, young American
It's all right-you want the young American

Gee my life's a funny thing
Am I still too young

Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers and
Ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go, and everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie

The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks(The Jean Genie)
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go
Sits like a man, but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him, but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie

The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks(The Jean Genie)
He's outrageous, he screams and he bawls

Some are silk and some are leather

I was such a great romancer
Then I came home to a woman
That I could not recognize
When I pressed her for a reason
She refused to even answer
It was then I felt the stranger
Kick me right between the eyes

 I'm sick to death of seeing things
From tight-lipped, condescending, mamas little chauvinists
 All I want is the truth
 Just gimme some truth now
 I've had enough of watching scenes
Of schizophrenic, ego-centric, paranoiac, prima-donnas
 All I want is the truth
Just gimme some truth
No short-haired, yellow-bellied, son of tricky dicky’s gonna
Mother hubbard soft soap me
With just a pocketful of soap
Money for dope
Money for rope
 I'm sick to death of hearing things
From uptight, short-sighted, narrow-minded hypocritics
 All I want is the truth
 Just gimme some truth
 I’ve had enough of reading things
By neurotic, psychotic, pig-headed politicians
 All I want is the truth
 Just gimme some truth
 All I want is the truth
 Just gimme some truth
 All I want is the truth
 Just gimme some truth

Oh my love

 Oooooooh                            [How do you sleep?]
How do you sleep at night?
 You live with straights who tell you you was king
 Jump when your momma tell you anything
 The only thing you done was yesterday
 And since you're gone you're just a-nother day
 Oooooooh                               [How do you sleep?]

 A pretty face may last a year or two
 But pretty soon they'll see what you can do
 The sound you make is muzak to my ears

I left my heart to the sappers round, Khe Sahn.
And my soul was sold with my cigarettes, to the black market man.
I've had the Vietnam cold turkey, from the ocean to the silver city
And it's only other vets could understand.
'Bout the long forgotten dockside guarantees,
How there were no V-day heroes in nineteen seventy-three;
How we sailed into Sydney Harbour, saw an old friend but I couldn't kiss her.
She was lined, and I was home to the lucky land
She was like so many more from that time on
Their lives were all so empty, till they'd found their chosen one,
And their legs were often open, but their minds were always closed,
And their hearts were held in fast suburban chains
And the legal pads were yellow, hours long paypackets lean,
And the telex writers clattered where the gunships once had been;
But the carparks made me jumpy, and I never stopped the dreams,
Or the growing need for speed and novacaine
So I worked across the country from end to end
Tried to find a place to settle down, where my mixed up life could mend,
Held a job on an oil-rig, flying choppers when I could,
But the nightlife nearly drove me round the bend.
And I've travelled round the world from year to year,
And each one found me aimless, one more year the worse for wear,
And I've been back to South East Asia, and the answer sure ain't there,
But I'm drifting north, to check things out again.
Well the last plane of Sydney's almost gone.
And only seven flying hours, and I'll be landing in Hong Kong.
And there ain't nothin' like the kisses from a jaded Chinese princess,
I'm gonna hit some Hong Kong mattress all night long
Well the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone.
You know the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone.
And it's really got me worried, I'm going nowhere and I'm in a hurry.
You know the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone.

doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door.
doesn't help to know that you're just time away.
Long ago I reached for you and there you stood.
Holding you again could only do me good.
         Oh, how I wish I could 
         but you're so far away.
One more song about moving along the highway
can't say much of anything that's new.
If I could only work my life out my way
I'd rather spend it being close to you 
        but you're so far away
Doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore?
It would be so fine to see your face at my door.
doesn't help to know that you're just time away
Traveling around sure gets me down and lonely
nothin' else to do but close my mind.
I sure don't hope the road don't come to own me
There's so many dreams I've yet to find
       but you're so far away
doesn't anybody stay in one place anymore
it would be so fine to see your face at my door
doesn't help to know that you're so far away

Travelling twice the speed of sound,

When the shows were over,
we had to get back home
And when we opened up the door,
I had to be alone.
She helped me with my suitcase,
she stands before my eyes
Driving me to the airport,
and to the friendly skies.
Going through security,
I held her for so long.
She finally looked at me in love,
and she was gone.
Just a song before I go,
a lesson to be learned.

it's easy to get burned.

clicked his heels and stepped

     And after 20 years he still grieves 
He said I dance now at every chance in honky tonks
  for drinks and tips
But most the time I spend behind these county bars

Where the needle’s eye is winking, closing in on the poor.

We’ve got to get in to get out
We’ve got to get in to get out
We’ve got to get in to get out.
There’s only one direction in the faces that I see;
It’s upward to the ceiling, where the chamber’s said to be.

They are pulled up by the magnet, believing they’re free.

We’ve got to get in to get out

And the wise and foolish virgins giggle with their bodies glowing bright.

It’s the bottom of a staircase that spirals out of sight.

It's gonna take a lotta love       to get us through the night
It's gonna take a lotta love       to make this work out right
So if you are out there waiting,
I hope you show up soon
You know I need relatin', not solitude   
 Got a lotta love
 Got a lotta lo-ov-ove
It's gonna take a lotta love       to change the way things are
It's gonna take a lotta love       or we won't get to far.
It's gonna take a lotta love      
It's gonna take a lotta love      
It's gonna take a lotta love

it knows I'm leaving you today

when I'll go on my way

so hold me in your dreams til I
come back to you
see the stars in the skies above
they'll shine wherever I may roam
I will pray every lonely night
that soon they'll guide me home

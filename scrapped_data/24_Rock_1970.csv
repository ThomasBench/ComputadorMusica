I guess I'll take my time
Oh yeah, to reach there
Look up at the mountain
 I have to climb
Oh yeah, to reach there.
Lord my body has been a good friend
But I won't need it when I reach the end
Miles from nowhere
Guess I'll take my time
Oh yeah, to reach there
I creep through the valleys
 And I grope through the woods
 cause I know when I find you, my honey
 It's gonna make me feel good
I love everything
 So don't it make you feel sad
 cause I'll drink to you, my baby
 I'll drink to that, I'll drink to that.
Miles from nowhere
Not a soul in sight
Oh yeah, but it's alright
I have my freedom
I can make my own rules
Oh yeah, the ones that I choose
Lord my body has been a good friend
But I won't need it when I reach the end
I love everything
 So don't you make me feel sad
 Cause I'll drink to you my baby

Searchin for soda bottles to get myself some dough
Brung em down to the corner, down to the country store
Cash em in and give my money to a man named Curtis Lowe
Ol' Curt was a black man with white curly hair
When he had a fifth of wine he did not have a care
He used to own an old dobro used to play it 'cross his knee
I'd give Ol' Curt my money, he'd play all day for me
Play me a song, Curtis Lowe, hey Curtis Lowe
I got your drinkin' money, tune up your dobro
People said you was useless but them people all were fools
Cause Curtis Lowe was the finest picker to ever play the blues
He looked to be 60, maybe I was 10
Mama used to whoop me but I'd go see him again
I'd clap my hands, stomp my feets tryin' to stay in time
He'd play me song or two then take another drink of wine
On the day Ol' Curtis died nobody came to pray
Old preacher said some words and they chucked him in the clay
He lived a lifetime playin' the black man's blues
And on the day he lost his life that's all he had to lose
Play me a song Curtis Lowe, hey Curtis Lowe

She said ""I've lost control""
 She's lost control again
  She's lost control
 She's lost control again
  She's lost control
(Riff 1) x2
And I had to phone her friend to state my case
And say ""She's lost control again""
And she showed up all the errors and mistakes
And said ""I've lost control again""
And she expressed herself in many different ways
Until she lost control again
And walked upon the edge of no escape
And laughed ""I've lost control""
 She's lost control again
  She's lost control
 She's lost control again
  She's lost control
I could live a little better with the myths and the lies
When the darkness broke in, I just broke down and cried
                   I could live    
a little in a wider line when the change is gone,
  When the urge is gone
            to lose control...
                When the urge is gone

Ride me high this morning, ride me high some more

If you leave tomorrow, one thing that's for sure

And the road has been too long

In the spring

 Find a place nearby for her to stay
 Just someone to keep my house clean -
 Fix my meals and go away.

 A maid     
 It's hard to make that change
 When life and love turn strange and   cold    
 To give a love,  you gotta live a love.  
 To live a love,  you gotta be part of. 
 When will I see you again?

 I fell in love with the actress.

With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue,
the only thing I ever got from you was sorrow, sorrow.
Aaah, aah, aaah!

  Sounds like good advice but there's no one at my side
And time washes clean love's wounds unseen
 That's what someone told me but I don't know what it means.
 Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you for a long long time
B|---------------|
Caught in my fears Blinking back the tears
   I can't say you hurt me when you never let me near
And I never drew one response from you
  All the while you fell all over girls you never knew
 Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine
And I think it's gonna hurt me for a long long time
B|---------------|
  Wait for the day You'll go away
  Knowing that you warned me of the price I'd have to pay
And life's full of flaws Who knows the cause?
  Living in the memory of a love that never was
 Cause I've done everything I know to try and change your mind
And I think I'm gonna miss you for a long long time
 Cause I've done everything I know to try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you for a long long time

               And every time i thought i'd got it made
                  It seems the taste was not so sweet,
                    So i turned my self to face me
                    But I've never caught a glimpse
                 Of how the others must see the fa- ker

                   And so the days flow thru my eyes
                   But still the days still seem the same.
                     And these children that you spit on
                   As they try to change their worlds,
                   Are immune to your consulta -tions.

  Above us only    sky.
 Imagine all the people
Living for to -  day. A-hah.
  Imagine there's no      countries.
  It isn't hard to     do.
  Nothing to kill or      die for
  And no religion     too. 
 Imagine all the people
Living life in    peace. huh-ugh.
  You may say I'm a dreamer
  But I'm not the only one
 I hope some day you'll join us
  And the world will be as one
   Imagine no pos     sessions
  I wonder if you   can
 No need for greed or hunger
 A brotherhood of      man
 Imagine all the people
Sharing all the   world - huh
  You may say I'm a dreamer
  But I'm not the only one
 I hope some day you'll join us
  And the world will be as one

Blind in the light of the interstate cars
Passing me by, the busses and semi's,
Plunging like stones from a slingshot on mars
But I'm here by the road, bound to the load
That I picked up in ten thousand cafes and bars
Alone with the rush of the drivers who won't pick me up
The highway, the moon, the clouds, and the stars
Black throated wind, keeps on pouring in
With its words of a life where nothing is new
Ah, mother american night, I'm lost from the light
Oh, I'm drowning in you
I left St. Louis, city of blues, in the midst of a storm I'd rather forget
I tried to pretend it came to an end
Cause you weren't the woman I once thought I'd met
But I can't deny, that times have gone by Bm        
Where I never had doubts or thoughts of regret
And I was a man when all this began
Who wouldn't think twice about being there yet
Black throated wind, keeps on pouring in
And it speaks of a life that passes like dew
It's forced me to see that you've done better by me
Better by me than I've done by you
Now what's to be found racing around.
You carry your pain wherever you go
All full of the blues and trying to lose
You ain't gonna learn what you don't wanna know
So I give you my eyes, and all of their lies
Please help them to learn as well as to see
Capture a glance, and make it dance
Of looking at you, looking at me
Black throated wind, keeps on pouring in
With its words of a lie that could almost be true
Ah, mother american night, here comes the light
I'm turning around, that's what I'm gonna do
Going back home that's what I'm gonna do
You're bringing me down, I'm running around,
Blind in the lights of the interstate cars,
Passing me by, the buses and semis,
Plunging like stones from a slingshot on Mars.
But I'm here by the road, bound to the load,
I picked up in ten thousand cafes and bars.
Alone with the rush of the drivers that won't pick me up,
The highway, the moon and the clouds and the stars.
Black throated wind, keeps on pourin' in,
With its words of a life where nothing is new,
Ah, mother American night, I pass from the light,
Ah, I'm drowning in you.

I was layin' in my bed and dyin'.
Annie Bonneau from St. Angel say the weather down here so fine.
See here how everything lead up to this day,
And it's just like any other day that's ever been.
Sun comin' up and then the sun goin' down.
Shine through my window and my friends they come around,
Come around, come around.

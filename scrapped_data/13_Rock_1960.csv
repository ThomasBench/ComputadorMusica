This is the way
I always dreamed it would be
The way that it is, oh oh
When you are holding me
I never had a love of my own
Maybe that's why when we're all alone
I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city baby
Seems to disappear
I can hear music
Sweet, sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
When ever you're near
Lovin' you
It keeps me satisfied
And I can't explain, oh no
The way that I feel inside
You look at me we kiss and then
I close my eyes and here it comes again
I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city baby
Seems to disappear
I can hear music
Sweet, sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
When ever you're near
I hear the music all the time, yeah
I hear the music. Hold me tight now, baby
I hear the music all the time
I hear the music
I hear the music, baby
I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city baby
Seems to disappear
I can hear music
Sweet, sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby

She said she would always stay.
But I was cruel,  I treated her like a fool,
I threw it all away.
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand,
And rivers that ran through ev'ry day.
I must have been mad, I never knew what I had,
Until I threw it all away.
Love is all there is,
It makes the world go 'round,
Love and only love, it can't be denied.
No matter what you think about it,
You just won't be able to do without it.
Take a tip from one who's tried.
So if you find someone that gives you all of her love.
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
For one thing that's certain, you will surely be a-hurtin'
If you throw it all away.
If you throw it all away.

   Straight down the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico.
To Lake Charles, Louisianna, little Bessie, a girl who I once knew.
  She told me just to come on by if there's anything that she could do.
Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me.
If I spring a leak, she mends me.
I don't have to speak, she defends me.
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one.
Good luck had just stung me, to the race track I did go.
  She bet on one horse to win and I bet on another to show.
The odds were in my favor, I had them five to one.
  That nag to win came around the track, sure enough she had won.
Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me.
If I spring a leak, she mends me.
I don't have to speak, she defends me.
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one.
I took up all of my winnings and I gave little Bessie half.
   She tore it up and threw it in my face just for a laugh.
And there's one thing in the whole wide world I sure would like to see.
  that's when that little love of mine dips her doughnut in my tea.
Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me.
If I spring a leak, she mends me.
I don't have to speak, she defends me.
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one.
Me and my mate we were back at the shack, we had Spike Jones on the box.
  She says, ""I can't take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk.""
Now that just gave my heart a throb to the bottom of my feet.
 And I swore as I took another pull, my Bessie can't be beat.
Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me.
If I spring a leak, she mends me.
I don't have to speak, she defends me.
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one.
There's a flood out in California and up north it's freezing cold.
  And this living on the road is getting pretty old.
So I guess I'll call up my big mama, tell her I'll be rolling in.
But you know, deep down, I'm kind of tempted
To go and see my Bessie again.
Up on Cripple Creek, she sends me.
If I spring a leak, she mends me.
I don't have to speak, she defends me.
A drunkard's dream if I ever did see one.

All that false instruction

Which goes from bad to worse?

And scratched your name in sand

Than a place for you to stand

You discovered no one would be true

It was just a childish thing to do

Like the last of the good old choo-choo trains
I'm the last of the blood and sweat brigade
And I gonna keep on going (going)...till my dying day
I'm the last of the good old fashioned steam...powered trains
I'm the last of the good old puffer trains
I'm the last of the soot and scum brigade
And all this peaceful living (living).... drives me insane
I'm the last of the good old fashioned steam...powered trains
I'm the last of the good old fashioned steam........powered trains
Big Sky looked down on all the people looking up at The Big Sky
Everybody's pushing one another around
Big Sky feels sad when he sees the children scream and cry
But Big Sky's too big to let it get him down
Big Sky's too big to cry
Big Sky's too high to see
People like you and me
One day we'll be free
We won't care just you see
Till that day can be don't let it get you down
And when I see that the world's too much for me
I think of The Big Sky and nothing matters much to me
Big Sky looked down on all the people who think they've got problems
Big Sky's too occupied
One day we'll be free
Till that day can be don't let it get you down
Just sitting down by the riverside,
Spreading my arms to the open wide.
Now I am free and the world's at my feet
I can close my eyes.
Oh love, keep me warm, keep me satisfied.
Please keep me calm, keep me pacified.
Now I'm content and my life is complete.
I can close my eyes.       (enter psychadelia a la ""day in a life"")
Sitting by the riverside with you.
I love sitting down by the riverside,
Watching the water go flowing by.
Oh, golly-gee, it is heaven to be
Like a willow tree.
Spend my time just drinking wine while looking at the view.
This world is big and wild and half insane
Take me where real animals are playing
Just a dirty old shack, where the hound dogs bark
That we called our home, I wanna be back there
Among the cats and dogs and the pigs and the goats
On animal farm    my animal home
On animal farm    my animal home
Girl it's a hard hard world if it gets you down
Dreams often fade and die in a bad bad world
On animal farm
Animal farm
Out in the country
Far from all the soot and noise of the city
There's a village green
It's been a long time
Since I last set eyes on the church with the steeple
Down by the village green
 Ah la la la la
'Twas there I met a girl call Daisy
And kissed her by the old oak tree
 Ah la la la la
Although I loved my Daisy, I sought fame
And so I left the village green
I miss the village green, And all the simple people
I miss the village green, The church, the clock, the steeple
I miss the morning dew, fresh air and Sunday school
La la la la la
We will laugh and talk about the village green
Baby, you don't know what you're saying
Because you're a victim of pride's city  lights
And your mind is not right
You think the world's at your feet
You're starstruck baby starstruck
Starstruck baby starstruck
You know that you're starstruck on me
A long, long time ago, in a land of idiot boys
There lived the cat, a phenomenal cat
Who loved to wallow all day
Though he was big and fat, all the world was good to him
And he pointed out on the map all the places he had been
Cowes, Sardinia, Katmandu, The Scilly Isles and Sahara, too
My big day, it was the biggest day of my life
It was the summit of my long career
But I felt so down, and I drank too much beer
And my manager said that I should not appear
All of my friends were there
Not just my friends, but their best friends too
All of my friends were there to stand and stare
Say what they may, all of their friends need not stare
Those who laughed were not friends anyway
All of my friends were there to stand and stare
E|--4-4-4-4-6-6-7--|  (repeat)
In a dark and misty house
Where no Christian man has been
Wicked Annabella mixes a brew
That no one's ever seen
I, I've seen her hair, I've seen her face
I, I've felt her eyes burning my soul
Twisting my mind
                     Ja ja, ja ja ja    ja ja, ja ja ja...
Under a lamp light, Monica stands at midnight
And every guy think he can buy her love
But money can't buy sweet lovin' from Monica
I, I shall die, I, I shall die if I should lose Monica (Oh Monica my love)
People can try, People can try, but they can't buy Monica, my love
Monica
People take pictures of the summer
Just in case someone thought they had missed it
And to prove that it really existed
You can't picture love that you took from me
When we were young and the world was free
Pictures of things as they used to be, don't show me no more please
Nie na nie na   Nie na nie na
Nie na nie na   Nie nie nie na
Nie na nie na   nie na nie na
Nie na nie na   nie nie nie na
nie na nie na   nie na nie na
A picture of me when I was just three
Sat with my ma by the old oak tree
How I love things as they used to be, don't show me no more please

I'm going back some day, come what may, to blue bayou
Where you sleep all day, and the catfish play, on blue bayou
All those fishing boats, with their sails afloat, if I could only see
That familiar sunrise, through sleepy eyes, how happy I'd be
Go to see my baby again,
and to be with some of my friends
Maybe I'd be happy then, on blue bayou
I'm going back some day, gonna stay, on blue bayou
Where the folks are fine, and the world is mine, on blue bayou

Oh, some sweet day, gonna take away, this hurting inside

 I want to play with my ding a ling

 catched me playin' with my ding a ling

Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
And everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh
  In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Answer the phone,
""Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kinda pills are you on?""
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh
  In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America, two kids, follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first
(Hey!)
As it was
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was

I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true, mmm
Give me a day or two
To think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do,  mm-mm
  Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable, ooh
So if you really wanna know
When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (I'm happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mmm
You called me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut them all out for you 'cause I was a kid
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone

Stuck in our ways

now that I'm gone

Trying to find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared

And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears

Was I reckless to help?

Than being good to their own child
He wore long sleeves cuz of his dad

Hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush

She raised her brothers on her own
Her parents hated who she loved
She couldn't wait to go to college
She was tired cuz she was brought
Into a world where family was merely blood
Does she know how proud I am she was created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred
We don't talk much but I just gotta say
""I miss you,     and I hope that you're okay""
Address the letters, to the holes in my butterfly wings
Nothing's forever, nothing's as good as it seems
And when the clouds won't iron out
And the monsters creep into your house
And every door is hard to close
Well I hope you know how proud I am you were created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred
God, I hope that you're happier today

'Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress, I hate to think that I was just your type
I bet that she knows Billy Joel 'cause you played her Uptown Girl
You're singin' it together, now I bet you even tell her
How you love her in between the chorus and the verse (I love you)
So when you gonna tell her that we did that too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all re-used
That was the show we talked about, played you the songs she's singin' now
When she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu, oh   
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu, don't act like we didn't do that shit too
You're trading jackets like we used to do (yeah everything is all re-used)
Play her piano but she doesn't know that I was the one who taught you Billy Joel
A different girl now but there's nothing new (I know you get déjà vu)

Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are

Last week, I realized I crave pity
When I re-tell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest
I was still bein' ignored (Lyin' for attention, just to get neglection)
Now we're estranged
 Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for
Someday, I'll be bored of

That we care so much, until we don't
I'm gettin' older, I've got more on my shoulders
But I'm gettin' better at admitting when I'm wrong

To keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure

Would depend on what I'm given (Not on his permission)

Getting good at saying, ""gotta bounce""
Honestly you always let me down
  19 but you act 25 now
  Knees weak, but you talk pretty proud, wow
  Ripped jeans and a cup that you just downed
  Take me where the music ain't too loud
  Trade drinks, but you don't even know her
  Save me 'till the party is over
  Kiss me in the seat of your Rover
  Real sweet, but I wish you were sober

Fighting my anxiety constantly I try to control it
Even when I know it’s been forever I can still feel the spin
Hurts when I remember and I never wanna feel it again
Don’t know if you get it cause I can’t express how thankful I am
That you were always with me when it hurts I know that you understand
I don’t wanna lose        control
Nothing I can do         anymore
Trying every day when I hold my breath
Spinning out in space pressing on my chest
I don’t wanna lose      control
Sometimes I still think it’s coming but I know it’s not
Trying to breathe in and then out but the air gets caught
Cause even though I’m older now and I know how to shake off the past
I wouldn’t have made it if I didn’t have you holding my hand
I don’t wanna lose        control
Nothing I can do         anymore
Trying every day when I hold my breath
Spinning out in space pressing on my chest

I'm gettin' older, I think I'm agin' well
I wish someone had told me I'd be doin' this by myself
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for
But it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door
Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more
Than anyone before (Anyone before)
  Too bad they're usually deranged
Last week, I realized I crave pity
When I re-tell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest
I was still bein' ignored (Lyin' for attention, just to get neglection)
Now we're estranged
 Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much, until we don't
I'm gettin' older, I've got more on my shoulders
But I'm gettin' better at admitting when I'm wrong
I'm happier than ever, at least, that's my endeavor
To keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure
'Cause to be honest, I just wished the word I promised
Would depend on what I'm givin' (Not on his permission)
(Wasn't my decision) To be abused, mm
 Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for
Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weird
That we care so much, until we don't
But next week, I hope I'm somewhere laughin'
For anybody asking, I promise I'll be fine
I've had some trauma, did things I didn't wanna
Was too afraid to tell ya, but now, I think it's time
    Okay
 Mm-mm, I
I didn't change my number
I only changed who I reply to
Laura said I should be nicer
But not to you
I love a ""You mad at me?"" text
Should have guessed
That you would think I was upset (Haha)
You're obsessed
Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean
I didn't change my number
I only changed who I believe in
You were easy on the eyes, eyes, eyes (Eyes, еyes)
But looks can be decеivin'
I gotta work, I go to work
You don't deserve to feel so hurt
You gotta a lot of fuckin' nerve
I don't deserve, so
Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean
And take it out on you
And your best friend too
I should have left when Drew
Said you were bad news

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

I feel more and more likе I was made for you
     For you
I'm sitting in my brother's room
  Haven't slеpt in a week, or two, or two
I think I might have fallen in love
What am I to do?
Do you know me?
Really know me?
You have opinions about my opinions
About my music
About my clothes
Some people hate what I wear
Some people use it to shame others
But I feel you watching
And nothing I do goes unseen
So while I feel your stares, your disapproval or your sigh of relief
Would you like me to be smaller, weaker, softer, taller?
Would you like me to be quiet?
Am I my stomach? My hips?
Is it not what you wanted?
If I wear what is comfortable, I am not a woman
If I shed the layers, I'm a slut
Though you've never seen my body, you still judge it
Why?
We decide who they are
If I wear more, if I wear less
Is my value based only on your perception?
I don't really even know how it happened
I don't really even know how it happened
I don't really (I don't really) how it happened
I started walkin' (I don't really), gave no reaction
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
I'm overheated, can't bе defeated
I'm overheated
I'm overheated
I don't really wanna know why you went there (Why you went there)
Stop bein' flirty (He-he-he)
Did you really think this is the right thing to do?
That I really looked just like the rest of you
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
I'm overheated, can't bе defeated
I'm overheated
And everybody said it was a let down
'Cause I'm not about to redesign myself now, am I?
All these other inanimate bitches
Posin' for pictures with that plastic body?
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
I'm overheated, can't bе defeated
I'm overheated
I'm overheated
Everybody dies, surprise, surprise
We tell each other lies, sometimes, we try
To make it feel like we might be right
We might not be alone
Be alone
""Everybody dies,"" that's what they say
And maybe, in a couple hundred years, they'll find another way
I just wonder why you'd wanna stay
If everybody goes
You'd still be alone
I don't wanna cry, some days I do
But not about you
It's just a lot to think about
The world I'm used to
The one I can't get back, at lеast not for a while
I sure have a knack for seein' lifе more like a child
It's not my fault, it's not so wrong to wonder why
Everybody dies, and when will I?
You oughta know
That even when it's time, you might not wanna go
But it's okay to cry and it's alright to fall
But you are not alone
You are not alone
    Try not to abuse your power
    I know we didn't choose to change
    You might not wanna lose your power
    But havin' it's so strange
She said you were a hero, you played the part
But you ruined her in a year, don't act like it was hard
And you swear you didn't know (didn't know, didn't know)
I wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleeping in your clothes (in your clothes, in your clothes)
But now she's got to get to class
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad when they find out?
If you could take it all back,  would you?
    Try not to abuse your power
    I know we didn't choose to change
    You might not wanna lose your power
    But havin' it's so strange
I thought that I was special
You made me feel like it was my fault you were the devil
Lost your appeal
Does it keep you in control? (in control)
For you to keep her in a cage?
And you swear you didn't know (didn't know)
You said you thought she was your age
How dare you?
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad if it turns out
That they kill your contract?
  Would you?
    Try not to abuse your power
    I know we didn't choose to change
    You might not wanna lose your power
    But power isn't pain
      Hmm
Ooh,  ooh, ha
La-la-la-la-la
Did you think I'd show up in a limousine? (No)
Had to save my money for security
Got a stalker walkin' up and down the street
Says he's Satan and he'd like to meet
I bought a secret house when I was seventeen
Haven't had a party since I got the keys
Had a pretty boy over, but he couldn't stay
On his way out I made him sign an NDA, mm
Yeah, I made him sign an NDA
Once is good enough
'Cause I don't want him having shit to say-ay, ayy, ayy, ayy-ayy
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go,    oh, no
I can crave it, but you don't need to know, oh-oh
Mm, mm-mm, mm
30 Under 30 for another year (Another year)
I can barely go outside, I think I hate it herе (Think I hate it here)
Maybе I should think about a new career
Somewhere in Kaua'i where I can disappear
I been havin' fun (Fun, fun, fun) gettin' older now
Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth
At least I gave him something he can cry about
I thought about my future, but I want it now, oh-oh
Want it now, mm-mm-mm
You can't keep me up
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go,    oh, no
I can crave it, but you don't need to know, oh-oh
Did I take it too far? (Did I take it too far?)
Now I know what you are (Are)
You hit me so hard (It's so hard)
I saw stars
Think I took it too far (Too far)
When I sold you my heart (My heart)
How'd it get so dark? (So dark)
I saw stars (I saw stars)
Stars (Stars)
I'm not your friend or anything
Damn, you think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend or anything
Damn, you think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
What the hell are you talking about
Get my pretty name outta your mouth
We are not the same with or without
'bout me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal
I'm not your friend or anything
Damn, you think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend or anything
Damn, you think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I don't want press to put your name next to mine
Wanna be nice enough
  Articles, articles, articles
(Got a lotta) Interviews, interviews, interviews
I'm not your friend or anything
Damn, you think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend or anything
Damn, you think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name
I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true, mmm
Give me a day or two
To think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable, ooh
So if you really wanna know
When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (I'm happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mmm
You called me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut them all out for you 'cause I was a kid
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone
Home alone, tryin' not to eat
Distract myself with pornography
I hate the way she looks at me
I can't stand the dialogue, she would never be
That satisfied, it's a male fantasy
I'm goin' back to therapy
'Cause I loved you then
And I love you now and I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know
When nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you
(Want me to sing in here?)
I got a call from a girl I used to know
We were inseparable years ago
Thought we'd get along but it wasn't so
And it's all I think about when I'm behind the wheel
I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel
But nothing lasts, I know the deal
'Cause I loved you then
And I love you now and I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know
When nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you
Can't get over you
No matter what I  do
I know I should but I could never hate you

How come we both become a version of a person we don't even like?
We're in love with the world but the world just wants to bring us down
By puttin' ideas in our heads to corrupt our hearts somehow
When I was a child every single thing could blow my mind
Soaking it all up for fun but now I only soak up wine
They say to play hard, you work hard, find balance in the sacrifice
And yet I don't know anybody who's truly satisfied
You better believe I'm trying (Trying, trying)
To keep climbing (Climbing, climbing)
But the higher we climb feels like we're both none the wiser
So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop trying to be somebody else
So we can love each other for free
Everybody wants something, you just want me
Why am I obsessing about the things I can't control?
Why am I seeking approval from people I don't even know?
In these crazy times I hope I can find something I can cling onto

'Cause I want you so bad but you can't fight fire with fire

49,Anyone,Justin Bieber,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/justin-bieber/anyone-chords-3494039,"  Dance with me under the diamonds
  See me like breath in the cold
  Sleep with me here in the silence
  Come kiss me, silver and gold
You say that I won't lose you
But you can't predict the future
So just hold on like you will never let go
Yeah, if you ever move on without me
  I need to make sure you know
That you are the only one I'll ever love
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone
Lookin' back on my life you're the only good I've ever done
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone
  Forever's not enough time to (No)
  Love you the way that I want (Love you the way that I want)
  Cause every morning I find you (No)
  I fear the day that I don't
You say that I won't lose you
But you can't predict the future
'Cause certain things are out of our control
Yeah, if you ever move on without me
  I need to make sure you know
That you are the only one I'll ever love
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone
Lookin' back on my life you're the only good I've ever done
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone
Oh, oh, oh, oh
If it's not you, it's not anyone
Oh, oh, oh yeah, woah
Yeah, you are the only one I'll ever love
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone
Lookin' back on my life you're the only good I've ever done
Yeah, you, if it's not you, it's not anyone

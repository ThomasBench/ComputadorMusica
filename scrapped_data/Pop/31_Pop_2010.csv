0,American Money (ver 2),BØRNS,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/1787152,"I was there when you fell from the clouds
And landed in the desert
There was a thunder inside of my heart
There was a wonderful pleasure
And like a stallion racing the rain
You rode on the back of my bike
I knew from the song that you sang
That you were my lover for life
Ooooh, there's no time to sleep
Ooooh, living in a dream
So take me to the paradise
In your eyes
Green like american money
You taste just right
Sweet like Tennessee honey
And we can run away
Swimming in the sunlight everyday
Oh, Paradise in your eyes
Green like american money
So we took to the calico road
Just running from the weather
There was a highway inside of her eyes
There was a buried treasure
And we got caught in the storm
You started flying a kite
At the end was the key to my heart
You were my lover for life
Ooooh, there's no time to sleep
Ooooh, living in a dream
So take me to the paradise
In your eyes
Green like american money
You taste just right
Sweet like Tennessee honey
And we can run away
Swimming in the sunlight everyday
Oh, Paradise in your eyes
Green like american money
We carved our love in the mountainside
We soaked our hearts in the rain
And I, waited my whole life, for you
So take me to the paradise
In your eyes
Green like american money
You taste just right
Sweet like Tennessee honey
And we can run away
Swimming in the sunlight everyday
Oh, Paradise in your eyes
Green like american money
Ah-ah
Ah-ah

I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me I just melt away
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear.
But I know
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it after fighting through my fears
And finally you put me first
Baby it's you.
You're the one I love.
You're the one I need.
You're the only one I see.
Come on baby it's you.
You're the one that gives your all.
You're the one I can always call.
When I need you Baby everything stops.
Finally you put my love on top.

You put my love on top.
Ooo! Come on Baby.
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top.

I can feel the wind whipping past my face.
As we dance the night away.
Boy your lips taste like a night of champagne.
As I kiss you again, and again, and again and again.

Once again
Feeling lost but now and then
I breathe it in
To let it go
And you don't know where you are now
Or what it would come to
If only somebody could hear
When you figure out how
You're lost in the moment
You disappear
You don't have to be afraid
To put your dream in action
Your never gonna fade
You'll be the main attraction
Not a fantasy
Just remember me
When it turns out right
Cause you know that if you’re living
Your imagination
Tomorrow you'll
Be everybody's fascination
In my victory
Just remember me
When I make it shine
(Shine)
Reaching high
I'm feeling low
I'm holding on but letting go
I'd like to shine
I'll shine for you
And it's time to show the world how
It's a little bit closer
As long as I'm ready to go
All we have is right now
As long as you feel it inside you know
You don't have to be afraid
To put your dream in action
Your never gonna fade
You'll be the main attraction
Not a fantasy
Just remember me
When it turns out right
Cause you know that if you’re living
Your imagination
Tomorrow you'll
Be everybody's fascination
In my victory
Just remember me

it's all said and done
that harder times will change your mind
And make you want to run
But you want it
And you need it
Like you need to breath the air
If they doubt you
Just believe it
That's enough to get you there
You don't have to be afraid
To put your dream in action
Your never gonna fade
You'll be the main attraction
Not a fantasy

And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time
And I never never saw you coming
And I'll never never be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone just you and me
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
So you were never a saint
But this love is brave and wild
And I never never saw you coming
And I'll never never be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real
And I never never saw you coming
And I'll never never be the same
And I never never saw you coming
And I'll never never be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
Lovin' him is like, drivin' a new Maserati
Down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ended so suddenly
Loving him is like, tryin' to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn so bright
Just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue, like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody
You never met
But loving him was red
Re ee ed, re ee ed, re ee ed
Lovin' him was red
Re ee ed, re ee ed, re ee ed
Touching him was like, realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as, easy as knowin' all the words
To your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like tryin' to solve a
Crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
That love could be that strong
Losing him was blue, like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody
You never met
But loving him was red
Re ee ed, re ee ed, oh red, re ee ed
Burnin' red, re ee ed, re ee ed
Re ee ed,
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echos
Tellin' myself it's time now gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my, head
And burning red
Burning was reeeeed
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody
You never met
Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
Oh Burning reeeeeeeed
And that's Why he's spinnin' 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burnin' red
Yeah, yeah
His love was like, drivin' a new Maserati
Down a dead end street.
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus eye to eye
Till the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quick sand
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I I I, like it
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I I I, like it
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will, get you a, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and
I will follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
This hope is treacherous
This day dream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will, get you I'll, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and
I will follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, I'll follow you home
This slope is Treacherous
And I I I, like it
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me-e-e-e-e
I guess you didn't care, and I guess liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without meeeee
And he's long gone, when he's next to me and I
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now-ow
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Till you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now-ow
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground!
Ahh  oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Ahh  oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know, that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning-e-e-e-ing
And I heard you moved on, from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt, is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see-e-e-e-e
He was long gone, when he met me
And I realize, the joke is on me,  yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now-ow
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Till you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now-ow
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground!

Ahh  oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
And the sadest fear, comes creepin' in
That you never loved me or her,
Or anyone, or anything, yeah yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now-ow
Flew me to places I'd never been (never been)
'Till you put me down, oh

Ahh  oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Ahh  oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
trouble, trouble, trouble
I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something about it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you still got it in your drawer even now
Oh your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone
And that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay
But I'm not fine at all
Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me
Wind in my hair I was there I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-size bed
Your mother's telling stories about you on the tee ball team
You tell me about your past thinking your future was me
And I know it's long gone
And there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs I was there I remember it all to well
And maybe we got lost in translation maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared I was there I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Cause I remember it all all all too well
Time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You cant get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well yeah
Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare I was there I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair you were there you remember it all
Down the stairs you were there you remember it all
It was rare I was there I remember it all too well
It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes uh uh uh uh
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers uh uh uh uh
Yeaaaah we're happy free confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical oh yeaaaaaaah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time uh uh
I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
Twenty-twoooooo
Twenty-twoooooo
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids uh uh uh uh
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping
Yeaaaah we're happy free confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical oh yeaaaaaaah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time uh uh
I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
Twenty-twoooooo
Twenty-twoooooo
I don't know about you
Twenty-twoooooo
Twenty-twooooo
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you I gotta have you
I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
Twenty-twoooooo
Twenty-twoooooo
Dancing like
Twenty twooooooo
Twenty twooooooo
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you I gotta have you
I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long ard week
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Everytime I don't
I almost do
I almost do
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
Cause each time you reach out there's no reply
I bet it never ever occurred to you
That I can't say hello to you
And risk another goodbye
 And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Everytime I don't
I almost do
I almost do
We made quite a mess babe
It's probably better off this way
In my dreams you're touching my face
And asking me if I want to try again with you
And I almost do
 And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Everytime I don't
I almost do
I almost do
I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me
I remember when we broke up the first time
saying this is it I've had enough cause like
we haven't seen each other in a month
when you said you needed space what?
Then you come around again and say
baby I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change
Trust me remember how that lasted for a day
I say I hate you we break up you call me I love you
Ooh      we called it off again last night
but ooh     this time I'm telling you I'm telling you
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
but we are never ever ever ever getting back together
      like ever
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
and me falling for it screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
with some indie record that's much cooler than mine
Ooh     you called me up again tonight
But ooh     this time I'm telling you I'm telling you
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
but we are never ever ever ever getting back together
Ooh,    ooh,
ooh,    oh
I used to think that we were forever ever
and I used to say never say never
Ugh so he calls me up and he's like 'I still love you and I'm like 'I'm just sick of it I mean
this is exhausting you know like, we are never getting back together like ever
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
but we are never ever ever ever getting back together
We (ooh ooh) getting back together
We (ooh ooh) oh, getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
but we are never ever ever ever getting back together
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But yoooooooooouuuuuuuu stayed
This morning I said we should talk about it
Cause I read you should never leave a file unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said okay let's talk
And I said
Stay stay stay
I've been loving you for quite some
Time time time
You think that it's funny when I'm
Mad mad mad
But I think that it's best if we both
Stay
Before you I only dated self indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carrying my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to
Stay stay stay
I've been loving you for quite some
Time time time
You think that it's funny when I'm
Mad mad mad
But I think that it's best if we both
Stay  stay  stay  stay
You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out with you all the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occuring to me
I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life
Stay
And I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get
Mad mad mad
So I think that it's best if we both
Stay  stay  stay  stay
Stay stay stay
I've been loving you for quite some
Time time time
You think that it's funny when I'm
Mad mad mad
But I think that it's best if we both
Stay  stay  stay  stay
Stay stay stay
I've been loving you for quite some
Time time time
You think that it's funny when I'm
Mad mad mad
But I think that it's best if we both
Stay
Found myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I'm not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better
Right before your eyes
I'm breaking and fast
No reasons why
Just you and me
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name on the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better
When right before your eyes
I'm aching run fast
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name on the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
This is the last time I say it's been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time I won't hurt you anymore
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name on the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name on the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Time I'm asking you this
Time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Time I'm asking you this
Time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Time I'm asking you this
Time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Time I'm asking you this
Time I'm asking you this
I was reminiscing just the other day
Back to a first glance feeling on New York time
Took off faster than a green light, go
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day
Was holy ground
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We block the noise with the sound of ""I need you""
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd
'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Tonight I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't want to dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't want to dance
If I'm not dancing with you
It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Tonight I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't want to dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't want to dance
Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait
We had, a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love a---ffair
In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, different cities
And time is taking it's sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons and darling they all look like me
Cause we had, a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love a---ffair
Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen
Hang up, give up, and for the life, of us we can't get back
A beautiful, magic, love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic, beautiful
What we had, a beautiful, magic, love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love a---ffair
We had, a beautiful, magic, love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love a----ffair
New to town with a made up name
In the angel's city chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a 60s queen
Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the skyyyy
And They'll tell You now
You're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now
You're the lucky one
But can you tell me now
You're the lucky one
oh, oh, oh...
Now It's big black cars and riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn'T even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky but you're so confused
Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place
Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive
And they'll tell you now
You're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now
You're the lucky one
But can you tell me now
You're the lucky one
oh, oh, oh...
oh....oh....oh-oh-oh
ohhh..ohhh.oh-oh-ohhh
It was a few years later i showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over madison square
And it took some time, but i understand it now...
Cause now my name is up in lights
But i think you got it right
Let me tell you now
You're the lucky one
Let me tell you now
You're the lucky one
Let me tell you now
You're the lucky one
oh, oh, oh...
Let me tell you now
You're the lucky one
Let me tell you now
You're the lucky one
Let me tell you now
You're the lucky one
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh....
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now, know something now
I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile in
The back of my mind making me feel like
I just want to know you better know, you better know you, better now
I just want to know you better know, you better know, you better now
I just want to know you better know, you better know, you better now
I just want to know you, know you, know you
Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday, is everything has changed
And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
But I'll take them down, take them down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel like
I just want to know you better know, you better know you, better now
I just want to know you better know, you better know, you better now
I just want to know you better know, you better know, you better now
I just want to know you, know you, know you
Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday, is everything has changed
 Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
Ahhh And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind
I just want to know you better know, you better know, you better now
I just want to know you, know you, know you
Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday, is everything has changed
All I know is we said hello
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday, is everything has changed
I said oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight
I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up, late one night at the window
He was 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing
When we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
I said oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
He said, look at you worrying so much about
Things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues
If you keep thinking that way
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?
Like oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Ooh ooh he's talking crazy
Ooh ooh dancing with me
Ooh ooh we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream
Like oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines,
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Don't you see the starlight, starlight
Don't you dream impossible things
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn’t like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn’t get this song but I do, I do
Walked in expecting you’d be late
But you got here early
And you stand and wait
I walk to you
You pulled my chair out and helped me in
And you don’t know how nice that is
But I do
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it’s strange that you think I’m funny ‘cause he never did
I’ve been spending the last 8 months thinking all love ever does
Is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again
You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don’t know why I’m coming off a little shy
But I do
But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it’s strange that you think I’m funny ‘cause he never did
I’ve been spending the last 8 months thinking all love ever does
Is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again
And we walk down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches
Every single Christmas
And I won’t talk about that
For the first time, what’s past is past
‘Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it’s strange that you think I’m funny ‘cause he never did
I’ve been spending the last 8 months thinking all love ever does
Is break and burn and end
Then on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again
Then on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again
You should've been there,
Should've burst through the door
With that ""Baby I'm right here"" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so  happy
Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been, as I
Comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be  here
You said you'd, be  here
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no-one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And the hours pass by,
Now I just want to be alone,
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly ""He said he'd   be here""
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no-one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
What do you say when tears are
Streaming down your face in front of
Everyone you know?
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?
You should've been here,
And I would've been so  happy
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no-one to impress
And they're all sitting around me singing
""Happy Birthday To You""
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh, ohh, ohh, ohh, I knew
Oh, ohh, ohh, ohh,
And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it""
And I said, ""I'm sorry too""
And that was the moment I knew
You said it in a simple way
4am the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
We stumble through the long goodbye
One last kiss then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall
I told myself don't get attached
But in my mind I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you
This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would have played so nonchalance
Taxi cabs and busy streets
They never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you
This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here
Ahhh  Ahh  Ahh
This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York, be here, but you're in
London and I break down cause it's not fair
That you're not around
This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here
Ahh ohh, I don't want to miss you like this
Ahh ohh
Come back, be here,  come back, be here
Don't look at me you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah ah
Don't look at me you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do what's upstanding and right
It's kinda like a code yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But honey I am no-one's exception
This I have previously learned
So, don't look at me you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah ah
Don't look at me you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone and now you got me alone
And I say, don't look at me you've got a girl at home
I just wanna make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And yeah I might go with it
If I hadn't once been  just like her
So, don't look at me you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah ah
Don't look at me you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone and now you got me alone
And I say, don't look at me you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Ahh Ahh Ah
Ahh Ahh Ah
Call a cab
Lose my number
You're about to lose your girl
Call a cab
Lose my number
Let's consider this lesson learned
Don't look at me you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah ah
Don't look at me you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Wanna see you pick up your phone and tell her you're coming home
Don't look at me you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Don't look at me you've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
It would be a fine proposition
If I hadn't once been,
Just like her
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
And all we know, is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
Or fades in time
And I never (never), saw you coming
And I'll never, be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Now all we know... is don't let go
We are alone just you and me
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
So you were never a saint
But this love is brave and wild
And I never never, saw you coming
And I'll never, be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something
Good and right and real
And I never never, saw you coming
And I'll never, be the same
I never never, saw you coming
And I'll never, be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

7,Dont Forget Where You Belong (ver 2),One Direction,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/one-direction/dont-forget-where-you-belong-chords-1434050,"Been a lot of places
I've been all around the world
Seen a lot of faces
Never knowing where I was
On the horizon
Mmh, well, I know, I know, I know
The sun will be rising back home
Living out of cases
Packing up and taking off
Made a lot of changes
But not forgetting who I was
On the horizon
Oh and I know, I know, I know, I know,
The moon will be rising back home
Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
I've been away for ages
But I've got everything I need
I'm flicking through the pages
I've written in my memory
I feel like I'm dreaming
Oh, so I know, I know, I know, I know
That I'm never leaving
No, I won't go
Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
  Lights off when they should be on
  Even stars in the sky they're wrong
  Short days where the nights are long
  When I think of the things I've done
  Don't matter how far I've gone
  I'm always free to run home, oh
Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
Never, never, never
Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home

You were never on your own

You were never on your own

Don't forget it
No I'd never forget it
This song
You were never

Your kisses are the ocean breeze

Almost a decade older than me
And I've been gone for quite a while overseas, yeah...
And she's been living up in Albany
Then I had two shows I played up state
She came to show love and see my face
Then we got drinks and we chilled like ""hey""

My homies like ""you a dead man, dead man walking""

How did we let this happen, damn!
How did we end up in this bed then?""
I said ""relax"" and laughed like
""This would be a pretty dope song.""
She's like ""no, I swear to God I'll kill you
No, I really will just take your life
No, don't even think about it
But that would be a pretty dope song.""
So I came home and I called my friends
Then we got smacked and I wrote this jam
I know for a fact that I'm gonna be dead
It's over, My life is dead ass over.
Call my doctor, call my lawyer
Call my brother, call my priest
There's paperwork to fill out
Cause a dead man walks the streets
Cause my sister has a best friend
That I've known since I was three
And now I'm gon' get strangled

My homies like ""you a dead man, dead man walking""
My homies like ""dead man, dead man walking""

Yo no quiero ser un tipo de otro lado
 A tu manera, es complicado
 En una bici que te lleve a todos lados

Una cartica que yo guardo donde te escribí
Que te sueño y que te quiero tanto
Que hace rato esta mi corazón latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti
La que yo guardo donde te escribí
Que te sueño y que te quiero tanto
Que hace rato está mi corazón latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti
Puedo ser feliz
Caminando relajado entre la gente
Yo te quiero así
Y me gustas porque eres diferente

Que hace rato está mi corazón latiendo por ti, latiendo por ti
Ella es la favorita, la que cantan las olas
Se mueve su cadera como un barco en las olas
Tiene los pies descalzos como un niño que adora
Y su cabello largo son un sol que te antoja
Le gusta que le digan que la niña va lola
Le gusta que la miren cuando ella baila sola
Le gusta más la casa que no pasen las horas
Le gusta Barranquilla, le gusta Barcelona
Lleva, llévame en tu bicicleta
Óyeme, Carlos, llévame en tu bicicleta
Quiero que recorramos juntos esa zona
Desde Santa Marta hasta La Arenosa
Lleva, llévame en tu bicicleta
Pa' que juguemos bola, tapa y en chancleta

Though only in the hope that one day I would undress her
    Don't be offended
You think I'm 'bout to tell you that ""I love you""
But I really really really fucking don't
See the months of obsession
And crying for hours
I even started sitting down in the shower, girl
I'll take my time on my own
And I'll be fine now I'm alone
Constantly told stories with a stretch of the truth
Trying hard to make memories to remember from youth
Desperately wanting you to be interested too
It's not clear what I need yet
But it's clear it's not you
Here's what I'd say to any young man that's still interested in you
Do you prioritise the things in your life
The things that you hope to do
  Cause if not then
Mate you'd better trust me when I tell you that
It's not worth forgetting about yourself
She may seem perfect, and gorgeous, and lovely
You'll think she likes you
I mean I thought she loved me, no
But no

You build me up like building blocks just so you can bring me down
You can crush my candy cane but you'll never catch me cry
If you dangle that diploma and I deck you, don't be surprised
I know my ABC's, yet you keep teaching me
I say, fuck your degree, alphabet boy
You think you're smarter than me with all your bad poetry
Fuck all your ABC's, alphabet boy
I'm not a little kid now
Watch me get big now
Spell my name on the fridge now
With all your alphabet toys
You won the spelling bee now
But are you smarter than me now?
You're the prince of the playground
Little alphabet boy
Apples aren't always appropriate apologies
Butterscotch and bubblegum drops are bittersweet to me
You call me a child while you keep counting all your coins
But you're not my daddy and I'm not your dolly
And your dictionary's destroyed
I know my ABC's, yet you keep teaching me
I say, fuck your degree, alphabet boy
You think you're smarter than me with all your bad poetry

 palms reflecting in your eyes, like an endless summer.
 That's the way I feel for you,
 If time stood still, I'd take this moment
make it last forever.
 Your halo's full of fire, I'm rising up, rising up.
 My heart love's full of fire, love's full of fire,
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California,
be a freak like me too.
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need to feel
Like I do.
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it,
Talk 'til we both turn blue.
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California,
be a freak like me too.
 Leather black and eyes of blue (Blue, blue, blue)
 Sun reflecting in your eyes, like an easy rider,
 Life makes sense when I'm with you
 Looking back my past, it all seems stranger than a stranger
 So let's dance in slow motion, tear it up, tear it up.
 Let's dance by the ocean, ah, ah.
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California,
be a freak like me too.
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need to feel
Like I do.
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it,
Talk 'til we both turn blue.
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California,
be a freak like me too.
Oh, You're cold as ice baby, but when you're nice, baby,
it's so amazing in every way.
Oh, You're cold as ice baby, I don't wanna fight, baby,
it's like I told you; If you stay, I'll stay, yeah.
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California,
be a freak like me too.
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need to feel

We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it,

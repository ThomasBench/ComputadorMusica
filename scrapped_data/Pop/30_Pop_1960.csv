It really was such a night
The night was alight with stars above
Ooh, when she kissed me, I had to fall in love (break)
Oh, it was a kiss, ooh, what a kiss it was
It really was such a kiss
Oh, how she could kiss, ooh, what a kiss it was
It really was such a kiss
Just the thought of her lips, sets me a-fire
I reminisce and I'm filled with desire
But I gave my heart to her in sweet surrender
How well I remember, I'll always remember (break)
Oh, what a night, ooh, what a night it was
It really was such a night
Came the dawn
And my heart and her love and the night was gone
But I'll never forget-a the kiss
The kiss in the moonlight
Ooh, such a kiss, such a night  (break)
It was a night, ooh, what a night
It really was such a night
Came the dawn
And my heart and her love and the night was gone
But I'll never forget-a the kiss
The kiss in the moonlight
How well I remember, I'll always remember   (break)
Ph-ph ... that night,  ooh, what a night it was
It really was such a night
When we kissed, I had to fall in love
But I gave my heart to her in sweet surrender
How well I remember, I'll always remember (break)
Oh, what a night, ooh, what a night it was
It really was such a night
When we kissed, I had to fall in love
Well she's gone, gone, gone
Yes, she's gone, gone, gone
Came the dawn, dawn, dawn
And my love was gone
But before that dawn
Yes, before that dawn
And before that dawn
 Ooh      ooh       ooh       yeah
Such a night!

All you got is one life, living once can be rough
But if you live every day all the way ... once is enough
You can own just one suit, worn and torn at the cuff
But if you're livin' the life that you love ... once is enough
What's the good of reaching ninety
If you waste eighty-nine
You got one life so live it
  If you don't, it's a crime
Life's a playful puppy, you can grab by the scruff
And if you live every sec' what the heck ... once is enough
Never wait until tomorrow
What if it never comes
Life is a seven layer
  Don't you settle for crumbs
 Life's a playful puppy, you can grab by the scruff
And if you live every sec' what the heck ... once is enough
And if you live every sec' what the heck  ... once is enough
And if you live every sec' what the heck ...
Once is enough             (break)  (end)

If you really love me, like I love you-oo-oo..
you'd run right up to him and tell him that you're

Tell him you found somebody new..it's the only 
thing to do..why don't you tell him?
Is it cause you're lonely..is it cause you're blue-oo-oo?
Is it cause you still love him..could all this be true?
Why don't you tell me..tell me that it's over?
Tell me that you no longer care, for love you thought 
was there..why don't you tell me?
Get it over, baby..tell me, it's goodbye-eye-eye-eye.
Stop telling me lie-eye-eye-eyes..tell me goodbye..(Fade.)

Wait for me, and I'll be home any day now
I should have known, baby, right from the start
That you hold the key to my heart
Think of me and know I've been wronged
Can't you see that I've been gone too long
Since I've been gone, the girls have been few
But that key still belongs to you
I still remember the day I spent with you, love
We loved and cared from the start
You were so tender and knew what to do
You got the key to my heart
Smile for me, and try not to cry now
Wait for me, and I'll be home any day now
I should have known, baby, right from the start
That you hold the key to my heart
You hold the key to my heart
You hold the key to my heart
You hold the key to my heart

0,Viva La Vida,Coldplay,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/coldplay/viva-la-vida-chords-675427,"I used to rule the world 
Seas would rise when I gave the word 
Now in the morning I sleep alone 
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice 
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes 
Listen as the crowd would sing: 
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""
One minute I held the key 
Next the walls were closed on me 
And I discovered that my castles stand 
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand 
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing 
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing 
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield 
My missionaries in a foreign field 
For some reason I can't explain 
Once you go there was never, never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world 
It was the wicked and wild wind 
Blew down the doors to let me in. 
Shattered windows and the sound of drums 
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait 
For my head on a silver plate 
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king? 
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing 
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing 
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield 
My missionaries in a foreign field 
For some reason I can't explain 
I know Saint Peter won't call my name ,
never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world  
(Ohhhhh Ohhh Ohhh)
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing 
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing 
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield 
My missionaries in a foreign field 
For some reason I can't explain 
I know Saint Peter won't call my name ,
never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world  
Oooooh Oooooh Oooooh  x2

1,Make You Feel My Love,Adele,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/adele/make-you-feel-my-love-chords-752102,"  When the rain is blowing in your face

  To make you feel my love
  When evening shadows and the stars appear
  And there is no one there to dry your tears
  I could hold you for a million years
  To make you feel my love
  I know you haven't made your mind up yet
  But I would never do you wrong
  I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong
  I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
  I'd go crawling down the avenue
  No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
  To make you feel my love
  The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
  And on the highway of regret
  The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
  There’s nothing that I would not do
  Go to the ends of the earth for you
  To make you feel my love
  To make you feel my love

I will never be with you.

If I'm wrong I am right, don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love... But
If I tell the world, I'll never say enough
'Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do if I'd end up with you
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements

Waiting as my heart drops and my back begins to tingle

And they tell me
To breathe easy for a while
 But breathing gets harder
Even I know that
 You made room for me
But it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
 I'm unusually hard to hold on to
 Blank stares at  blank pages
 No easy way to say this
 You mean well,  but you make this hard on me
I'm not gonna write you a love song
Cause you asked for it
Cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
Cause you tell me it's
Make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leavin' im'a need a better reason
To write you a love song today,   today, yeah
 I learned the hard way
That they all say
Things you wanna hear
 And my heavy heart
Sings deep down under you
And your twisted words
Your help just hurts
You were not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry
 Convinced me  to please you
 Made me think that I need this too
 I'm trying  to let you hear me as I am
I'm not gonna write you a love song
Cause you asked for it
Cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
Cause you tell me it's
Make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leavin' im'a need a better reason
To write you a love song today
Promise me
You'll leave the light on
  To help me see
With daylight, my guide, gone
  Cause I believe there's a way
You can love me because I say
I won't write you a love song
Cause you asked for it
Cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
Cause you tell me it's
Make or break in this
Is that why you wanted a love song?
Cause you asked for it
Cause you need one, you see
I'm not gonna write you a love song
Cause you tell me it's
Make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If your heart is no where in it
I don't want it for a minute
Babe I'll walk the seven seas
When I believe that there's a reason
To write you a love song today,   today

  Coming towards her, stuck still no turning back...
  She hid around corners and she hid under beds
  She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
With every bubble she sank with her drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your loving, your loving behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come
And I never wanted anything from you
Except for everything you had and what was left after that too, oh
Happiness hit her like a bullet in the head.....
 Struck from a great height by someone who should know better than that
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers

I can't even convince myself

We are turning into dust
Playing house in the ruins of us
Running back through the fire

I just met this 5 foot 7 guy who's just my type
I like the way he's speaking, his confidence is peaking
Don't like his baggy jeans but I might like what's underneath them
And no, I ain't been to MIA
I heard that Cali never rains and New York's wide awake
First let's see the West End, I'll show you to my bedrin

Like they have any right at all to criticize
Hypocrites. You're all here for the very same reason.

But my God it's so beautiful when the boy smiles
Wanna hold him. Maybe I'll just sing about it

So cradle your head in your hands.
And breathe, just breathe, whoa breathe just breathe

You shout cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out 
And these mistakes you've made, you'll just make them again 
If you only try turnin' around
  2 AM and I'm still awake writing a song
If I get it all down on paper it's no longer inside of me 
Threatenin' the life it belongs to.
  And I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd
Cause these words are my diary screamin' out loud
And I know that you'll use them however you want to.
But you can't jump the track 
We're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table,

Sing it if you understand...

0,When I Was Your Man,Bruno Mars,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bruno-mars/when-i-was-your-man-chords-1198871,"  Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
  Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
  When our friends talk about you all it does is just tear me down
  Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
It all just sounds like ooh, ooh, oooh, oooh
Mmm too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing, but she's dancing with another man
  My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways
  Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made ooh
  And that haunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like ooh, ooh, oooh, oooh
Mmm too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing, but she's dancing with another man
Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours when he has the chance
Take you to every party cause I remember how much you love to dance
Do all the things I should've done when I was your man
Do all the things I should've done when I was your man

1,Photograph,Ed Sheeran,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ed-sheeran/photograph-chords-1493446,"Loving can hurt
Loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard
You know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We make these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And times forever frozen still
So you can keep me inside the pocket of your
Ripped jeans holding me closer till our
Eyes meet, you won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home
Loving can heal
Loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know
I swear it will get easier
remember that with every piece of ya
It is the only thing we take with us when we die
We keep this love in a photograph
We make these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And times forever frozen still
So you can keep me inside the pocket of your
Ripped jeans holding me closer till our
Eyes meet, you won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me that's okay baby, only
Words bleed inside these pages you just
Hold me, and I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Oh you can fit me, inside the necklace you got when you were
16 next to your heartbeat where I 
Should be, keep it deep within your soul.
And if you hurt me that's okay baby only 
Words bleed inside these pages you just
Hold me and I won't ever let you go.
When I'm away I will remember how you
Kissed me under the lamp post back on sixth street 
Hearing you whisper through the phone,
Wait for me to come home.

2,Love Yourself,Justin Bieber,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/justin-bieber/love-yourself-chords-1780199,"For all the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying, on my own, well I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone

Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

       And I can't sweep you off of your feet
      Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
    Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you till we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day 
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
   Take me into your loving arms
  Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
  Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are
       And when my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
   And the crowds don't remember my name
            When my hands don't play the strings the same way
        I know you will still love me the same
Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
  I'm thinking 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
That baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are

I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't o - ver

I wish nothing but the best for you two

Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instea - ead
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instea - ead

Only    yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a      summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

  I know I needed you
  But I never showed
  But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
  I wake you up with some
  Breakfast in bed
  I'll bring you coffee with 
  a kiss on your head
  And I'll take the kids to school
  Wave them goodbye
  And I'll thank my lucky stars 
  for that night
  When you looked over your shoulder
  For a minute, I forget that I'm older
  I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
  And I swear that everyday you'll get better
  You make me feel this way somehow
  I'm so in love with you
  And I hope you know
  Darling your love is more than
  Worth its weight in gold
  We've come so far my dear
  Look how we've grown
  And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
  I wanna live with you
  Even when we're ghosts
  Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most
  I'm gonna love you till
  My lungs give out
  I promise till death we part
Like in our vows
  So I wrote this song for you
  Now everybody knows
  That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go
Oh, just say you won't let go

  Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
  Told myself that you were right for me
  But felt so lonely in your company
  But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
  Like resignation to the end
Always the end
  So when we found that we could not make sense
  Well you said that we would still be friends
  But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
  But you didn't have to cut me off
  Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
  You didn't have to stoop so low
  Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
  Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
  But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
  And I don't wanna live that way

  You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...

 And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see

If perfect is what you're searching for, then just stay the same

I saw a piece of heaven

And I was running far away
Would I run off the world someday?

And I was dancing in the rain
I felt alive and I can't complain
But now take me home
Take me home where I belong
I can't take it anymore

The picture was a painting of you and
For a moment I thought you were here
But then again, it wasn't true
And all this time I have been lying
Oh, lying in secret to myself
I've been putting sorrow on the farrest place
On my shelf, da di da
And I was running far away
Would I run off the world someday?

If the whole world was watching I’d still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies they come alive when I’m next to you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
Mmm-mm-mm
Everything comes back to you
Mmm-mm-mm

Whistling my name
Open up a beer
And you say get over here
And play a video game

Watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown
I say you the bestest
Lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite perfume on
Go play a video game

I tell you all the time

Tell me all the things you want to do

Swinging with the old stars
Living for the fame
Kissing in the blue dark
Playing pool and wild darts
Video games

Drunk and I am seeing stars

Watching all our friends fall
In and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playing video games

That most days, I don't recognize me
That these shoes and this apron
Have taken more than I gave them
It's not easy to know
I'm not anything that I used to be although
It's true, I was never attention's sweet center
I still remember that girl
She's imperfect but she tries
She is good but she lies
She is hard on herself
She is broken and won't ask for help
She is messy but she's kind
She is lonely most of the time
She is all of this mixed up and
baked in a beautiful pie
She is gone but she used to be mine
And it's not what I asked for
Sometimes life just slips in through a backdoor
and carves out a person and makes you believe it's all true
And you're not what I asked for
If I'm honest I know I would give it all back
for a chance to start over
And rewrite an ending or two
Who'd be reckless just enough
Who'd get hurt but who learns how to toughen up
When she's bruised and gets used
By a man who can't love
And be scared of the life that's inside her
Growing stronger each day
To fight just a little
To bring back the fire in her eyes
That's been gone but used to be mine
Used to be mine
She is messy but she's kind
She is lonely most of the time
She is all of this mixed up

She is gone but she used to be mine

 Oh, as I die here another day

You look away from me and I see there's something you're trying to hide
And I reach for your hand but it's cold you pull away again
And I wonder what's on your mind
  And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake
  You start to tremble and your voice begins to break
You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend’s, They were my mate’s
And I feel the colour draining from my face
  ""I know you love her, but it's over, mate

  It's never easy to walk away,
let her go oh oh oh

And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head
  And everything deleted like the past yea it was gone
And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on
  But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday
It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake
And everything I know tells me that I should walk away
But I just want to stay

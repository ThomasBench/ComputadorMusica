0,Remind Me To Forget,Kygo,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/kygo/remind-me-to-forget-chords-2344313,"It never fades away, it's staying
Your kiss like broken glass on my skin
And all the greatest loves end in violence
It's tearing up my voice, left in silence
Baby, it hit so hard, holding on to my chest
Maybe you left your mark, reminding me to forget
It doesn't matter where you are, you can keep my regret
'Cause baby, I got these scars, reminding me to forget
Reminding me, I got these scars, get your love
Keep reminding me, ooh, to forget your love
You left your mark (my heart)
You left your mark, reminding me to forget
You left your mark (my heart)
You left your mark (understand)
You left your mark (my heart)
You left your mark, reminding me to forget
You left your mark (my heart)
You left your mark (understand)
There's no room in war for feelings
Hurt me to the core, still healing
And I know you're no good for me
So I try to forget the memories
Baby, it hit so hard, holding on to my chest
Maybe you left your mark, reminding me to forget
It doesn't matter where you are, you can keep my regret
Baby, I got these scars, reminding me to forget
You left your mark (my heart)
You left your mark, reminding me to forget
You left your mark (my heart)
You left your mark (understand)
Remember I told you
To save it, it's over
And I'll be alright
So hurt me as much as you like
I need you to let go
I got these mementos
And I'll be alright
Baby, it hit so hard, holding on to my chest
Maybe you left your mark, reminding me to forget
It doesn't matter where you are, you can keep my regret
Baby, I got these scars, reminding me to forget
You left your mark (my heart)
You left your mark, reminding me to forget

1,Your Song (ver 2),Lady Gaga,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lady-gaga/your-song-chords-2680929,"It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a woman who makes potions on a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

Or how the dong came to own a luminous nose
Or how the jumblies went to sea in a sieve that they rowed

These salty tears on my cheeks
That's what a year long headache
Does to you

Always trying to make my keeper mine

Sailing off on the ships to nowhere
Got a lot of things to clear away
Got a lot of years of bad love to make okay
It gets me every day

True love is making a comeback
For only half of us, the rest just feel bad
Doomed to wander in the world's first rodeo
You never let it show
The other night, I was at a party
And someone sincerely looked at me
And said, ""Is this the end of all monogamy?""
And I said, ""Not today
Then again, you might be right
Then again, sleep the night""

At first I thought that I was dreamin'
But then I heard the voice of a girl
And it sounded like she'd been cryin'
Now I'm too worried to be sleepin'
So I took the elevator to the second floor
Walked down the hall and then I knocked upon her door
She opened up and I asked about the things I've been hearing
She said, ""I think your ears are playing tricks on you""
Sweater zipped up to her chin
""Thanks for caring, sir, that's nice of you
But I have to go back in
Wish I could tell you about the noise
But I didn't hear a thing""
She said, ""It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind""
She said, ""It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind""
So I was layin' on the floor of my room
Cold concrete on my back
No, I just couldn't shake the feeling
I didn't want to intrude because I knew that I didn't have all the facts
But I couldn't bear the thought of leavin' her
So I took the elevator to the second floor
Walked down the hall and then I knocked upon her door
She opened up and I asked about the things I've been hearing
She said, ""I think your ears are playing tricks on you""
Sweater zipped up to her chin
""Thanks for caring, sir, that's nice of you
But I have to go back in
Wish I could tell you about the noise
But I didn't hear a thing""
She said, ""It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind""
She said, ""It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind""
Aim my boom box at the roof, I'm playing ""lean on me""
Just so that she knows that she can lean on me
And when she hears the words, I hope she knows she'll be okay
Aim my boom box at the roof, I'm playing ""lean on me""
Just so that she knows that she can lean on me
And when she hears the words, I know exactly what I'll say
Promise I'm not playing tricks on you
You're always welcome to come in
You could stay here for an hour or two
If you ever need a friend
We can talk about the noise, when you're ready, but till then
I say, ""It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind""
I say, ""It must have been the wind, must have been the wind
Must have been the wind, it must have been the wind""

And never, never, never ever let go
Blood on my shirt, rose in my hand
You're looking at me like you don't know who I am
Blood on my shirt, heart in my hand
Fight so dirty, but your love's so sweet
Talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go
Fight so dirty, but your love's so sweet
Talk so pretty, but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go
Never, never, never ever let go

49,False God (ver 2),Taylor Swift,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/taylor-swift/false-god-chords-2804306,"We were crazy to think
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
We were stupid to jump
Remember how I’d fly to you?
And I can't talk to you when you're like this
I'm New York City
They all warned us about times like this
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We’d still worship this love
I know heaven's a thing
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Got the wine for you
And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
You're the West Village
They all warned us about times like this
When you’re led by blind faith, blind faith
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love, ah
Still worship this love
Even if it's a false god
Still worship this love

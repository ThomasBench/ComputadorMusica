 Sex don't sleep when the lights are off
 Kids are still depressed when you dress them up

 How did you afford this ring that I love, honey?
 ""Just another shift at the drug company,""

Gone for someone else to share
Oh, I'm jealous of the love, cause
I wished you the best of
All this world could give
And I told you when you left me
There's nothing to forgive
But I always thought you'd come back, tell me all you found was
Heartbreak and misery
It's hard for me to say, I'm jealous of the way
You're happy without me
As I sink in the sand
Watch you slip through my hands
Oh, as I die here another day

Late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling

We're going through the motions
Hopin' you'd stop
And oh I've only caused you pain
I know but all of my words
Will always below
Although all the lie we spoke

Everywhere you go;
Take a look in the five-and-ten, glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
Toys in every store,
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own  front door.
A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well,
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start,
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within   your heart.
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas,
Toys in every store,
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own  front door.
Sure it's Christmas once more.

and so does war
It's survival of the fittest
rich against the poor
at the end of the day
It's a human trait
hidden deep down inside of our DNA
One man can build a bomb
another run a race
to save somebody's life
and have it blow up in his face
i'm not the only one who
finds it hard to understand
i'm not afraid of god
i am afraid of man
is it running in our blood
is it running in our veins
is it running in our genes
is it in our DNA
Humans aren't gonna behave
as we think we always should
yeah, we can be bad as we can be good
Underneath it all we're just savages
hidden behind shirts, ties and marriages
How could we expect anything at all?
we're just animals still learning how to crawl
we live, we die
we steal, we kill, we lie
just like animals
but with far less grace
we laugh, we cry
like babies in the night
forever running wild
in the human race
another day, another tale of rape
another ticking bomb to bury deep and detonate
i'm not the only one who finds it hard to understand
i'm not afraid of god
i'm afraid of man
you can see it on the news
you can watch it on tv
you can read it on your phone
you can say it's troubling
Humans aren't gonna behave
as we think we always should
yeah, we can be bad as we can be good
Underneath it all we're just savages
hidden behind shirts, ties and marriages
How could we expect anything at all?
we're just animals still learning how to crawl
Underneath it all we're just savages
hidden behind shirts, ties and marriages
Truth is in us all, cradle to the grave
we're just animals still learning to behave
All the hate coming out from a generation
who got everything + nothing guided by temptation
were we born to abuse, shoot a gun + run
or has something deep inside of us come undone?
is it a human trait or is it learned behaviour
are you killing for yourself or killing for your saviour? 
Underneath it all we're just savages
hidden behind shirts, ties and marriages
How could we expect anything at all?
we're just animals still learning how to crawl
Underneath it all we're just savages
hidden behind shirts, ties and marriages
Truth is in us all, cradle to the grave
we're just animals still learning to behave

By moving bricks to Brixton
And learning how to fix them

 Nice to meet you, where you been... I can show you incredible things 
 ""Oh my God, look at that face.. you look like my next mistake
 Love’s a game, want to play?""
 New money, suit and tie... I can read you like a magazine
 Ain't it funny? Rumors fly and I know you heard about me 
 Grab your passport and my hand
 I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
 So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames
 You can tell me when it's over hmmm, if the high was worth the pain
 Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
 Cause you know I love the players and you love the game
 Cause were young and we're reckless, we'll take this way too far
 It'll leave you breathless hmmm, or with a nasty scar
 Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
 But I got a blank space baby and I""ll write your name
 Cherry lips, crystal skies.... I could show you incredible things
 Stolen kisses, pretty lies... you're the king baby I'm your queen
 Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no
 Screaming crying perfect storms... I can make all the tables turn
 ""Oh my god who is she? I get drunk on jealousy""
 But you'll come back each time you leave
 Cause darlin' I'm a nightmare, dressed like a daydream
 So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames
 You can tell me when it's over hmmm, if the high was worth the pain
 Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane

All that I have is on the floor
    God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more
I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you, what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
     Under haunted skies I see, oooh
      Where love is lost, your ghost is found
     I braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no I will never be knocked down
I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you, what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables

When the thunder calls for me
Next time I'll be braver, I'll be my own saviour
Standing on my own two feet

No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me

mä oon joku outo tulokas uusi asukas, niin ne puhuvat
Ne sanoo mä oon menninkäinen
En lihaa enkä verta oo
Mul on vähän noidan kykyjä, velhonäkijä, niin ne puhuvat
Mut vaikka mä uskon ihmeisiin, en taikoja tehdä voi
Kun mua sattuu, kun sydämessä veitset kääntyy
Mä vapisen niin kuin jokainen ihminen, kuolevainen
Jos tää loppuu, jos tänä yönä rakkaus päättyy
Mä hajoan niin kuin jokainen ihminen, kuolevainen, kuolevainen
Ne sanoo että maiset murheet ei paina mua ollenkaan
Ne puhuu siitä silmät palaen, tieto salainen ympäröi mua
Ne näkee kyllä kyyneleeni, mut ne ei tule halaamaan
Ja lapsille on helppo sanoa tuntemattomia täytyy varoa
Mut vaikka mä uskon ihmeisiin, en taikoja tehdä voi
Kun mua sattuu, kun sydämessä veitset kääntyy

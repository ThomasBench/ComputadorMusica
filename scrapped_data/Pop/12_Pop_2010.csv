0,California,Lana Del Rey,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lana-del-rey/california-chords-2800601,"   You don't ever have to
Be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms
Baby, you don't ever have to
Go faster than your fastest pace
Or faster than my fastest cars
I shouldn't have done it but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to reach out but I never said a thing
I shouldn't have done it but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to call you but I didn't say a thing (two, three, four)
Ohh-oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flipside
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever, have fun
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we'll dance till dawn
I'll pick up all of your Vogues and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top-shelf
I'll throw a party, all night long
   You don't ever have to
Be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms
And honey, you don't ever have to
Act cooler than you think you should
You're brighter than the brightest stars
You're scared to win, scared to lose
I've heard the war was over if you really choose
The one in and around you
You hate the heat, you got the blues
You're changing like the weather, oh, that's so like you
The same wind that moves you (two, three, four)
Ohh-oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flipside
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever, have fun
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we'll dance till dawn
I'll pick up all of your Vogues and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top-shelf
I'll throw a party, all night long
Ohh-oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flipside
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up

1,Bartender,Lana Del Rey,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lana-del-rey/bartender-chords-2800655,"   All the ladies of the canyon
   Wearing black to their house parties
   Crosby, Stills and Nash is playing
   Wine is flowing with Bacardi
   But sometimes,   girls just 
   Want to have fun
   The poetry,   inside of me
   Is warm like a gun
I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
It'll buy me a year if I play my cards right
Photo free exits from baby's bedside
'Cause they don't yet know what car I drive
I'm just tryna keep my love alive
With my bartender, hold me all night
Bartender, our love's alive
Baby remember, I'm not drinking wine
But that cherry coke you serve is fine
And our love's sweet enough on the vine
Bartender,   bar-t-t-tender
   All the ladies of the canyon
   Wearing white for their tea parties
   Playing games of repetition
   Meditating in the garden
   And I love,   the little games that we play
From the valley to the beach
   And when at last,   the day is done
   I grab my keys
I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
It'll buy me a year if I play my cards right
Photo free exits from baby's bedside
'Cause they don't yet know what car I drive
I'm just tryna keep my love alive
With my bartender, hold me all night
Bartender, our love's alive
Baby remember, I'm not drinking wine
But that cherry coke you serve is fine
And our love's sweet enough on the vine
Bar-t-t-tender, bar-t-t-tender
Bar-t-t-tender, ha ha ha ha
I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
60 mph on PCH drive
Head to Long Beach to Newport by your side
As they don't yet know where I reside
60 miles from the last place I hide
With my bar-t-t-tender, hold me all night
Bar-t-t-tender, keep love alive

Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet

Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

(Oh!) Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright
(Uh!) Three times 'cause I've waited my whole life

And I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh-huh, that's right, darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames,  in dirty dreams
Ah-oh, you're the one I want
  In the winter in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
Honey, without all the exes, fights and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so
(Ay!) Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night

4,Off To Sea,The Longest Johns,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-longest-johns/off-to-sea-chords-3151433,"When first I landed in Liverpool, I went upon the spree
With money at last, I spent it fast, I got drunk as drunk could be,
But when my money was all gone, it was then that I wanted more,
But a man must be blind to make up his mind to go to sea once more.
Once more, once more, go to sea once more,
But a man must be blind to make up his mind,
To go to sea once more.
And as I walked down London Road I met with a Rapper Brown,
I asked him if he'd take me in and he looked at me with a frown,
He said: ""Last time you was paid off, to me you chalked no score,
But I'll give you a chance and I'll take your advance, and I'll send you to sea once more.""
Once more, once more, send you to sea once more,
But I'll give you a chance and I'll take your advance
And I'll send you to go to sea once more.
I shipped on board of a whaling barque, we were bound for the Greenland seas
Where cold winds blow through frost and snow, why Jamaica rum would freeze
And worst to bear, I'd no hard weather gear, as I'd spent all my money ashore
It was then that I wished that I was dead and could go to sea no more
No more, no more, go to sea no more
It was then that I wished that I was dead
And could go to sea no more
Some times we're catching whales, my lads, some times we're catching none
With a twenty-foot oar stuck in your paw, from four o'clock in the morn
And as the shades of night roll on and you rest on your weary oar,
It was then that I wished that I was dead and could go to sea no more
No more, no more, go to sea no more
It was then that I wished that I was dead
And could go to sea no more
So come all you hard weather sailing lads, who listen to my song
When you get back from those long trips, I'd have you not go wrong
Take my advice, drink no strong drink, don't you knock on that brothel door
But get married instead and spend all night in bed, and go to sea no more.
No more, no more, go to sea no more
But get married instead and spend all night in bed,
And go to sea no more.
No more, no more, go to sea no more
But get married instead and spend all night in bed,
And go to sea no more.

The cat who got the cream

That I never am happy

Driven by a greed to succeed
Nobody can stop me
Cause it's my problem
If I wanna pack up and run away
It's my business if I feel the need to
Smoke and drink and sway
It's my problem, it's my problem
If I feel the need to hide
And it's my problem if I have no friends
And feel I want to die

Of the cowardly way of being, that comes from energies combined

Turn the TV on, Throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't, nah

Click to MTV so they can teach me how to dougie

Guess this is the winter, our bodies are young and blue
I'm at Jungle City, it's late and this song is for you
Cause I remember the rush, when forever was us
Before all of the winds of regret and mistrust
Now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost
Well I guess I should go, yeah I guess I should go
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold, oh oh
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God I wish I believed you when you told me this was my home, oh oh
I light all the candles, cut flowers for all my rooms
I care for myself the way I used to care about you
These days, we kiss and we keep busy, the waves come after midnight
  I call from underwater, why even try to get right?
   When you've outgrown a lover, the whole world knows but you
  It's time to let go of this endless summer afternoon

When sweet words and fevers all leave us right here in the cold, oh oh
Alone with the hard feelings of love

Now I'll fake it every single day 'til I don't need fantasy, 'til I feel you leave
But I still remember everything, how we'd drift buying groceries, how you'd dance for me
I'll start letting go of little things 'til I'm so far away from you, far away from you, yeah

It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn't see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason
X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we never get far
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinkin'
And I was just drinkin'
Well, he was runnin' after us, I was screamin', ""go, go, go!""
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And now we're both sorry (we're both sorry)

He poisoned the well, every man for himself

There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Think about the place where you first met me

No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
 We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (oh-oh)
Until I switched to the other side
 It's no surprise I turned you in (oh-oh)
'Cause us traitors never win
 I'm in a getaway car
 I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me
Drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we never get far (don't pretend)
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart (should've known)

4am the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
We stumble through the long goodbye
One last kiss then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall
I told myself don't get attached
But in my mind I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you
  This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
  I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here
The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would have played so nonchalant
Taxi cabs and busy streets
They never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you
  This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
  I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here
Aaaahhh   Aaaahhh 
  This is falling in love in the cruelest way
  This is falling for you when you are worlds away
  In New York, be here, but you're in
  London and I break down cause it's not fair
That you're not around
This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this

45,Story Of My Life (ver 9),One Direction,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/one-direction/story-of-my-life-chords-1427442,"Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone
And I'll be gone gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I been holdin' on too tight
With nothing in between
The story of my life I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time...
Is frozen the story of, the story of
The story of my life I give her hope.
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life the story of, the story of
Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the mornin' I'll see a single light upon a hill
Although I am broken my heart is untamed still
And I'll be gone gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I been holdin' on so tight
With nothing in between
The story of my life I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time...
Is frozen the story of, the story of
The story of my life I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life the story of, the story of
And I been waiting for this time to come around
But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds
The story of my life I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time...
Is frozen
The story of my life I give her hope give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside until she's broke inside
The story of my life the story of, the story of
The story of my life
The story of my life the story of, the story of
The story of my life

I said real love
It's like feeling no fear when you're standing in the face of danger
     'Cause you just want it so much
A touch
From your real love
It's like heaven taking the place of something evil
And lettin' it burn off from the rush, yeah, yeah
And darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined
Love, is it real love?
It's like smiling when the firing squad's against you
But you just stay lined up, yeah, yeah
'Cause darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined
My rose garden dreams
Set on fire by fiends
And all my black beaches are ruined
My celluloid scenes
Are torn at the seams
And I fall to pieces
   'Cause I love you so much
I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined, are ruined
   Mmm mm-mm, are ruined
And I fall to pieces

47,Cold Coffee,Ed Sheeran,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ed-sheeran/cold-coffee-chords-1026020,"  She’s like cold coffee in the morning
  I’m drunk off last night’s whisky and coke
  She’ll make me shiver without warning
  And make me laugh, as if I’m in on joke
And you can stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now
And tell me if I’m wrong
And tell me if I’m right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love
The way you want me to
  I’ll wake with coffee in the morning
  But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea
  Outside, the day is up and calling
  But I don’t have to be
Stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now
And tell me if I’m wrong
And tell me if I’m right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love
The way you want me to
'Cause I love the way you wake me up
For goodness sake, will my love not be enough?
And tell me if I’m wrong
And tell me if I’m right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
  To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love
The way you want me to
Tell me if I’m wrong
And tell me if I’m right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight

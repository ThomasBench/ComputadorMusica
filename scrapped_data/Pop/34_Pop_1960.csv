0,Edge Of Reality,Elvis Presley,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/elvis-presley/edge-of-reality-chords-1928639," I walk along a thin line darling
Dark shadows follow me
 Here's where life's dream lies disil-lusioned
The edge of reality
 Oh I can hear strange voices echo
Laughing with mockery
The border line of doom I'm facing
The edge of reality
On the edge of reality she sits there tormenting me
The girl with the nameless face
On the edge of reality where she overpowers me
With fears that I can't explain
 She drove me to the point of madness
The brink of misery
 If she's not real then I'm condemned to
The edge of reality
On the edge of reality she sits there tormenting me
The girl with the nameless face
On the edge of reality where she overpowers me
With fears that I can't explain
 She drove me to the point of madness
The brink of misery
 If she's not real then I'm condemned to
The edge of reality
Reality, reality, reality, reality
Reality, reality, reality, reality

It didn't pay much 'cause the place was just a dive
Then one night I saw her in the crowd
And she asked if singing with the band would be allowed
It was just weekday night
So, I said it would be alright
That's how I met the girl who sang the blues
She sang the blues like no-one has ever heard
And you could tell that she'd lived every word
That girl was somethin' special we could see
Then she sang a song of love and looked at me
That girl could do no wrong
So, I let her sing all night long
And I fell in love with the girl who sang the blues
I still remember that fateful night
The man with a big cigar
Walked in the club right up to her
Said ""Hey girl I'm gonna make you a star""
The band and I still play from nine to five
But since that night the music ain't alive
That girl still sings the songs to me I know
But now she's singin' 'em on the radio
And it hurts to realize
I'm just one of a million guys
In love with the girl, the girl who sings the blues
In love with the girl, with the girl who sings the blues
In love with the girl, with the girl who sings the blues

This heart of mine is singing right along
Don't know where I'm going
Don't know where it ends
Till the grass is greener, beyond the bend
I haven't got a care
I'm just on my way to anywhere
Pocketful of nothing
Nothing I can spend
Hope the grass is greener, beyond the bend

Playing second fiddle now (second fiddle now)
Someday you'll want me, dear
And when that day is here
Within my arms you'll come to know
Other loves may come and go
But my love for you will be
Eternally
 Look around and you will see (you will see)

0,The Lonely (ver 2),Christina Perri,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/christina-perri/the-lonely-chords-1083158,"2am where do I begin,
Crying off my face again.
The silent sound of loneliness
Wants to follow me to bed.
I'm a ghost of a girl that I want to be most.
I'm the shell of a girl that I used to know well.
Dancing slowly in an empty room
Can the lonely take the place of you?
I sing myself a quiet lullaby
Let you go and let the lonely in
To take my heart again
Too afraid to go inside
For the pain of one more loveless night.
But the loneliness will stay with me
And hold me til I fall asleep.
I'm a ghost of a girl that I want to be most.
I'm the shell of a girl that I used to know well.
Dancing slowly in an empty room
Can the lonely take the place of you?
I sing myself a quiet lullaby
Let you go and let the lonely in
To take my heart again
Broken pieces of
A barely breathing story
Where there once was love
Now there's only me and the lonely.
Dancing slowly in an empty room
Can the lonely take the place of you?
I sing myself a quiet lullaby
Let you go and let the lonely in
To take my heart again

heights
With a heart that's beating at the
speed of light
You've been waiting for this feeling
all your life
Sometimes it's just hard to realize
When you're stuck in a moment, and
your spark has been stolen, this is
our time to own it, so own it

in our eyes, eyes
With fire n' gold in our eyes, eyes
Got lightning in a bottle, hands on
the throttle, even in the dust we
shine
With fire n' gold in our eyes, eyes

you and I
And I feel like I have known you my
whole life

 Tryin so hard not to cry
 Had the best time and now its the worst time
 But we have to say goodbye
 Don't promise that you're gonna write
 Don't promise that you'll call
 Just promise that you won't forget we had it all
 Cause you were mine for the Summer
 Now we know its nearly over
 Feels like snow in September
 But I always will remember
 You were my Summer love
 You always will be my Summer love
 Wish that we could be alone now
 If we could find some place to hide
 Make the last time just like the first time
 Push a button and rewind
 Don't say the word that's on your lips
 Don't look at me that way
 Just promise you'll remember
 When the sky is grey
 Cause you were mine for the Summer
 Now we know its nearly over
 Feels like snow in September
 But I always will remember
 You were my Summer love
 You always will be my Summer love
 So please don't make this any harder
 We can't take this any farther
 And I know there's nothin that I wanna change, change
 Cause you were mine for the Summer
 Now we know its nearly over
 Feels like snow in September
 But I always will remember
 You were my Summer love
 You always will be my Summer love
 You always will be my Summer love

They'll always disappoint you

Don't love the ones who trust you

You're a teasing little twister and
They're dancers in the dark, oh but
I wish I had a lover who'd keep it undercover
We could live our dreams, we'd sail on golden wings
I wish I had a lover, someone who wouldn't bother
To tell me what to feel
To tell me what is real
It's not a lot I'm asking for
They'll kiss you in the evening, devils in disguise, and
Love you 'till the morning then vanish before your eyes
A walking disaster can also master
A graceful posture, but where's the dignity when
I wish I had a lover who'd keep it undercover
We could live our dreams, we'd sail on golden wings
I wish I had a lover, someone who wouldn't bother

Walk with shame, I follow on
A language to find hard to hear
Not to understand, just disappear

   Would be to me,         the greatest thing
   To hold your heart,      hold your hand
   Would be to me,        the bravest thing
   Could you take my place and stand here?
   I do not think you'd take this pain
   You'll be on your knees and struggle under the weight
   Oh, the truth would be a beautiful thing
   Oh, the truth is a beautiful thing
I wear another thought of you
There's so much home I give to you
Hide you somewhere they don't know
Deep in my call you know you have a throne

A little party never hurt no one, so we stay out late.
A little party never hurt no one, that's what your friends say.
You put your life out on the line, you're crazy all the time.
Put your life out on the line, you're crazy all the time.
You're so Art Deco out on the floor,
shining like gun metal, cold and unsure.
Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score,
when they all say hello, you try to ignore them.
'Cause you want more, why? You want more, why?
You want more, why? 'Cause you want more.
A little party never hurt no one, not you and me.
A little party never hurt no one, we were born to be free.
Time present and time past
and time future contained in time past.
If all time is eternally present,
What might have been is an abstraction,
Only in a world of speculation,
Point to one end, which is always present,
Down the passage which we did not take
into the rose garden.
  Everything is fine now, let sleeping dogs lay,
all our minds made up now, all our beds are made.
No one's out of time, no, Chips fall wherever they may.
Leave it all behind, let the ocean wash it away.
It never was about the money or the drugs,
for you, there's only love. For you, there's only love.
It never was about the party or the clubs,
for you, there's only love.
  'Cause you're my religion, you're how I'm living,
when all my friends say I should take some space
well, I can't envision that for a minute.
When I'm down on my knees, you're how I pray,
Hallelujah, I need your love,
Hallelujah, I need your love.
  Everything is bright now, no more cloudy days.
Even when the storms come, in the eye we'll stay
No need to survive now, all we do is play,
all I hear is music like Lay Lady Lay.
It never was about the money or the drugs,
for you, there's only love. For you, there's only love.
It never was about the party or the clubs,
for you, there's only love.
  'Cause you're my religion, you're how I'm living,
when all my friends say I should take some space
well, I can't envision that for a minute.
When I'm down on my knees, you're how I pray,
Hallelujah, I need your love,
Hallelujah, I need your love.
You're my religion, you're how I'm living,
when all my friends say I should take some space
well, I can't envision that for a minute.
When I'm down on my knees, you're how I pray,
Hallelujah, I need your love,
Hallelujah, I need your love.
All the lights in Miami begin to gleam,
ruby, blue and green, neon too.
Everything looks better from above my king,
like aquamarine, ocean's blue.
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, Cacciatore.
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da, limousines.
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ciao amore.
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da, soft ice cream.
All the lights are sparkling for you it seems,
on the downtown scenes, shady blue.
Beatboxing and rapping in the summer rain,
like a boss, he sang Jazz and Blues.
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, Cacciatore.
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da, limousines.
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ciao amore.
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da, soft ice cream.
The summer's wild, and I've been waiting for you all this time.
I adore you, can't you see you're meant for me?
Summer's hot but I've been cold without you,
I was so wrong not to tell, I'm in regine, tangerine dreams.
Catch me if you can, working on my tan, Salvatore.
Dying by the hand of a foreign man happily,
calling out my name in the summer rain, ciao amore.
Salvatore can wait, now it's time to eat soft ice cream
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, Cacciatore.
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da, limousines.
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ciao amore.
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da, soft ice cream.
Give me all, got my blue nail polish on.
It's my favorite color and my favorite tone of song,
I don't really wanna break up, we got it going on,
it's what you gathered from my talk, but you were wrong.
It's not easy for me to talk about a half life in lost dreams,
I'm not simple, it's trigonometry. It's hard to express,
 Ever since my baby went away
it's been the blackest day, it's been the blackest day.
 All I hear is Billie Holiday, 
it's all that I play, it's all that I play.
Because I'm going deeper and deeper, harder and harder,
getting darker and darker, looking for love
in all the wrong places, oh my god.
in all the wrong places, oh my god.
Carry me home, got my new car and my gun.
Wind in my hair, holding your hand, listen to a song.
Carry me home, don't wanna talk about the things to come,
just put your hands up in the air, the radio on.
'Cause there's nothing for us to talk about like the future and those things,
'Cause there's nothing for me to think about now that he's gone 
 Ever since my baby went away
it's been the blackest day, it's been the blackest day.
 All I hear is Billie Holiday, 
it's all that I play, it's all that I play.
Because I'm going deeper and deeper, harder and harder,
getting darker and darker, looking for love
in all the wrong places, oh my god.
in all the wrong places, oh my god.
You should've known better than to have to let her,
get you under her spell of the weather.
I got you where I want you, you did it, I never.
I'm falling for forever, I'm playing the game since.
I got you where I want you, I got you, I got you.
I got you where I want you now.
 Ever since my baby went away
it's been the blackest day, it's been the blackest day.
 All I hear is Billie Holiday, 
it's all that I play, it's all that I play.
It's not one of those phases I'm going through,
or just a song. 
It's no one else's, I'm on my own.
On my own, on my own again.
I'm on my own again, I'm on my own again,
I'm on my own again, I'm on my own again.
There's only 24 hours in a day,
and half as many ways for you to lie to me, my little love.
There's only 24 hours in a day,
and half of those, you lay awake with thoughts of murder and carnage.
If you lie down with dogs then you'll get fleas,
be careful of the company you keep.
There's only 24 hours and that's not enough
to lie like you lie or love like you love.
There's only 24 hours in a day, 
and half of those you lay between the sheets with me, my lying love.
There's only 24 hours, so you'd say
for most of them you pay for all the things they paid you for, my love.
If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
be careful of the ones you choose to leave.
There's only 24 hours and that's not enough
to lie like you lie or love like you love.
Give me your heat, give me your diamonds.
You hit that street and my crooked lust.
You count to three while they're all dying,
You're hard to reach, you're cold to touch.
 Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me,
 Why work so hard when you could just be free?
 You got your moment now, you got your legacy.
 Let's leave the world for the ones who change everything.
  Nothing could stop the two of us,
  let's just get lost, that's what we want.
And I will never sing again, and you won't work another day,
I will never sing again with just one wave it goes away.
It will be our swan song, it will be our swan song,
be our swan song, It will be our swan song.
  Darling, dive deep and dark blue suede,
 Rushing up from the water where the ice meets.
  And you've been gone so long, you missed everything,
 The world can change in a day if you go away.
But nothing could stop the two of us,
 If that's what we want, we could just get lost
And I will never sing again, and you won't work another day,
I will never sing again with just one wave it goes away.
It will be our swan song, it will be our swan song,
be our swan song, It will be our swan song.
Live your life,
live your life, where you've been.
Where you're going to? Going to.
Say good night,
say good night to the life in the world we live.
I'm going to follow you.  
And I will never sing again, and you won't work another day,
And I will never sing again, you won't work another day,
It will be our swan song, it will be our swan song,
be our swan song, It will be our swan song.
 Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me,
 Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me,
 Why you work so hard when you could just be free?
Baby, you understand me now?
 If sometimes you see that I'm mad
don't you know, no one alive can always be an angel?
 When everything goes wrong, you see some bad.
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good,
oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood.
You know sometimes, baby, I'm so carefree,
with a joy that's hard to hide.
And then sometimes, again, it seems that all I have is worry,
and then you're bound to see my other side.
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good,
oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood.
If I seem edgy I want you to know
I never meant to take it out on all you.
Life has its problems and I get more than my share,
but that's one thing I never mean to do, 'cause I love you.
 Oh baby, I'm just human,
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?
Sometimes I find myself alone regretting
some little foolish thing, some simple thing that I've done.
'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good,
oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood.
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood

 Mä istuin jo takapenkillä, hymy korvissa vöihin köytettynä
 Dingo lauloi nahkatakkista tyttöä
 Ukki kertoi jatkosodasta, siitä alikersantti Rokasta
 En mä tuolloin mistään tajunnut, nautin vain lomasta

 lupaan että saunaan vettä vien
 Muistan kivet ja kannot tän soratien

 ralli-idoli pienten poikien
 Faija nauroi, mutsi pelkäsi katsoa
 Kesä loppui ja mulle kerrottiin, ei tule enää reissuja Evitskogiin
 Vanhemmat eros ja mökki myytiin
 Kävin eilen ajamassa mökkitien, muistin, että kauemmin se vie
 Tutut reitit vaihtuneet pintoihin mustiin
 Ei ukkikaan kerro enää sodasta,  se kasvaa heinää Honkanummella
 Nyt paremmin ymmärrän tarinan ja hänen tekojaan arvostan

Not gonna fake it, not when you go down
Cause this is my game and you better come to play
I used to hold my freak back, now I'm letting go
I make my own choice, yes I run the show
So leave the lights on, no you can't make me behave
So you say I'm complicated, that I must be out my mind
But you've had me underated
What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident? oh oh oh
What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident? oh oh oh
It's time to get the chains out, is your tongue tied up
Cause this is my ground and I'm dangerous
And you can get off but it's all 'bout me tonight
So you say I'm complicated, that I must be out my mind
But you've had me underated
What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident? oh oh oh
What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident? oh oh oh
So you say I'm complicated but you've had me underated

What's wrong with being confident? oh oh oh
What's wrong with being, what's wrong with being
What's wrong with being confident? oh oh oh

45,Neon Lights,Natasha Bedingfield,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/natasha-bedingfield/neon-lights-chords-1081725,"Everyday theres a thousand things
that somehow pass us by
Go cut through the noise
So you can know what love sounds like
I'm comin' to your frequency
To 106 point me
So there's no
Distractions
Take a breath, take it in
Love has no expiration date
My heart will always beat 
for you at a constant rate
It will outlast everything
You think is set is stone
It goes on and on and on and on,
On and on and on and on...
Spastic like
Neon Lights
Can you feel my love?
Loud and clear
Pulls you near
Can you feel my love
We got all the memories
So much more we can see
Better than our first kiss
Snow falling at Christmas
Like sleeping in on Sunday
Laughter we never faked
Bob Marley in Summer
One love for each other
Fireflies
Day and night
Can you feel my love?
Everyone is looking for a special connection
But its like your compass points
A million directions
Do you need me to buy you
A telescope so you can see
How good
This could be
Spastic like
Neon Lights
Can you feel my love?
Loud and clear
Pulls you near
Can you feel my love
We got all the memories
So much more we can see
Better than our first kiss
Snow falling at Christmas
Like sleeping in on Sunday
Laughter we never faked
Bob Marley in Summer
One love for each other
Fireflies
Day and night
Can you feel my love?
And I'll wait for you
As long as it takes
Until I get through
And it hits you right in the face
Can you feel my lo-o-ove?
Can you feel my love?
We got all the memories
So much more we can see
Better than our first kiss
Snow falling at Christmas
Like sleeping in on Sunday
Laughter we never faked
Bob Marley in Summer
One love for each other
One love for each other  
Can you feel my love?
Spastic like  (fireflies)
Neon Lights   (day and night)
Can you feel my love?
Fireflies
Day and night
Can you feel my love?

0,Through The Dark,One Direction,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/one-direction/through-the-dark-chords-1433381,"You tell me that you're sad and lost your way.
You tell me that your tears are here to stay,
but I know you were only hiding
You tell me that you're hurt and you're in pain,
but I just wanna see you smile again
But don't burn out
Even if you scream and shout
It'll come back to you
and I'll be here for you
Oh I would carry you over
Fire and water for your love
And I would hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on ya
We will find a way through the dark
I wish that I could take you to the stars
I'd never let you fall and break your heart.
And if you want to cry or fall apart
I'll be there to hold you
You tell me that you heard it's all in vain,
but I can see your heart can love again
and I remember you laughing
so let's just laugh again
But don't burn out
Even if you scream and shout
It'll come back to you
Oh I would carry you over
Fire and water for your love
And I would hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on ya
We will find a way through the dark
and you don't need
you don't need to run
and you will see
it's easy to be loved
I know you wanna be loved
Oh I would carry you over
Fire and water for your love
Oh I would carry you over
Fire and water for you love
And I would hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on ya
We will find a way through the dark
Oh I would carry you over
Fire and water for your love
And I would hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on ya
We will find a way through the dark

1,Saturno,Pablo Alborán,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/2146527,"Vuelves, en cada sueño que tengo caigo de nuevo en tu red
Sé que tarda un tiempo curarme de ti de una vez...
Tuve tantos momentos felices que olvido lo triste que fue
Darte de mi alma, lo que tú echaste a perder
Yo no querí­a amarte, tú me enseñaste a odiarte
Todos los besos que me imaginé vuelven al lugar donde los vi crecer
En Saturno viven los hijos que nunca tuvimos
En Plutón aún se oyen gritos de amor
En la Luna gritan a solas tu voz y mi voz
Pidiendo perdón, cosa que nunca pudimos hacer peor
Tienes la misma culpa que tengo
Aunque te cueste admitir que sientes como siento
La almohada no suele mentir
Y yo no querí­a amarte, tú me enseñaste a odiarte
Todos los besos que me imaginé, vuelven al lugar donde los vi crecer
En Saturno viven los hijos que nunca tuvimos
En Plutón aún se oyen gritos de amor
En la Luna gritan a solas tu voz y mi voz
Pidiendo perdón, cosa que nunca pudimos hacer peor

Pidiendo perdon

Convince a crowd but don't have love

So let my life be the proof, The proof of Your love
Let my love look like You and what You're made of
How You lived, how You died Love is sacrifice

It seems all the poverty is found in me

Only love remains. Only love remains

Wish it wasn't a case of ""this time""

Someone that I would trust
But how did I fail
To give you all the love that you deserve?
When you're the only thing that's worth
What life is worth

Cause baby if I were you I would probably hate me too

So sure, so sure, so connected
To those little believers inside

But dreams are elusive
The kind we've gotten used to
Is nothing I can feel
Nothing I can have
Nothing that I know

I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize
I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
Come on little lady, give us a smile
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a Goddamn thing

And I'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe
I've been polite, but won't be caught dead
Lettin' a man tell me what I should do in my bed
Keep my exes in check in my basement

I could play nice or I could be a bully

Will come down in circles and guide me to love
I don't know what's right for me
I cannot see straight
I've been here too long and I don't wanna wait for it
Fly like a cannonball straight to my soul
Tear me to pieces and make me feel whole
I'm willing to fight for it
To feel something new
To know what it's like to be sharing a space with you
Fall on me
With open arms
Fall on me
From where you are
Fall on me
With all your light
With all your light
With all your light
Sooner or later, it all comes apart
The walls are all shattered, I'm back at the start
And I'm willing to follow this
Wherever it goes
The heart has its reasons that nobody knows
And I wanna believe in a world we can't see
Millions of particles passing through me
And I know there's a meaning
I feel it, I swear
I can't see the future, but I know that it's there
Fall on me
With open arms
Fall on me
From where you are
Fall on me
With all your light
With all your light
With all your light
     With all your light
I close my eyes
And I'm seeing you everywhere
I step outside
It's like I'm breathing you in the air
I can feel you're there

Fall on me
From where you are
Fall on me

 Avec nos bidons  en fer blanc
On descendait chercher  le lait
 A la ferme au  soleil couchant
Dans l'odeur des soirs de  juillet
 On avait l'âge des con-fitures
Des billes et des îles au trésor
 Et on allait  cueillir les mûres
En bas-- dans la ruelle des mo-orts
 On nous disait  que Barbe Rousse
Avait ici sa gar-nison
 Et que dans ce coin  de cambrousse
Il avait vaincu   des dragons
 On avait l'âge  de nos fêlures
Et on était conquistadors
 On déterrait  casques et fémurs
En bas    dans la ruelle des mo-orts
Dans la ruelle des mo-orts
 On arrosait  toutes nos victoires
A grands coups de verres de  kéfir
 Ivres de joie et  sans l'savoir
On reprenait Mers el-Kebir
 Puis c'étaient nos chars en  Dinky
Contre les tigres et do-ryphores
 Qui libéraient la  French County
En bas   dans la ruelle des mo-orts
 Que ne demeurent  les printemps
A l'heure des sorties de  l'école
 Quand les filles nous jouent leurs seize ans
Pour une bouif de Royale  Menthol
 Je n'sais plus si c'é-tait Françoise,
Martine, Claudine ou  Marie-Laure
 Qui nous f'saient goûter leurs framboises
En bas   dans la ruelle des mo-orts
Dans la ruelle des mo-orts
Dans la ruelle des mo-orts
 Que ne demeurent  les automnes
Quand sonne l'heure  de nos folies
 J'ai comme un bourdon qui  résonne
Au clocher de ma  nostalgie
 Les enfants cueillent  des immortelles
Des chrysanthèmes  des boutons d'or
 Les deuils se ramassent à la pelle
En bas   dans la ruelle des mo-orts
Dans la ruelle des mo-orts

Roads that go nowhere
  I know there's somewhere better
'Cause you always take me there
  Came to you with a broken faith

  Would you take the wheel
If I lose control?

Will you take me home?
Could you take care

The more you talk to me
  You rationalize my darkest thoughts

No one knows it's you Miss Jackson
Found another victim
But no one's ever gonna find Miss Jackson

You put a sour little flavor in my mouth now
You move in circles hoping no one's gonna find out
But we're so lucky,
Kiss the ring and let 'em bow down
Looking for the time of your life
A pretty picture but the scenery is so loud,
A face like heaven catching lighting in your nightgown,
But back away from the water, babe, you might drown-
The party isn't over tonight

Where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?

Reading that text you sent me again
Though I memorized it anyway
It was an afternoon in December
When it reminded you of the day
When we bumped into each other
But you didn't say hi cause I looked away
And maybe that was the biggest mistake of my life
And maybe I haven't moved on since that night
Cause it's 12:51 and I thought my feelings were gone
But I'm lying on my bed, thinking of you again
And the moon shines so bright, but I gotta dry these tears tonight
Cause you're moving on and I'm not that strong to hold on any longer
Oh Oh Oh Oh...
Then I saw you with her
Didn't think you'd find another
And the world just seemed to crash
Shouldn't have thought this would last
And maybe that was the biggest mistake of my life
And maybe I haven't moved on since that night
Cause it's 12:51 and I thought my feelings were gone
But I'm lying on my bed, thinking of you again
And the moon shines so bright, but I gotta dry these tears tonight
Cause you're moving on and I'm not that strong to hold on any longer
As the sky outside gets brighter
And my eyes begin to tire
I'm slowly drowning
And I know it shouldn't matter
As my heart begins to shatter
I'm left to wonder
12:51 and I thought my feelings were gone
But I'm lying on my bed, thinking of you again
And the moon shines so bright, but I gotta dry these tears tonight
Cause you're moving on and I'm not that strong to hold on
Cause I'll prove you wrong that I can move on through this song
So much stronger

He doesn't mind I have an LA crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart
Swimming pool glimmering darling
Watch me in the swimming pool bright blue ripples
You sit sippin' on your black Cristal, yeah
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Give me them gold coins, gimme them coins

Cuz he knows I'm wasted, facing
Because I'm crazy, baby I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet singing in the garden
Ready for you
My old man is a tough man but
And he shows me, he knows me
Every inch of my tar black soul
In fact he says he thinks it's why he might like about me
Admires me, the way I roll like a Rolling Stone
Likes to watch me in the glass room bathroom, Chateau Marmont
Glass room perfume Cognac lilac fume
Light of his life, fire of his loins
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me, gimme them coins

Cuz he knows I'm wasted, facing
Because I'm crazy, baby I need you to come here and save me

I can see your face is shameless, Cipriani's basement
God I'm so crazy, baby, I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet, Queen of Coney Island
Sorry 'bout it
My old man is a thief and I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
But I trust in the decision of the lord to watch over us
I'm not afraid to say that I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
They would rue the day I was alone without you
You're lying with your gold chain on, cigar hanging from your lips
I said ""Hon' you never looked so beautiful as you do now, my man.""
And we're off to the races, places
to Las Vegas pay us, Casino Oasis, honey it is time to spin

And I know I've said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night
Trying to tell you no, but my body keeps on telling you yes
Trying to tell you stop, but your lipstick got me so out of breath

And I'd be waking up, feeling satisfied but guilty as hell

A curious boy and they wonder
Where he came from

Still I feel, as if I’m a walking machine
Watching it all through a screen
There ain’t nothing in between to me
This might as well not be real”

It’s an Indigo night, there’s a chill
The boy is confused but he’s still
As they gather around him
So many of them, they all sing
About the pleasures of life
And he cries: “Why can’t I sing along with some feeling, or some meaning?
It feels like I’ve always been blind
I don’t know why you girls are so kind
For there are so many in line
Whose lives aren’t as lost as mine”
Oh oh oh oh oh no hm hm hm oh oh oh oh hm hm hm hm
Now something happened there
The smell of the grass, or maybe the air
There was no more despair
Just something about that night
Maybe the girls, they lit some light
And made everything right

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up

'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
  I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
  Chandelier still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not

I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright, they say, ""I don't know""

I see you everywhere, the only thing we share is this small town

But if the story's over, why am I still writing pages?

Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears at the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you too much but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts
  I get drunk, but it's not enough
   'Cause you're not my baby

Glass on the side I've
Been sat with you
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
I need you darling, come on set the tone
Oh oh oh, oh oh
If you love me come on get involved
Oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh,
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh- Sing!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
This love is a blaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
Let it go until the roads are changed
Singing we found love in a local rave- no
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
I told her my name, I said it's nice to meet ya
Then she handed me a bottle o' water filled with tequila
I already know she's a keeper
Deep if anybody finds out I'm meant to drive home
But I drunk all of it now, no
I'am not sobering up so
We just sit on the couch one thing led to another
I need you darling, come on set the tone
Oh oh oh, oh oh
If you love me come on get involved
Oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh,
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh- Sing!
Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Found you hiding here so hoped you take my hand, darlin'

 Walking towards the airport leaving us all in your past
 I traveled fifteen hundred miles to see you
 Begged you to want me
 But you didn’t want to
 But piece by piece he collected me
 Up off the ground where you abandon things
 And piece by piece he filled the holes that you burned in me
 He never walks away
 He takes care of me
 Piece by piece
 That a man can be kind
 And a father could stay
 And all of your words fall flat
 I made something of myself and now you wanna come back
 But your love it isn’t free
 It has to be earned
 Back then I didn’t have anything you needed
 So I was worthless
 But piece by piece he collected me

You left with no goodbye 
Not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any sins
I had no idea of the state we were in
I know I have a fickle heart
And a bitterness
And a wandering eye
And a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me          before
Baby please remember me     once more
When was the last time that you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memory?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do     the less I know
I know I have a fickle heart
And a bitterness
And a wandering eye
And a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember?
Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me          before
Baby please remember me     once more
Gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
In hope that you'd find the missing piece
To bring you back to me

Don't you remember?
The reason you loved me          before
Baby please remember  me     once more

Reminding the broken it'll be alright
But right now, oh right now I just can't

When there's nothing to bring me down
But what will I say
When I'm held to the flame
Like I am right now
I know You're able and I know You can
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone
They say it only takes a little faith
To move a mountain
Well good thing
A little faith is all I have, right now
But God, when You choose
To leave mountains unmovable
Oh give me the strength to be able to sing
It is well with my soul
I know You're able and I know You can
Save through the fire with Your mighty hand

Left to be a rock and roll star
He told me please don't worry
Wise little smile that spoke so safely
He booked a one way ticket
Out west that's where they make it
Six kids stuck in a bedsit
To sunswept poolside riches
He met a girl who wore Versace
Pink feather coats and jumbo jewelry
Gonna be a hoop phenomenon
He's gonna be Hakeem Olajuwan
He's got a gold Camaro
He said over the payphone
I try to keep my cool but
My life turns in slow motion
Bye bye baby blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush it's killing you
Screaming at the sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run
I settle for a ghost I never knew
Super paradise I held on to
But I settle for a ghost
When I was from n.o.l.a no one
Left to be a rock and roll star
He'd stay and treat his lady
Give everything to his new baby
I miss him don't you blame me
That boy went stone cold crazy
Caught up in camera lust he's
Chasing that pappy pipe dreams
I know you don't but I
I know you don't but I still try
My thunder came and shook him down
That girl is gone but I still try
The bullet hit but maybe not
It hits my head and I feel numb
My body's looking wrong
Bye bye baby blue
I wish you could see the wicked truth
Caught up in a rush it's killing you
Screaming at the sun you blow into
Curled up in a grip when we were us
Fingers in a fist like you might run

Even when I'm acting crazy
Tell me everything's alright
Dear future husband,
Here's a few things
You'll need to know if you want to be
My one and only all my life
Dear future husband,
If you wanna get that special loving
Tell me I'm beautiful each and every night
Future husband, better love me right

See you walking 'round like it's a funeral
Not so serious, girl; why those feet cold?
We just getting started; don't you tiptoe, tiptoe,   ah
 Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece
 You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me, ah
 You're a real-life fantasy, you're a real-life fantasy
But you're moving so carefully; let's start living dangerously
Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk for me, baby
I'll be Diddy,  you'll be Naomi, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
God damn
See you licking frosting from your own hands
Want another taste, I'm begging, yes ma'am
I'm tired of all this candy on the dry land, dry land, oh
 Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece
 You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me, ah
 You're a real-life fantasy, you're a real-life fantasy
But you're moving so carefully; let's start living dangerously
Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk for me, baby
I'll be Diddy,  you'll be Naomi, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
oooooh ah ah
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
oooooh ah ah
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
       You're fucking delicious,
       Talk to me girl
Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go fucking crazy
I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk for me, baby

I-I-I-I-I-I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
  Red velvet, vanilla, 
Chocolate in my life
Funfetti, I'm ready;
I need it every night
Red velvet, vanilla, 
Chocolate in my life (I-I-I-I-I)
I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean

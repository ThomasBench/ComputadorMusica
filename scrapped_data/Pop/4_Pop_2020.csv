Abandon myself daily
I am afraid to let you see the real me

And the rain it falls, rain it falls

Only if you knew, how much I liked you
But I watch your eyes as she
Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes, brighter
than a blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die
Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better
(Wish I were Heather)
Watch as she stands with her, holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder
But how could I hate her? She's such an angel
But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she

Two weeks and I wait 'til the feeling hits
Maybe I just haven't let it sink in
For three years we were living together
Held me like you'd hold me forever
Didn't think that heartbreak would feel like this
From everything to nothing at all
From every day to never at all
And everyone says that I should be sad
Is it normal that—
I don't feel sorry for myself
Care if your hands touch somebody else
Wouldn't get jealous if you're happy
It's okay if you forget me
I don't feel empty now that you're gone
Does that mean it didn't mean nothing at all?
But I'll tell you what the worst is
When I wish it did
Patience is the thing that I learnt from you
That some things can feel wrong even though they're true
Went through all the hard times together
Kept me calm when I'd lose my temper
I'm just really grateful that I had you
From everything to nothing at all
Every day to never at all
And everyone says that I should be sad
Is it normal that—
I don't feel sorry for myself
Care if your hands touch somebody else
Wouldn't get jealous if you're happy
It's okay if you forget me

Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared

I wasn't born a renegade
I felt alone, still feel afraid
I stumbled through it anyway
I wish someone would have told me that this life is ours to choose
No one's handing you the keys or a book with all the rules
The little that I know I'll tell to you
When they dress you up in lies and you're left naked with the truth
You threw your head back, and you spit in the wind
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in
Let 'em drag you through hell, they can't tell you to change who you are
And when the storm's out, you run in the rain
Put your sword down, dive right into the pain
Stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars
That's all I know so far
So you might give yourself away, yeah
And pay full price for each mistake
But when the candy-coating hides the razor blade
You can cut yourself loose and use that rage
I wish someone would have told me that this darkness comes and goes
People will pretend but baby girl, nobody knows
And even I can't teach you how to fly
But I can show you have to live like your life is on the line
You threw your head back, and you spit in the wind
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in
Let 'em drag you through hell, they can't tell you to change who you are
And when the storm's out, you run in the rain
Put your sword down, dive right into the pain
Stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars

That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far
I will be with you 'til the world blows up, yes
Up and down and through 'til the world blows up, yeah
When it's right or it's all fucked up, 'til the world blows up, 'til the world blows up
And we will be enough and until the world blows up
Just throw your head back, and spit in the wind
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in
Let 'em drag you through hell, they can't tell you to change who you are

Put your sword down, dive right into the pain

It's back and forth, did I do something wrong?
It's back and forth, maybe this is all your fault instead

That I was the only girl you'd ever want in your life

Each day goes by and each night, I cry
Somebody saw you with her last night
You gave me your word, ""Don't worry 'bout her""
You might love her now, but you loved me first
Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are
Oh, you swore on every star
How could you be so reckless with my heart?
You check in and out
Of my heart like a hotel
And she must be perfect, oh well
I hope you both go to hell

Go, go, go! But every moment you're here with me
I lost the confidence in who I was
To busy tryna chase the high and get the numbers up
I have the same dream every night
A bullet through my brain the moment that I close my eyes
I still have to lean on a shoulder when I've broken down
And I have people that depend on me to sort them out
I sometimes fantasise I disappear without a trace
I have no regrets, but wish I did things in a different way
Low fly zone, lawsuits, and film stars
Headline wrote the princess and the face scar
Broken bones, break-ins, and Babylon
Go, go, go! But every moment you're here with me
And life, life is changin' tides
Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will

I remember you and me
Yeah, I remember everything

And everybody's tellin' me to act my age

We didn't know how it would be
We were the dumb, the wild, the free

Get another chance, take it back in time
'Cause I don't know what to do
With everything I'm goin' through
And where did all my friends go?
Standin' on our street, but nobody's home
Swore we'd never move away

Même devenir amis, même conduire dans Paris
Faut pas faire des études pour être au courant
Que comme t'étais du sud, tu prenais ton temps

Ain't a doubleheader if you lose your head
Try the medication that I bought instead
It's workin' for a little, but there's not much left
Darling, don't you weep
There's a place for me
Somewhere we can sleep
See you in your dreams
Ever since a little girl, I found it sweet
Drivin' past a graveyard on a lonesome street
All the little flowers gave me somethin' to believe in
Never knew the feelin' of a stable home
Been a couple years of livin' on the road
Couldn't really tell you where they'd leave a stone
To visit me when I am dead and gone

There's a place for me

But only you have shown me how to love bein' alive
Until it's time to see the light
I'll make my own with you each night
I'll kidnap all the stars and I will keep them in your eyes
I'll wrap them up in velvet twine
And hang 'em from a fishin' line
So I can see them anytime I like

But still, they're washin' cars and they don't show any age
Ain't nothing that you'd wanna cost you more than time
If you're tryna find yourself, better get in line
I counted up my money and spendin' to get it right
Got the future in my pocket, I'm spendin' it all a night
Like a prophet with the vision, I finally see the light
And you know
I've been dreaming about the West Coast (I've been dreaming)
Found some places that I don't know (I've been dreaming about)
I see your signs for California
Change the shade for something warmer
I've been dreaming about the West Coast (I've been dreaming)
Where the people take you real slow (I've been dreaming about)
I need the sun for just a year
I'll kiss the sky and disappear
The West Coast
Glitter nights under starry skies
All I wanna do is fly
Take me where the sun shines  brighter
I've been dreaming about the West Coast
Time to find myself a new cloth
I need the sun for just a year
I'll kiss the sky and disappear
I've been dreaming about the West Coast (I've been dreaming)
Found some places that I don't know (I've been dreaming about)
I see your signs for California
Change the shade for something warmer
I've been dreaming about the West Coast (I've been dreaming)
Where the people take you real slow (I've been dreaming about)

Get on up, baby, dance to the rhythm of the music
Don’t care what the DJ chooses 
Get lost in the rhythm of me

Will get up, up on the dancefloor, move it’s a Saturday night
I fell in love with the sparkle in the moonlight
Reflected in your beautiful eyes, I guess that is destiny doing it right
And just like they do in the Mediterranean
spin you around me again and again and
You’re like something that God has sent me
I want you baby, solamente

She runs away

She'll call him mine

Face to face
And one day
He'll look into her eyes

I was still bein' ignored (Lyin' for attention, just to get neglection)

 Just keep me employed now

   It's hard to stop it once it starts (It starts)
I'm not sentimental
But there's somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight,       mmm
Makes me wanna take a picture
Make a movie with you that we'd have to hide
You better lock your phone (Oh)
And look at me whеn you're alone
Won't take a lot to gеt you goin' (Oh)
I'm sorry if it's torture though, I know, I know
It might be more of an obsession
  You really make a strong impression (You sure do)
    Nobody saw me in the lobby (Saw me in the lobby)
   Nobody saw me in your arms, mmm
I'm not sentimental
But there's somethin' 'bout the way you look tonight, ('Bout the way you look tonight), mmm
Makes me wanna make 'em jealous
I'm the only one who does it how you like (Only one who does it how you—)
You better lock your phone (Oh)
And look at me whеn you're alone  (You're alone, you're alone)
Won't take a lot to gеt you goin' (Get me goin', get me goin')
I'm sorry if it's torture though, (Torture though), I know, I know
You better lock your door  (Oh)
And look at me a little more
   We both know I'm worth waitin' for (Waitin' for)
That heavy breathin' on the floor (On the floor)
I'm yours, I'm yours (I'm yours)
I'm not sentimental
I'm not sentimental
I'm not sentimental
I can't seem to focus
And you don't seem to notice
I'm not here
I'm just a mirror
You check your complexion
to find your reflection
Is all alone
I had to go
Can't you hear me
I'm not coming home
Do you understand
I've changed my plans
Cause I'm in love
With my future
Can't wait to meet her
And I,
I'm in love
But not with anybody else
Just wanna get to know myself
  I know supposedly I'm lonely now (Lonely now)
  Know I'm supposed to be unhappy without (Someone)
Someone but aren't I someone? (Aren't I someone? Yeah)
I
Like to be your answer (Be your answer)
Cause you're so handsome (You're so handsome)
But I know better
Than to drive you home
Cause you'd invite me in
And I'd be yours again
But I, I'm in love (Love, love, love, love)
With my future
And you don't know her
And I, I'm in love (Love, love)
But not with anybody here
I'll see you in a couple years
Can't take it back once it's been set in motion
You know I love to rub it in like lotion
  If you only  pray on Sunday
  Could you come my way on Monday?
  'Cause I like to do things God doesn't approve of if she saw us
She couldn't look away, look away, look away
She'd wanna get involved, involved, involved
And what would people say, people say, people say
If they listen through the wall, the wall, the wall?
   I can see it clear as day
   You don't really need to pray
   Wanna see what you can take
   You should really run away
  I wanna do bad things to you (To you)
  I wanna make you yell (Yell)
  I wanna do bad things to you (To you)
  Don't wanna treat you well (Well)
Can't take it back once it's been set in motion
You know I need you for the Oxytocin
  If you find it hard to swallow
  I can loosin' up your collar
 'Cause as long as you're still breathing
  Don't you even think of leaving
Not gonna wanna look away, look away, look away
kinda wanna get involved, involved, involved
And what would people say, people say, people say
If they listen through the wall, the wall, the wall?
   I can see it clear as day
   You don't really need to pray
   Wanna see what you can take
   You should really run away
  Other people would have stayed
  Other people don't obey
  You and me are both the same
   You should really run away
Bad things
  I wanna do bad things to you (To you)
  I wanna make you yell (Yell)
  I wanna do bad things to you (To you)
  Don't wanna treat you well (Well)
""He hath come to the bosom of his beloved
Smiling on him, she beareth him to highest heav'n
With yearning heart""
""On thee we gaze, O' gold-wing'd messenger of mighty Gods""
Gold-winged (X16)
Gold-winged angel
Go home, don't tell
Anyone what you are
You're sacred and they're starved
And their art is gettin' dark
And there you are to tear apart
Tear apart, tear apart, tear apart
You better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
  Better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
They're gonna tell you what you wanna hear
Then they're gonna disappear
Gonna claim you like a souvenir
Just to sell you in a year
  You better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
  Better keep your head down-down (Down)
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
  You better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
  Better keep your head down-down
Da-da-down-down, da-da-down-down
  That's good
Somethin' in the...
Somethin' in the air right now
Like I'm losin' track of time (Time, time)
Like I don't really care right now
But maybe that's fine
You weren't even there that day
I was waitin on you (You, you)
I wonder if you aware away that day
Was the last straw for me
And I know I sent you flowers (Know, know)
Did you even care?
You ran the shower
And left them by the stairs
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy, uhh
 Thought you had your shit together, but damn I was wrong
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (Cause, cause)
And this ain't nothin' like it once was (Was, was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job (Job)
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (Cause, cause)
And this ain't nothin' like it once was (Was, was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw
 I used to think you werе shy (shy)
Or maybe you just had nothing on your mind
Maybe you were thinkin' 'bout yourself all the time (time)
I used to wish you were mine (mine)
But that was way before I realized
Someone like you would always be so easy to find
(Um, um, so) So easy (easy, so, easy)
Easy, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
 Gave me no flowers
Wish I didn't care
You'd been gone for hours
Could be anywhere (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I thought you would've grown eventually
But you proved me wrong
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause
And this ain't nothin' like it once was
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause
And this ain't nothin' like it once was
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job
 What did I tell you?
Don't get complacent
It's time to face it now
 What did I tell you?
Don't get complacent
It's time to face it now
I don't want it
And I don't want to want you
But in my dreams, I seem to be more honest
   And I must admit you've been in quite a few
Halley's Comet
Comes around more than I do
But you're all it takes for me to break a promise
       Silly me to fall in love with you
I haven't slept since Sunday
Midnight for me is 3AM for you
But my sleepless nights are better
With you the nights could never be alone, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
I was good at feeling nothin', now I'm hopeless
What a drag to love you like I do, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I've been loved before, but right now in this moment
I feel more and more likе I was made for you
     For you
I'm sitting in my brother's room
  Haven't slеpt in a week, or two, or two
I think I might have fallen in love
What am I to do?
   Do you know me?
     Really know me?
    You have opinions about my opinions
About my music
   About my body
Some people hate what I wear
Some people use it to shame others
But I feel you watching
And nothing I do goes unseen
So while I feel your stares, your disapproval or your sigh of relief
Would you like me to be smaller, weaker, softer, taller?
Would you like me to be quiet?
Am I my stomach? My hips?
Is it not what you wanted?
If I wear what is comfortable, I am not a woman
If I shed the layers, I'm a slut
Though you've never seen my body, you still judge it
   We make assumptions about people based on their size
We decide who they are
If I wear more, if I wear less
Is my value based only on your perception?
I don't really even know how it happened
I started talkin', they started laughin'
I don't really even know how it happened
I started watchin' them photographin'
I don't really (I don't really) how it happened
Instead of stoppin', they still were flashin' (I don't really)
I started walkin' (I don't really), gave no reaction (No reaction)
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't un-relievе it
I'm overheated, can't bе defeated
Can't be deleted, can't be repeated
I'm overheated
I'm overheated
I don't really wanna know why you went there (Why you went there)
I kinda don't care (Kinda don't care)
You wanna kill me (You wanna kill me)
You wanna hurt me (Mmm)
Stop bein' flirty (He-he-he)
It's kinda workin'
Did you really think this is the right thing to do? (Is it news? News to who?)
That I really looked just like the rest of you
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't un-relievе it
I'm overheated, can't bе defeated
Can't be deleted, can't be repeated
I'm overheated
And everybody said it was a let down
I was only built like everybody else now
But I didn't get a surgery to help out
'Cause I'm not about to redesign myself now, am I?   Am I? (Am I?) Am I? (Am I?)
All these other inanimate bitches
It's none of my business
But don't you get sick of
Posin' for pictures with that plastic body? Man
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't un-relievе it
I'm overheated, can't bе defeated
Can't be deleted, can't be repeated
I'm overheated
I'm overheated
Everybody dies, surprise, surprise
We tell each other lies, sometimes, we try
To make it feel like we might be right
We might not be alone
Be alone
""Everybody dies,"" that's what they say
And maybe, in a couple hundred years, they'll find another way
I just wonder why you'd wanna stay
If everybody goes
You'd still be alone
I don't wanna cry, some days I do
But not about you
It's just a lot to think about
The world I'm used to
The one I can't get back, at lеast not for a while
I sure have a knack for seein' lifе more like a child
It's not my fault, it's not so wrong to wonder why
Everybody dies, and when will I?
You oughta know
That even when it's time, you might not wanna go
But it's okay to cry and it's alright to fold
But you are not alone
You are not unknown
    Try not to abuse your power
    I know we didn't choose to change
    You might not want to lose your power
     But having it's so strange
She said you were a hero, you played the part
But you ruined her in a year, don't act like it was hard
And you swear you didn't know (didn't know, didn't know)
No wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleeping in your clothes (in your clothes)
But now she's got to get to class
   And how could you
Will you only feel bad when they find out
If you could take it all back
    Try not to abuse your power
    I know we didn't choose to change
    You might not want to lose your power
     But having it's so strange
I thought that I was special
You made me feel like it was my fault
You were the devil, lost your appeal
Does it keep you in control (in control)
For you to keep her in a cage
And you swear you didn't know (didn't know)
You said you thought she was your age
   And how could you?
Will you only feel bad if it turns out, that they kill your contract
    Try not to abuse your power
    I know we didn't choose to change
    You might not want to lose your power
     But power isn't pain
Did you think I'd show up in a limousine? (No)
Had to save my money for security
Got a stalker walkin' up and down the street
Says he's Satan and he'd like to meet
I bought a secret house when I was seventeen
Haven't had a party since I got the keys
Had a pretty boy over, but he couldn't stay
On his way out I made him sign an NDA, mm
 Yeah, I made him sign an NDA
Once is good enough
'Cause I don't want him having shit to say-ay, ayy, ayy, ayy-ayy
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave it, but you don't need to know, oh-oh, oh
Thirty under thirty for another year (Another year)
I can barely go outside, I think I hate it herе (Think I hate it here)
Maybе I should think about a new career
Somewhere in Kuwait where I can disappear
I been havin' fun (Fun, fun, fun) gettin' older now
Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth
At least I gave him something he can cry about
I thought about my future, but I want it now, oh-oh
Want it now, mm-mm-mm
You can't keep me up
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave it, but you don't need to know, oh-oh, oh
Did I take it too far? (Did I take it too far?)
Now I know what you are (Are)
And it's so hard (It's so hard)
I saw stars
Think I took it too far (Too far)
When I sold you my heart (My heart)
How'd it get so dark? (So dark)
I saw stars (I saw stars)
Stars (Stars)
I'm not your friend or anything
Damn, you think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend or anything
Damn, you think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
What the hell are you talking about
Get my pretty name outta your mouth
We are not the same with or without
'bout me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal
I'm not your friend or anything
Damn, you think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend or anything
Damn, you think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I don't want press to put your name next to mine
Wanna be nice enough
  Articles, articles, articles
(Got a lotta) Interviews, interviews, interviews
I'm not your friend or anything
Damn, you think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend or anything
Damn, you think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name
I'm sorry
I don't think I caught your name
I'm not your friend or anything
Damn, you think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend or anything
Damn, you think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true, mmm
Give me a day or two
To think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do,  mm-mm
  Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly weren't aware that you made me miserable, ooh
So if you really wanna know
When I'm away from you (When I'm away from you)
I'm happier than ever (I'm happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)
I wish it wasn't true, mmm
You called me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut them all out for you 'cause I was a kid
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone
    Home alone, tryin' not to eat
  Distract myself with pornography
     I hate the way she looks at me
I can't stand the dialogue, she would never be
 That satisfied, it's a male fantasy
    I'm goin' back to therapy
'Cause I loved you then, and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm gett---ing  ov---er  you
Or just pre---tend---ing  to
Be   al----right, con---vince my--self I  hate you
     I got a call from a girl I used to know
  We were inseparablе years ago
     Thought we'd get along, but it wasn't so
     And it's all I think about whеn I'm behind the wheel
  I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel
     But nothing lasts, I know the deal
'Cause I loved you then, and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm gett---ing  ov---er  you
Or just pre---tend---ing  to
Be   al----right, con---vince my--self I  hate you
Can't get   ov--er  you
No mat--ter what  I   do
I know  I   should, but  I could nev-er hate you

With their masks off and it makes me so happy
   Larchmont Village smells like lilies of the valley
And the bookstore doors are opening
And it's finally happening
Ever since I fell out of love with you I fell back in love with me
And, boy, does it feel sweet
Ever since I fell out of love with you I fell back in love with the city
Like thе Paramount sign sparkling
   Sparkling just for me
You made me tradе my violets for roses
You tried to trade in my new truck for horses
Don't forget all of these things that you love are the same things I hate
  A simple life, I chose this
You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to take all the pink off my toes, and
God knows the only mistake that a man can make
Is tryna make a woman change and trade her violets for roses
Trade her violets for roses
Ah-la-ha, ah-ha
  There's something in the air
I hope it doesn't change, that it's for real
The beginning of something big happening
And by the murder alleys
In the streets have ceased
And still the shadows haunt the avenue
The silence is deafening
Ever since I fell out of love with you I fell back in love with the streets
And, God, does it feel sweet
Ever since I fell out of love with you I breakdance to the backbeat
And, God, does it sound sweet
Like it's playing just for me

You tried to trade in my new truck for horses

Driven to hospitals with broken bones
We've shared a toothbrush and shared our home

Been up at 5AM, watchin' the sunrise

I'd dive deeper for you
What a blessing to feel your love
Twilight moments with you
I’ve been asleep so long, I'm so far away
Visions I see are strong, I hear what they say
Won't you leave all your fears at the edge of the world?
I’ll tell you again like I told you before
I've been asleep so long, wasting away
Tell me, would you pack up all your bags, stay true to North?
You're the only one I'd do this for
Red, red desert, heal our blues
I'd dive deeper for you
What a blessing to feel your love
Twilight moments with you
It doesn't take too long (Ah) to heal and replace (Ah)
The demons we're running from (Ah), they're begging to stay
Tell me, would you pack up all your bags, stay true to North?
You’re the only one I’d do this for
Red, red desert, heal our blues

What a blessing to feel your love
Twilight moments with you

Like I'm watching a sequel I've already seen
I could tell you what happens to the new king
When he goes out of fashion
I want my money back now
Been running in the wrong crowd
I'd never say it out loud
But I've hated every word that comes out of your mouth
What should we fight about this time
What will they write about this time
It doesn't matter if you're not fine
You should've kept that shit offline
It feels a little medieval if you ask me
Like I'm watching a sequel I've already seen
And I could tell you what happens to the new king
When he goes out of fashion
It feels a little medieval kissing the ring
In a gothic cathedral, have you ever seen
What really happens to people like me
When we go out of fashion?
Don't put your weapons down
Don't go to heaven in a crown
It's not worth the money bringing me back from the dead
I never said it would be any fun
You never should've trusted anyone
They love you till you give 'em some
And then it's off with his head
It feels a little medieval kissing the ring
In a gothic cathedral, have you ever seen
What really happens to people like me
When we go out of fashion?
It feels a little medieval if you ask me

Cuando te necesitaba
Cuando más falta hacía
  Tú me diste la espalda
Tú me dejaste de querer
Cuando menos lo esperaba
Cuando más te quería
  Se te fueron las ganas
Yo me creía que era el más cabrón
Pero me estoy notando el corazón
Estás apretando mucho mami déjalo
Si quieres te doy la razón
Yo lo único que quiero es largarme de aquí
Me da igual dónde, puedes elegir
Algún día dentro de poco me voy a arrepentir
De haberte confesado lo que me haces sufrir
Tú me dejaste de querer
Cuando menos lo esperaba
Cuando más te quería
  Se te fueron las ganas
De punta en blanco para ir a tu fiesta
He pasado tres días con la misma ropa puesta
Loco por ti, perdiendo apuestas
Dime en quién piensas cuando te acuestas
Porque yo pienso en ti, son ilusiones
Yo pienso en ti, son ilusiones
Porque yo pienso en ti, son ilusiones
Yo pienso en ti, son ilusiones

Cuando más falta hacía

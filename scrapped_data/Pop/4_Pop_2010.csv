0,The Book Of Love,Peter Gabriel,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/peter-gabriel/the-book-of-love-chords-142629,"The book of love is long and boring
No one can lift the damn thing
It's full of charts and facts and figures
and instructions for dancing
But I 
I love it when you read to me
And you 
You can read me anything
The book of love has music in it
In fact that's where music comes from
Some of it is just transcendental
Some of it is just really dumb
But I        
I love it when you sing to me
And you  
You can sing me anything
The book of love is long and boring
And written very long ago
It's full of flowers and heart-shaped boxes
And things we're all too young to know
But I        
I love it when you give me things
And you          
You ought to give me wedding rings
And I       
I love it when you give me things
And you          
You ought to give me wedding rings
And I      
I love it when you give me things
And you          
You ought to give me wedding rings

 I just want to know you better know, you better know you, better now
 I just want to know you better know, you better know, you better now
 I just want to know you better know, you better know, you better now
 I just want to know you, know you, know you

And your eyes look like coming home 
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours 
All I know since yesterday, is everything has changed
And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
But I'll take them down, take them down 
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies 
 The beautiful kind, making up for lost time 
Taking flight, making me feel like
 I just want to know you better know, you better know you, better now
 I just want to know you better know, you better know, you better now
 I just want to know you better know, you better know, you better now
 I just want to know you, know you, know you

You'll be mine and I'll be yours 
All I know since yesterday, is everything has changed

I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
Ahhh And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
And I chase it down, with a shot of truth
Dancing through our house with the ghost of you
Cleaning up today, found that old Zepplin shirt
You wore when you ran away, and no one could feel your hurt

Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm wanna see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand

We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar

They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Your name
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames

If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby

Inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender
But this is not the end
I can't work it out
How?
Going through the motions
Going through us
And oh I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes all my words
Are all over written on the signs
But you're on my road walking me home
  See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, nooo
Easy baby maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my-y stomach
I messed up this time
Late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling
No-ow
We're going through the motions
Hopin' you'd stop
And oh I've only caused you pain
I know but all of my words
Will always below
Although all the lie we spoke
When you're on my road walking me home
  See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, nooo
Easy baby maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my-y stomach

No limits she craves 
Attention, she praises 
She prays to be 
Sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see 
The light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain 
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry 
But there's a hope 
That's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful 
Just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing

An envy, so she's

""Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""

She don't see her perfect, 
She don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface

Help you see a little bit clearer

They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby now you do
Singing in the old bars
Swinging with the old stars
Living for the fame
Kissing in the blue dark
Playing pool and wild darts
Video games
He holds me in his big arms
Drunk and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of
Watching all our friends fall
In and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playing video games
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
Honey, is that true?

I got a heart and I got a soul
Believe me I will use them both
We made a start
Be it a false one, I know
Baby, I don’t want to feel alone
So kiss me where I lay down, my hands press to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were 18 (18,18)
Long before we both thought the same thing  (same thing)
To be loved, to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you, oho-oho
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were 18
We took a chance   ('chance' will NEVER EVER be changed to 'chonce'!! It's his accent!)
God knows we tried
Yet all along, I knew we’d be fine
So pour me a drink, oh love
Let’s split the night wide open and we’ll see everything we can 
Live in love and slow motion, motion, motion
So kiss me where I lay down, my hands press to your cheeks
A long way from the playground

You took me back in time to when I was unbroken

And I knew it from the very first moment
Cause a light came on when I heard that song
And I want you to sing it again
I swear that every word you sing
You wrote them for me
Like it was a private show
But I know you never saw me
When the lights come on and I'm on my own
Will you be there to sing it again
Could I be the one you talk about in all your stories
Can I be him

  I get home I got the munchies
Binge on all my Twinkies
Throw up in the tub then I go to sleep

Tasted kind of lonely

Il vit mais parle à peine
Il l'attend

Il n'est pas fou
Il y croit c'est tout

Il l'attend debout
Une rose à la main
A, à part elle il n'attend rien
Rien autour n'a de sens et l'air est lourd
Le regard absent
Il est seul, et lui parle souvent, il
Il n'est pas fou
Il l'aime c'est tout
Il la voit partout
Il l'attend debout,
Debout, une rose à la main

Promets-moi que tout ira bien
Serre-moi fort

oui je veux rester
Mais je ne sais plus aimer
J'ai été trop bête
Je t'en prie arrête, arrête
Comme je regrette
Non  Je ne voulais pas tout ça
Je serai riche et
Je t'offrirai tout mon or
Si tu t'en fiches je,
Je t'attendrai sur le bord
Si tu m'ignores je
T'offrirai mon dernier souffle de vie

peut illuminer la nuit
Un sourire 
peut bâtir tout un empire
Et il y a toi
Et il y a moi

Et si tu m'ignores je me battrai encore et encore

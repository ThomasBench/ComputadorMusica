Trust me I adore you
We’re swimming through our dreams
Kiss me in the shower
For a couple hours
Though we’re only sixteen
And sit down beside me
Don’t call me daddy
Cause that’s just fucking weird
Promise that you'll stay here
You and I can lay here
Until the end of time
But girl, well don't you worry about me
It ain’t new to me, feeling this lonely -Darling-
Girl, don't worry about me
But if you’re ever unhappy
Then maybe, baby, I must let you go
              Let you go
Baby now it’s best here,
to lay me down and rest here
Let’s dream of Corduroy
Work for what you love to do
and I will watch right over you
With your heart I’ll never toy
And you’re the other half of me.
Dream and sleep and laugh with me
Take me from myself
See I’m a fucking basket-case.
Until I'm able to see your face
You saved me from myself
But girl, well don't you worry about me
It ain’t new to me, feeling this lonely -Darling-
Girl, don't worry about me
But if you’re ever unhappy
Then maybe, baby, I must let you go

2,Ainutlaatuinen,Johanna Kurkela,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/johanna-kurkela/ainutlaatuinen-chords-1193226,"  Missähän sut tehtiin?
Tähtien tuolla puolella
muovailtiin huolella
Ethän sä ikinä
kadota tuota katsetta?
Mitähän sä vielä kantaa voit
korkealla kun noin sä soit
Ei mitään tuu niin painavaa
et se sinut musertaa
Kaunis pieni ihminen
Sä olet ainutlaatuinen
Mitä vastaan tuleekaan,
toista sua ei milloinkaan
Keskellä ihmettä 
Sen tajuu vasta jälkeenpäin
Taidat aavistaa jo sen
Yksin täytyy jokaisen
polku mennä pimeään
että pystyy elämään
Kaunis pieni ihminen
Sä olet ainutlaatuinen
Mitä vastaan tuleekaan,
toista sua ei milloinkaan
Sä saatat selvitä
vähin vammoin matkalla
Ystäväsi huolehtii
kun askelees on hatarat
Elämässä pitää kii
jos sen päältä putoat 
Kaunis pieni ihminen
Sä olet ainutlaatuinen
Mitä vastaan tuleekaan,
toista sua ei milloinkaan
Sä olet ainutlaatuinen

toista sua ei milloinkaan

Grandma and grandpa painted a picture
Of 65 years in one little house
More than a memory
More than saying I do
Kiss you goodnights
And I love you’s
Me and you baby
We’ll walk in their footsteps
We’ll build our own family
One day at a time
10 little toes
A painted pink room
Our beautiful baby looks just like you
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
Now til forever it’s all of me, all of you
Just take my hand and I’ll be the man your dad hoped that I’d be
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I’ll stand through the good and the bad
We’ll give all that we have
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
This life will go by in the blink of an eye
But I wouldn’t wanna spend it without you by my side
The clouds are gonna roll
The earth’s gonna shake
But I’ll be your shelter
Through the wind and the rain
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
Now til forever it’s all of me, all of you
Just take my hand and I’ll be the man your dad hoped that I’d be
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I’ll stand through the good and the bad
We’ll give all that we have
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
Someday we’ll wake up with thousands of pictures
Of 65 years in this little house
I won’t trade for nothin’ the life that we built
I’ll kiss you goodnight and say I love you still
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I’ll stand through the good and the bad

Think you had the last laugh

Think that I'd come running back

Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter

Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all fadeing
And that heaven is overrated
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?
Now that he’s back from that soul vacation
Chasing his way through the constellation, hey, hey
He checks out Mozart while he does tae-bo
Reminds me that there’s room to grow, hey, hey

I’m afraid that he might think of me as plain ol’ Jane
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance alone in the light of day?
And head back to the Milky Way
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
Did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?

Dark and lonely

I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his bell tower, hotel

Dans tout ce que je fais
La rage et l’amour s’embrassent
Qu’elle soit mienne ou qu’elle soit votre
La vie nous dépasse
Qué vendrá qué vendrá
Yo escribo mi camino
Sin pensar sin pensar
Dónde acabará
Dans mes joies, dans mes peines, dans mes choix, dans mes larmes
Je laisse aller mes sentiments
Au mieux on écrit son chemin comme on se soigne
Pour aimer indifféremment
Sur les sables mouvants d’un passé qui s’effondre
Je me raccroche à ceux que j’aime
Prenant soin de chaque seconde
Les heures prendront soin d’elles-mêmes
Qué vendrá qué vendrá
Yo escribo mi camino
Sin pensar sin pensar
Dónde acabará
Qué vendrá qué vendrá
Yo escribo mi camino
Si me pierdo es que ya me he encontrado
Y sé que debo continuar
 Puisque nous sommes ici sans savoir
Ce qui nous attend un peu plus tard
Laisser parler mon instinct me guérit
 Puisque tout cela est bien trop court
J’aimerai jusqu’à mon dernier jour
Jusqu’à mon dernier souffle de vie
Qué vendrá qué vendrá
Jusqu’où j’irai j’en sais rien

In every mouth there's a word of forgiveness
That melts all the ice to the ground
Why do you sigh?

Why does the sky  fall  down
Like  pour-ing rain?
To let it flow again
Gonna make you feel alright
Take your dreams, keep them out of sight
Wanna make you come alive
Close your eyes, keep you warm at night
So come a little closer to me
So many things I want you to see

In every laugh is the sorrow
Of all of the tears that you've held for so long
Would you make me cry?
Oh, let me run dry
In every tear are the eyes of a father
And mother that brought you to see
Sing lullaby
As you say goodnight, night, night (goodnight)
Why do the stars look  down (1 2 3 4 5   6 7 8 9 and 10)
And   feel  no  shame    (Counting up the droplets of the tears falling from the sky)
When they are all the same?
Gonna set your mind alight
Keep you close to me and hold you tight
Wanna keep you burning bright
Take your words, shine them like a light
So come a little closer to me (Come a little closer)

To speed up the passing of time

Just please don't say you love me 
'cause I might not say it back.

49,Drag Me Down,One Direction,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/one-direction/drag-me-down-chords-1756276,"I've got fire for a heart, I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul and baby you're a boat
Baby, you're my only reason
If I didn't have you there would be nothing left
A shell of a man that could never be his best
If I didn't have you I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah
All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me
All these lights that can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me
All these lights that can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
Can drag me down
I've got fire for a heart, I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul and baby you're a boat
And baby you're my only reason
If I didn't have you there would be nothing left
A shell of a man who could never be his best
If I didn't have you I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah
All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me
All these lights that can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
But you're love, nobody can drag me down
All my life you stood by me when no one else was ever behind me
All these lights that can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
But you're love, nobody can drag me down

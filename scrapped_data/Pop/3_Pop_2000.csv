0,Bad Day (ver 7),Daniel Powter,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/daniel-powter/bad-day-chords-379698,"Where is the moment when we need it
the most
You kick up the leaves and the magic
 is lost
They tell me your blue sky's faded to
 grey
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carrying on
You stand in the line just to hit a
new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee
 to go
You tell me your life's been way off
 line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carrying on
Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it
 around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a
 ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really
don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
Well you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you
say
And I don't need no carrying on
Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it
 around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a
 ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really
don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
Sometimes the system goes on the blink
and the whole thing it turns out Wrong
You might not make it back and you
 know that you could be well oh that
Well I'm not wrong
So where is the passion when you need
 it the most
Oh you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic
is lost
Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it
 around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a
 ride
You had a bad day
You see what you like
And how does it feel 
One more time 
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

I was wanting more
But you were fucking that girl next door
What'd you do that for? (what'd you do that for?)
When you first left me
I didn't know what to say
I'd never been on my own that way
Just sat by myself all day
 I was so lost back then
 But with a little help from my friends
 I found the light in the tunnel at the end
 Now you're calling me up on the phone
 So you can have a little whine and a moan
 And it's only because you're feeling alone
 At first when I see you cry
It makes me smile
Yeah, it makes me smile
At worst I feel bad for awhile
But then I just smile
I go ahead and smile
Whenever you see me
You say that you want me back
And I tell you it don't mean jack
No, it don't mean jack
I couldn't stop laughing
No, I just couldn't help myself
See, you messed up my mental health
I was quite unwell
 I was so lost back then
 But with a little help from my friends
 I found the light in the tunnel at the end

Keeping your faith when it's gone

When you're standing here all alone...
And I will take
You in my arms
And hold you right where you belong
Till the day my life is through
This I promise you
This I promise you
I've loved you forever,
In lifetimes before
And I promise you never,
Will you hurt anymore
I give you my word
I give you my heart
This is a battle we've won
And with this vow,
Forever has now begun...
Just close your eyes
Each loving day (each loving day)

This I promise you

When I hear you call
Without you in my life baby
I just wouldn't be living at all
And I will take
You in my arms
And hold you right where you belong
Till the day my life is through
This I promise you baby
Just close your eyes

That David played and it pleased the Lord

It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled King composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Maybe I’ve been here before
I know this room, I’ve walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I’ve seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
There was a time when you let me know
What’s really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do you?
And remember when I moved in you
The Holy Dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Maybe there’s a God above
And all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
And it’s not a cry you can hear at night
It’s not somebody who’s seen the light
It’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

When you grow up livin' like a good boy oughta
And your mama takes a shine to her best son
Something different all the girls they seem to like you
Cause you're handsome like to talk and a whole lot of fun
But now your girl's gone a missin'
And your house has got an empty bed
The folks'll wonder 'bout the wedding
They won't listen to a word you said
Gonna take your mama out all night
Yeah we'll show her what it's all about
We'll get her jacked up on some cheap champagne
We'll let the good times all roll out
And if the music ain't good, well it's just too bad
We're gonna sing along no matter what
Because the dancers don't mind at the New Orleans
If you tip 'em and they make a cut
Do it -take your mama out all night
So she'll have no doubt that we're doing oh the best we can
We're gonna do it -take your mama out all night
You can stay up late 'cause baby you're a full grown man
It's a struggle livin' like a good boy oughta
In the summer watchin' all the girls pass by
When your mama heard the way that you'd been talking
I tried to tell you that all she'd wanna do is cry
Now we end up takin' the long way home
Lookin' overdressed wearin' buckets of stale cologne
It's so hard to see streets on a country road
When your glasses in the garbage
And your Continental's just got towed
Gonna take your mama out all night
Yeah we'll show her what it's all about
We'll get her jacked up on some cheap champagne
We'll let the good times all roll out
And if the music ain't good, well it's just too bad

Bring me far away...

Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky,

But they don't really comprehend...
Don't need too much talking without saying anything.

Honestly what will become of me
Don't like reality
It's way too clear to me, but
Really life is dandy
We are what we don't see
Miss everything daydreaming
   Flames to dust
Lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end
Flames to dust
Lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end
come to an end come to an
Why do all good things come to end?
come to an end come to an
Why do all good things come to an end?
Traveling I only stop at exits
Wondering if I'll stay
Young and restless living this way I stress less
I want to pull away when the dream dies
The pain sets in and I don't cry
I only feel gravity and I wonder why
  Flames to dust
Lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end
Flames to dust
Lovers to friends
Why do all good things come to an end

Barking at the new moon
Hoping it would come soon so that they could
Dogs were whistling a new tune

Well the dogs were barking at a new moon
Whistling a new tune
Hoping it would come soon
And the sun was wondering if it should 
stay away for a day til the feeling went away
And the sky was falling on the clouds were 
dropping and the rain forgot how to bring salvation
the dogs were barking at the new moon
Whistling a new tune
Hoping it would come soon so that they could die.

I must apologize for acting stank & treating you this way
Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
It's your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold?
If I could escape & recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favourite girl (forever), Perfectly together
Tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet? (sweet escape)

Come on let's bounce, counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around, let's look for some common ground
So baby, times get a little crazy
I've been gettin' a little lazy, waitin' on you to come save me
I can see that you're angry by the way that you treat me
Hopefully you don't leave me, wanted you with me

So I play along when I hear that favourite song 
I'm gonna be the one who gets it right.

Look's like magic's solely yours tonight 
But I don't feel like dancin' when the old Joanna plays 
My heart could take a chance but my two feet can't find a way 
You think that I could muster up a little soft, shoop devil sway 
But I don't feel like dancin', no sir, no dancin' today.

Don't feel like dancin', dancin',  why'd you break down when I'm not in the mood?
Don't feel like dancin', dancin' 
Rather be home with no one when I can't get down with you 
Cities come and cities go just like the old empires 
When all you do is change your clothes and call that versatile. 
You got so many colours make a blind man so confused. 
Then why can't I keep up when you're the only thing I lose? 
So I'll just pretend that I know which way to bend 
And I'm gonna tell the whole world that you're mine.
Just please understand, when I see you clap your hands
If you stick around I'm sure that you'll be fine.

Rather be home with no one when I can't get down with you

Just lay me down
As you float away into the shimmer light

hoy va ser el día menos pensado
nos hemos cruzado, has decidido mirar
a los ojitos azules que ahora van a tu lado.
Desde el momento en el que te conocí
resumiendo con prisas, tiempo de silencio.
Te juro que a nadie le he vuelto a decir
que tenemos el récord del mundo en querernos
Por eso esperaba con la carita empapada
que llegaras con rosas  con mil rosas para mi
por que ya sabes que me encantan esas cosas
que no importa si es muy tonto soy así.
Y aun me parece mentira que se escape mi vida
imaginando que vuelves  a pasarte por aquí
donde los viernes cada tarde como siempre
la esperanza dice: quieta , hoy quizá así
Escapando una noche de un bostezo de sol
me pediste que te diera un beso.
Con lo baratos que salen mi amor
¿que te cuesta callarme con uno de esos?
Pasaron seis meses y me dijiste adiós
un placer coincidir en esta vida
ahi me quedé, en una mano el corazón
y la otra excusas que ni tu entendías.
Por eso esperaba con la carita empapada
que llegaras con rosas  con mil rosas para mi
por que ya sabes que me encantan esas cosas
que no importa si es muy tonto soy así.
Y aun me parece mentira que se escape mi vida
imaginando que vuelves  a pasarte por aquí
donde los viernes cada tarde como siempre
la esperanza dice: quieta , hoy quizá así
Y es que empiezo a pensar
que el amor verdadero
es tan solo el primero
Y es que empiezo a sospechar
que los demás son solo para olvidar.
Por eso esperaba con la carita empapada
que llegaras con rosas  con mil rosas para mi
por que ya sabes que me encantan esas cosas
que no importa si es muy tonto soy así.
Y aun me parece mentira que se escape mi vida

Thank you for knowing when to hold me close
when to let me go
Thank you for every stepping stone
And for the path that always leads me home
I thank you for the time you took
to see the heart inside of me
You gave me the roots to start this life
and then you gave me wings to fly
and I learned to dream

Thank you for every selfless unsung deed
I know you did for me
Thank you for giving me the choice
To search my soul till I could find my voice
And I thank you for teaching me 
To be strong enough to bend

A smell of wine and cheap perfume
  For a smile they
can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on
Strangers waiting
 Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching
in the night
Streetlight people
 Living just to find emotion
Hiding, somewhere in the night
Working hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
just one more time
Some will win, some will lose
Some were born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on
Strangers waiting
 Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching

Hiding, somewhere in the night

Forgive all your mistakes

Would you help me understand
Are you looking down upon me
Are you proud of who I am

To look into you eyes
And see you are looking back

0,29 Strafford Apts,Bon Iver,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bon-iver/29-strafford-apts-chords-1872126,"Sharing smoke
In the stair up off the hot car lot
The sun shined hard on the video spot, hmm
Sure as any living dream
It's not all then what it seems
And the whole thing's hauled away
A Womb, an empty robe, enough
You're holding it your fabric now
Paramind
Paramind
Hallucinating Claire
Nor the snow, shoe light of the autumns
I threw the meaning out the door (Now you could be my friend)
There ain't no meaning anymore (Come and kiss me here again)
A womb, an empty robe enough
You're rolling up, you're holding it you're bent prize
Canonize, canonize
Motor up and yeah you're own
And yeah you're on your own
Fold the map, and mend the gap
And I make myself escape, oh the multitude of loving
It comes always off the page
I hold a note, you wrote and know
You've buried all your alimony butterflies
Sub find, Some night

Looking at it now it all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch, I remember
You took a Polaroid of us, then discovered
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

We were built to fall apart
And fall back together (back together)
Ooh your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying

20 stitches in the hospital room
When you started crying baby I did too 
When the sun came up I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out saying I'm setting you free
The monsters turned out to be just trees

Den som la grunden fÃ¶r att jag finns till

You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any sins
I had no idea of the state we were in
I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more
When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memories?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know
But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before

I kept my distance so you would be free

So Iâm wishing, wishing further
For the excitement to arrive
Itâs just Iâd rather be causing the chaos
Than laying at the sharp end of this knife
 With every small disaster
 Iâll let the waters still
 Take me away to some place real
'Cause they say home is where your heart is set in stone
   where you go when youâre alone

And my cuts have healed with time
Comfort will rest on my shoulder
And Iâll bury my future behind

Youâll be always on my mind
But thereâs a shining in the shadows

And I know just what she'll say if I can make all this pain go
  Can we stop this for a minute?
You know, I can tell that your heart isn't in it, or with it
Tell me with your mind, body and spirit
I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British
Whether we're together or apart
We can both remove the masks and admit that we regret it from the start

Bird goes tweet, and mouse goes squeek.
Cow goes moo, frog goes croak,
And the elephant goes toot.
Ducks says quack,  And fish go blub

     that no one knows
Ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringding!

Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!

Chasing mice and digging holes,
Tiny paws, up the hill,
Suddenly you're standing still,
Your fur is red, so beautiful,
Like an angel in disguise,
But if you meet a friendly horse,

   What does the fox say?
 The secret of the fox,
Ancient mystery,
Somewhere deep in the woods,
I know you're hiding,
What is your sound?
Will we ever know?
Will always be a mystery
What do you say?
       You're my guardian angel
Hiding in the woods,
What is your sound?
(Abubidi-bi-bum-way-dum)
Will we ever know?

I want to...
I want to know!

Et de la lumiÃ¨re dans tes yeux
Je me souviens de tes ""je t'aime""
Que tu balanÃ§ais comme des vÅux
As-tu un jour voulu qu'on sÃ¨me ?
Des pÃ©tales et des jours heureux
Ou savais-tu tous les problÃ¨mes ?
As-tu jetÃ© les dÃ©s au feu, au feu ?
C'Ã©tait de l'or, tu sais
C'Ã©tait comme de l'or notre histoire et si jamais
Si je m'en sors Ã  peu prÃ¨s
Ne t'en fais pas qu'un jour ou l'autre
Je te retrouverai, je te retrouverai
Tu m'as dit que j'Ã©tais la tienne
Qu'avec moi, le ciel est plus bleu
Tu m'as citÃ© Rimbaud, Verlaine
ContÃ© l'histoire de la vie Ã  deux, Ã  deux
Et c'Ã©tait de l'or, tu sais
C'Ã©tait comme de l'or notre histoire et si jamais
Si je m'en sors Ã  peu prÃ¨s
Ne t'en fais pas qu'un jour ou l'autre
Je te retrouverai, je te retrouverai
C'en est assez des amours blÃªmes
Et des cÅurs brisÃ©s en morceaux
De ces chansons sur le mÃªme thÃ¨me
Qui ont Ã©puisÃ© tous mes mots, tous mes mots
C'Ã©tait de l'or, tu sais
C'Ã©tait comme de l'or notre histoire et si jamais
Si je m'en sors Ã  peu prÃ¨s
Ne t'en fais pas qu'un jour ou l'autre
Je te retrouverai, je te retrouverai

It's funny how they're all the same
It's funny how you always remember
And we've both done it all a hundred times before
It's funny how I still forgot
It would be a hundred times easier
If we were young again
But as it is
And it is
We're just two slow dancers, last ones out
We're two slow dancers, last ones out
And the ground has been slowly pulling us back down
You see it on both our skin
We get a few years and then it wants us back
It would be a hundred times easier
If we were young again
But as it is
And it is
To think that we could stay the same
To think that we could stay the same
To think that we could stay the same
We're just two slow dancers, last one's out
We're two slow dancers, last ones out
Two slow dancers, last ones out

A world that's waiting up for me that I call my own
Through the dark, through the door
Through where no one's been before
But it feels like home
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say I've lost my mind
I don't care, I don't care, if they call me crazy
We can live in a world that we design
'Cause every night, I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
There's a house we can build
Every room inside is filled with things from far away
Special things I compile
Each one there to make you smile on a rainy day
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say we've lost our minds
See I don't care, I don't care, if they call us crazy
Run away to a world that we design
'Cause every night, I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
However big, however    small
Let me be part of it all
Share your dreams with me
We may be right, we may be wrong
But I wanna bring you along to the world I see
To the world we close our eyes to see
We close our eyes to see
'Cause every night, I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna m--a---ke
For the world we're gonna make

But you're sat on a train again
Your memories are sceneries for things you said
But never really meant
You build it to a high to say goodbye
Because you're not the same as them
But your death it won't happen to you
It happens to your family and your friends
I pretend
And I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die, sometimes
You win, you lose, you sing the blues
There's no point in buying concrete shoes
And I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die
Am I me through geography?
I can hardly speak
And when I try it's nothing but a squeak
On the video
Living room for small
If you can't survive; just try
And I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die, sometimes
Always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die
And I always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die, sometimes
Sometimes... Sometimes...
I... Sometimes...
Always wanna die

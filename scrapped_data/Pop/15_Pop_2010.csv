In the stair up off the hot car lot
The sun shined hard on the video spot, hmm
Sure as any living dream
It's not all then what it seems
And the whole thing's hauled away
A Womb, an empty robe, enough
You're holding it your fabric now
Paramind
Paramind
Hallucinating Claire
Nor the snow, shoe light of the autumns
I threw the meaning out the door (Now you could be my friend)
There ain't no meaning anymore (Come and kiss me here again)
A womb, an empty robe enough
You're rolling up, you're holding it you're bent prize
Canonize, canonize
Motor up and yeah you're own
And yeah you're on your own
Fold the map, and mend the gap
And I make myself escape, oh the multitude of loving
It comes always off the page
I hold a note, you wrote and know
You've buried all your alimony butterflies
Sub find, Some night

Looking at it now it all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch, I remember

But we were in screaming color

We were built to fall apart
And fall back together (back together)
Ooh your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying

20 stitches in the hospital room

When the sun came up I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat

The monsters turned out to be just trees

En anonym urna är allt som finns kvar 
Av den som förstod mig, när jag var till besvär 
Trots all den kärlek fanns jag ej där 
Jag önskar jag stannat, jag skulle blitt kvar 
Den sista stunden, det borde vart jag, och min far 
Han lärde mig växter och dess namn på latin 
Om fideikommiss och Boursin 
Men följde mig gärna in i glamrockens land 
Tog del av min kunskap om engelska band 
Allt från John Strummer till Johnny Mars 
Stod på agendan då det var jag, och min far 
Jag saknar den humor, som var hans sigill  
Den som la grunden för att jag finns till 
Som präglat min uppväxt, ända fram tills Idag 
Som gjort att min son är densamma som jag 
Jag får ta del av drömmar han har 
På samma vis som då det var jag, och min far 
Där borta vid pilen, har jag lagt min far 
En anonym urna är allt som finns kvar 
Fast jag fann aldrig modet till att säga adjö 
Trodde nog aldrig att du kunde dö

You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal any sins
I had no idea of the state we were in
I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby, please remember me once more
When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memories?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know
But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before

I kept my distance so you would be free
And hoped that you find the missing piece

A fish that’s learnt to fly
And i’ve always been a daughter
But feathers are meant for the sky
So I’m wishing, wishing further
For the excitement to arrive
It’s just I’d rather be causing the chaos
Than laying at the sharp end of this knife
 With every small disaster
 I’ll let the waters still
 Take me away to some place real
'Cause they say home is where your heart is set in stone
   where you go when you’re alone
   Is where you go to rest your bones
It’s not just where you lay your head 
It's not just where you make your bed
As long as we’re together, does it matter where we go?
 Home
 Home
So when I’m ready to be bolder,
And my cuts have healed with time
Comfort will rest on my shoulder
And I’ll bury my future behind
I’ll always keep you with me
You’ll be always on my mind
But there’s a shining in the shadows
I’ll never know unless I try
With every small disaster
I’ll let the waters still

Can we take the same road? Two days in the same clothes
And I know just what she'll say if I can make all this pain go
  Can we stop this for a minute?
You know, I can tell that your heart isn't in it, or with it
Tell me with your mind, body and spirit
I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British
Whether we're together or apart
We can both remove the masks and admit that we regret it from the start

Ducks says quack,  And fish go blub

     that no one knows
Ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringding!

Chasing mice and digging holes,
Tiny paws, up the hill,
Suddenly you're standing still,
Your fur is red, so beautiful,
Like an angel in disguise,

 The secret of the fox,
Ancient mystery,
Somewhere deep in the woods,
I know you're hiding,
What is your sound?
Will we ever know?
Will always be a mystery
What do you say?
       You're my guardian angel
Hiding in the woods,
What is your sound?

C'était comme de l'or notre histoire et si jamais

Ne t'en fais pas qu'un jour ou l'autre
Je te retrouverai, je te retrouverai

44,Two Slow Dancers,Mitski,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/mitski/two-slow-dancers-chords-2446709,"Does it smell like a school gymnasium in here?
It's funny how they're all the same
It's funny how you always remember
And we've both done it all a hundred times before
It's funny how I still forgot
It would be a hundred times easier
If we were young again
But as it is
And it is
We're just two slow dancers, last ones out
We're two slow dancers, last ones out
And the ground has been slowly pulling us back down
You see it on both our skin
We get a few years and then it wants us back
It would be a hundred times easier
If we were young again
But as it is
And it is
To think that we could stay the same
To think that we could stay the same
To think that we could stay the same
We're just two slow dancers, last one's out
We're two slow dancers, last ones out
Two slow dancers, last ones out

45,Sand,Molly Sandén,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/2479788,"Alla verkar veta vem jag är
I alla fall dom gånger jag gör fel
Alla känner mig förutom jag
Jag som knappt bestämt vem jag vill va
Fin och ful och allting däremellan
Aldrig mer, men kanske en gång till
Jag vill ha det ofta, ha det sällan
Jag vet vad jag vill, jag vet ingenting
Känns som jag är gjord utav sand
Jag bygger högt och rasar ibland
Hittar mig nån helt annanstans
Där jag kan börja om, starkare imorrn
Känns som jag är gjord utav sand
Jag bygger mina murar för hand
River dom och testar mig fram
Så jag kan börja om, större nästa gång
Just när jag tror jag har hittat hem
Ska jag packa väskorna igen
Jag vill inte ha någonting för lätt
Måste våga trampa lite snett
Stark och svag och allting däremellan
Aldrig mer, men kanske en gång till
Jag har inget val, jag måste välja
Jag vet vad jag vill, jag vet ingenting
Känns som jag är gjord utav sand
Jag bygger högt och rasar ibland
Hittar mig nån helt annanstans
Där jag kan börja om, starkare imorrn
Känns som jag är gjord utav sand
Jag bygger mina murar för hand
River dom och testar mig fram
Så jag kan börja om, större nästa gång
Helt ärligt, finns det nån som är hel?
Helt ärligt, finns det nån som aldrig nånsin gör fel?
Helt ärligt, finns det nån som lyckats leva
lyckligt med ett yttre gjort utav sten?
Det Känns som vi är gjorda utav sand
Vi bygger högt och rasar ibland
Så hittar vi oss själva nånstans
Där vi kan börja om, starkare imorrn

46,A Million Dreams,P!nk,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/pnk/a-million-dreams-chords-2518794,"I close my eyes and I can see
A world that's waiting up for me that I call my own
Through the dark, through the door
Through where no one's been before
But it feels like home
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say I've lost my mind
I don't care, I don't care, if they call me crazy
We can live in a world that we design
'Cause every night, I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
There's a house we can build
Every room inside is filled with things from far away
Special things I compile
Each one there to make you smile on a rainy day
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say we've lost our minds
See I don't care, I don't care, if they call us crazy
Run away to a world that we design
'Cause every night, I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
However big, however    small
Let me be part of it all
Share your dreams with me
We may be right, we may be wrong
But I wanna bring you along to the world I see
To the world we close our eyes to see
We close our eyes to see
'Cause every night, I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna m--a---ke
For the world we're gonna make

But you're sat on a train again
Your memories are sceneries for things you said
But never really meant
You build it to a high to say goodbye
Because you're not the same as them
But your death it won't happen to you
It happens to your family and your friends
I pretend
And I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die, sometimes
You win, you lose, you sing the blues
There's no point in buying concrete shoes
And I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die
Am I me through geography?
I can hardly speak
And when I try it's nothing but a squeak
On the video
Living room for small
If you can't survive; just try
And I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die, sometimes
Always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die
And I always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die, sometimes
Sometimes... Sometimes...
I... Sometimes...
Always wanna die
Always wanna die, sometimes

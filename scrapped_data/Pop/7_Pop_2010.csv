Got a figure like a doll
Don't care if you think I'm dumb
I don't care at all
Candy bear, sweetie pie 
I wanna be adored
I'm the girl you'd die for
I'll chew you up and, I'll spit you out
'Cause that's what young love is all about 
So pull me closer and kiss me hard
I'm gonna pop your bubble gum heart
I'm Miss Sugar Pink, liquor, liquor lips 
Hit me with your sweet love, steal me with a kiss
I'm Miss Sugar Pink, liquor, liquor lips 
I'm gonna be your bubblegum bitch 
I'm gonna be your bubblegum bitch
Queentex, latex, I'm your wondermaid
Life gave me some lemons so I made some lemonade 
Soda pop, soda pop, baby here I come
Straight to number one
Oh, dear Diary, I met a boy
He made my doll heart light up with joy 
Oh, dear Diary, we fell apart 
Welcome to the life of Electra Heart
I'm Miss Sugar Pink, liquor, liquor lips 
Hit me with your sweet love, steal me with a kiss
I'm Miss Sugar Pink, liquor, liquor lips 
I'm gonna be your bubblegum bitch 
I'm gonna be your bubblegum bitch
 I think I want your, your American tan 
 I think you're gonna be my biggest fan 
I'm Miss Sugar Pink, liquor, liquor lips 
Hit me with your sweet love, steal me with a kiss
I'm Miss Sugar Pink, liquor, liquor lips 
I'm gonna be your bubblegum bitch 
I'm gonna be your bubblegum bitch      x2

You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don't belong, oh You say I am Yours

2,This Love (ver 2),Taylor Swift,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/taylor-swift/this-love-chords-1674182," Clear blue water
 High tide, came and brought you in, and I could go, on and on, on and on
 And I will, skyes grew darker, currents swept you out again
 In silent screams, in wildest dreams
 I never dreamed of this
 This love is good, this love is bad
 This love is alive back from the dead, oh
 These hands had to let it go free
 And this love came back to me
 Tossing, turning, struggled through the night for someone new
 Lantern, burning, flickered in the mind only for you
 Through losing grip, on sinking ships
 You showed up just in time
 This love is good, this love is bad
 This love is alive back from the dead, oh
 These hands had to let it go free
 And this love came back to me
 This love left a permanent mark
 This love is glowing in the dark
 These hands had to let it go free
 And this love came back to me
 Your kiss, my cheek
 I watched you leave
 Your smile, my ghost
 I fell to my knees
 When you're young, you just run but you
 Come back to what you neeeeeeeeeeed
 This love is good, this love is bad
 This love is alive back from the dead
 These hands had to let it go free
 And this love came back to me
 This love left a permanent mark
 This love is glowing in dark

 And this love came back to me

Au gré des saisons, des photomatons
je m'abandonne à ces lueurs d'autrefois
Au gré des saisons, des décisions, je m'abandonne
Quand les souvenir s'en mêlent, les larmes me viennent, 
et le chant des sirènes me replonge en hiver 
Oh mélancolie cruelle, harmonie fluette, euphorie solitaire
Combien de farces, combien de frasques
Combien de traces, combien de masques
Avons-nous laissé là-bas
Poser les armes, prendre le large
Trouver le calme dans ce vacarme avant que je ne m'y noie
Au gré des saisons, des photomatons
je m'abandonne à ces lueurs d'autrefois

I want back my virginity so I can feel infinity
I wanna drink until I ache
I wanna make a big mistake
I want blood, guts & angel cake
I'm gonna puke it anyway

We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
""I rent a place on Cornelia Street""
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Windows swung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone
But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen
I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
  Oh-oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I don't wanna lose you, hope it never ends 
I don't wanna lose you (Yeah)
""I rent a place on Cornelia Street""
I said casually in the car

Wow, I look so weird here
My face has changed now
It's a big shame
So many feelings, struggling to leave my mouth
And it's not that rare for me to let myself down
In a big way
But I had enough time and I found enough reason to accept that
It's not the same anymore
I lost the joy in my face
My life was simple before
I should be happy, of course
But things just got much harder
Now it's just hard to ignore
It's not the same anymore
It's not the same anymore
It's not the same, but, it's not a shame 'cause
I spend a long time putting up with people
Putting on my best face
It's only normal when you stop things in the wrong way
It's only four o'clock and still, it's been a long day
I just wanna hit the hay
People knocking on me like every day
If only there could be another way
And when they want me the most
I'm tired of acting like I care, but I do
And I can't wait to hit the bed
'Cause it's not the same anymore
I lost the joy in my face
My life was simple before
I should be happy, of course (Of course)
But things just got much harder
Now it's just hard to ignore
It's not the same anymore (It's not the same)
(It's not the same)
(It's not the same)
It's not the same anymore (It's not the same)
(It's not the same)
Oh-oh
(It's not the same)
(It's not the same)
(It's not the same)
Oh-oh
I kept the feelings inside
I open up when shit gets built up this high
She makes it easy to cry
The words fall out of me and there's no more disguise
I miss the days when I was someone else
I used to be so hungry
Right now, my stomach's full as hell
And I've spent many months just hating on myself
I can't keep wishing things will be different
I wish I didn't need to get help
But I do
But I do
Oh-oh-oh
I been so hard on myself, yeah
Even my family can tell
And they barely saw what I felt
I wouldn't wish this on my enemy or anyone else
It's not the same
(It's not the same)
(It's not the same)
It's not the same as before
It's not the same anymore
I've learned so much from before
Now I'm not sure on advice
There's no excuses at all
No point in feeling upset
Won't take my place on the floor
I'll stand up straight like I'm tall
It's up to me, no one else
I'm doing this for myself
It's not the same anymore
It's better
It got better
It's not the same anymore
It's better
Yeah, yeah

Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody

 And all we know is touch and go
 We are alone with our changing minds
 We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time
 And I never never saw you coming
 And I'll never never be the same
 You come around and the armor falls
 Now all we know is don't let go
 We are alone just you and me
 Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
 So you were never a saint
 But this love is brave and wild
 And I never never saw you coming
 And I'll never never be the same
 This is a state of grace
 This is the worthwhile fight
 Love is a ruthless game
 Unless you play it good and right
 These are the hands of fate
 You're my Achilles heel
 This is the golden age of something good and right and real
 And I never never saw you coming
 And I'll never never be the same
 And I never never saw you coming
 And I'll never never be the same
 This is a state of grace
 This is the worthwhile fight
 Love is a ruthless game
 Unless you play it good and right
 Loving him is like driving a new Maserati

 Down a dead end street
 Put your lips close to mine
 As long as they don't touch
 Out of focus out of eye
 Till the gravity is too much
 And I'll do anything you say
 If you say it with your hands
 And I'd be smart to walk away but you're quick sand
 This slope is Treacherous
 This path is reckless
 This slope is Treacherous
 And I I I like it
 I can't decide if it's a choice
 Getting swept away
 I hear the sound of my own voice
 Asking you to stay
 And all we are is skin and bone
 Trained to get along
 Forever going with the flow
 But you're friction
 This slope is Treacherous
 This path is reckless
 This slope is Treacherous
 And I I I like it
 Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
 And I will get you will get you alone
 Your name has echoed through my mind
 And I just think you should think you should know
 Them not being safe is worth the driving I will follow you follow you home
 I follow you follow you home
 This hope is Treacherous
 This day dream is dangerous
 This hope is Treacherous
 I I I - I I I - I I I
 Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
 And I will get you will get you alone
 Your name has echoed through my mind
 And I just think you should think you should know
 Them not being safe is worth the driving
 I will follow you follow you home
 I follow you follow you home
 I will follow you follow you home
 I follow you follow you home
 This slope is Treacherous
 I-I-I like it
 Once upon time
 I was in your sights
 You found me
 You found me
 I guess you didn't care
 And when I fell hard
 Without me without me without me
 And he's long gone
 When he's next to me
 And I realize the blame is on me
 Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 So shame on me now-ow
 Flew me to places I'd never been
 So you put me down oh
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 So shame on me now-ow
 Flew me to places I'd never been
 Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
    Ooh    ooh     trouble trouble trouble
    Ooh    ooh     trouble trouble trouble
 No apologies
 Pretend he doesn't know
 You're drowning you're drowning you're drowning
 And I heard you moved on
 A new notch in your belt
 And now I see now I see now I see
 He was long gone
 When he met me
 And I realize the joke is on me
 Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 So shame on me now-ow
 Flew me to places I'd never been
 So you put me down oh
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 So shame on me now-ow
 Flew me to places I'd never been
 Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
    Ooh    ooh     trouble trouble trouble
    Ooh    ooh     trouble trouble trouble
 When your sadest fear comes creeping in
 That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything
 Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 So shame on me now-ow
 Flew me to places I'd never been
 So you put me down oh
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 So shame on me now-ow
 Flew me to places I'd never been
 Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
    Ooh    ooh     trouble trouble trouble
    Ooh    ooh     trouble trouble trouble
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 Trouble trouble trouble
 I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 Trouble trouble trouble
 I walked through the door with you
 The air was cold
 But something about it felt like home somehow
 And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
 And you still got it in your drawer even now
 Oh your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
 We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
 Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
 And I can picture it after all these days
 And I know it's long gone
 And that magic's not here no more
 And I might be okay
 But I'm not fine at all
 Cause there we are again on that little town street
 You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me
 Wind in my hair I was there I remember it all too well
 Photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red
 You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-size bed
 Your mother's telling stories about you on the tee ball team
 You tell me about your past thinking your future was me
 And I know it's long gone
 And there was nothing else I could do
 And I forget about you long enough
 To forget why I needed to
 Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
 We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
 Down the stairs I was there I remember it all to well
 And maybe we got lost in translation maybe I asked for too much
 But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
 Running scared I was there I remember it all too well
 And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
 So casually cruel in the name of being honest
 I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
 Cause I remember it all all all too well
 Time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
 I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
 After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
 Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
 But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
 Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
 You cant get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well yeah
 Cause there we are again when I loved you so
 Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
 It was rare I was there I remember it all too well
 Wind in my hair you were there you remember it all
 Down the stairs you were there you remember it all
 It was rare I was there I remember it all too well
 It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
 And make fun of our exes uh uh uh uh
 It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
 To fall in love with strangers uh uh uh uh
 Yeaaaah we're happy free confused and lonely at the same time
 It's miserable and magical oh yeaaaaaaah
 Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
 It's time uh uh
 I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22
 Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
 You don't know about me but I bet you want to
 Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
 Twenty-twoooooo
 Twenty-twoooooo
 It seems like one of those nights
 This place is too crowded
 Too many cool kids uh uh uh uh
 It seems like one of those nights
 We ditch the whole scene
 And end up dreaming instead of sleeping
 Yeaaaah we're happy free confused and lonely in the best way
 It's miserable and magical oh yeaaaaaaah
 Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
 It's time uh uh
 I don't know about you but I'm feeling 22
 Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
 You don't know about me but I bet you want to
 Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're

 It feels like one of those nights
 We ditch the whole scene
 It feels like one of those nights
 We won't be sleeping
 It feels like one of those nights
 You look like bad news
 I gotta have you I gotta have you
 I bet this time of night you're still up
 I bet you're tired from a long hard week
 I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window
 Looking out at the city
 And I bet sometimes you wonder about me
  And I just want to tell you
 It takes everything in me not to call you
 And I wish I could run to you
 And I hope you know that
 Everytime I don't
 I almost do
 I almost do
 I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
 Cause each time you reach out there's no reply
 I bet it never ever occurred to you
 That I can't say hello to you
 And risk another goodbye
  And I just want to tell you
 It takes everything in me not to call you
 And I wish I could run to you
 And I hope you know that
 Everytime I don't
 I almost do
 I almost do
 We made quite a mess babe
 It's probably better off this way
 In my dreams you're touching my face
 And asking me if I want to try again with you
 And I almost do
  And I just want to tell you
 It takes everything in me not to call you
 And I wish I could run to you
 And I hope you know that
 Everytime I don't
 I almost do
 I almost do
 I bet this time of night you're still up
 I bet you're tired from a long hard week
 I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window

 And I hope sometimes you wonder about me
 I remember when we broke up the first time
 Saying This is it, I've had enough 'cause like
 We hadn't seen each other in a month
 When you said you needed space, What?
 Then you come around again and say
 Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change
 Trust me, remember how that lasted for a day
 I say I hate you, we break up you call me I love you
 Ooooooooooooooh we called it off again last night
 But ooooooooooooh this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
 We are never ever ever getting back together
 We are never ever ever getting back together
 You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
 But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
 Like ever
 I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
 And me falling for it screaming that I'm right
 And you would hide away and find your piece of mind
 With some indie record that's much cooler than mine
 Ooooooooh you called me up again tonight
 But ooooooooooh this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you
 We are never ever ever getting back together
 We are never ever ever getting back together
 You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
 But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
 I used to think that we were forever ever ever
 And I used to say never say never
 Huh so he calls me up and he's like I still love you
 And I'm like I just I mean this is exhausting you know
 We are never getting back together like ever
 We are never ever ever getting back together
 We are never ever ever getting back together
 You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
 But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
 We are never ever ever getting back together
 We are never ever ever getting back together
 You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
 But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
 I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
 I threw my phone across the room at you
 I was expecting some dramatic turn away
 But yoooooooooouuuuuuuu stayed
 This morning I said we should talk about it
 Cause I read you should never leave a file unresolved
 That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
 And said okay let's talk
 And I said
 Stay stay stay
 I've been loving you for quite some
 Time time time
 You think that it's funny when I'm
 Mad mad mad
 But I think that it's best if we both
 Stay
 Before you I only dated self indulgent takers
 Who took all of their problems out on me
 But you carrying my groceries and now I'm always laughing
 And I love you because you have given me no choice but to
 Stay stay stay
 I've been loving you for quite some
 Time time time
 You think that it's funny when I'm
 Mad mad mad
 But I think that it's best if we both
 Stay  stay  stay  stay
 You took the time to memorize me
 My feels my hopes and dreams
 I just like hanging out with you all the time
 All those times that you didn't leave
 It's been occuring to me
 I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life
 Stay
 And I'll be loving you for quite some time
 No one else is gonna love me when I get
 Mad mad mad
 So I think that it's best if we both
 Stay  stay  stay  stay
 Stay stay stay
 I've been loving you for quite some
 Time time time
 You think that it's funny when I'm
 Mad mad mad
 But I think that it's best if we both
 Stay  stay  stay  stay
 Stay stay stay
 I've been loving you for quite some
 Time time time
 You think that it's funny when I'm
 Mad mad mad
 But I think that it's best if we both
 Stay
 Found myself at your door
 Just like all those times before
 I'm not sure how I got there
 All roads they lead me here
 I imagine you are home
 In your room, all alone
 And you open your eyes into mine
 And everything feels better
 Right before your eyes
 I'm breaking and fast
 No reasons why
 Just you and me
 This is the last time I'm asking you this
 Put my name on the top of your list
 This is the last time I'm asking you why
 You break my heart in the blink of an eye
 You find yourself at my door
 Just like all those times before
 You wear your best apology
 But I was there to watch you leave
 And all the times I let you in
 Just for you to go again
 Disappear when you come back
 Everything is better
 When right before your eyes
 I'm aching run fast
 Nowhere to hide
 Just you and me
 This is the last time I'm asking you this
 Put my name on the top of your list
 This is the last time I'm asking you why
 You break my heart in the blink of an eye
 This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
 This is the last time I say it's been you all along
 This is the last time I let you in my door
 This is the last time I won't hurt you anymore
 This is the last time I'm asking you this
 Put my name on the top of your list
 This is the last time I'm asking you why
 You break my heart in the blink of an eye
 This is the last time I'm asking you this
 Put my name on the top of your list
 This is the last time I'm asking you why
 You break my heart in the blink of an eye
 This is the last time I'm asking you this
 Time I'm asking you this
 Time I'm asking you this
 This is the last time I'm asking you this
 Time I'm asking you this
 Time I'm asking you this
 This is the last time I'm asking you this
 Time I'm asking you this
 Time I'm asking you this
 This is the last time I'm asking you this
 Time I'm asking you this
 Time I'm asking you this
 I was reminiscing just the other day
 Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
 Took off fast through the green light go
 I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
 And that was the first day
 And darling it was good
 Never looking down
 And right there where we stood
 Was holy ground
 Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
 We blocked the noise with the sound of I need you
 Well I guess we fell apart in the usual way
 Sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
 And I see your face in every crowd
 And darling it was good
 Never looking down
 And right there where we stood
 Was holy ground
 Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through
 Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in this room
 But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
 It was good
 Never looking down
 And right there where we stood
 Was holy ground
 Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through
 But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
 Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in this room
 But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
 Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
 Words how little they mean when you're a little too late
 I stood right by the tracks your face in a locket
 Good girls hopeful they'll be and long they will wait
 We had a beautiful magic love there
 What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
 In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
 We both wake in lonely beds and different cities
 And time is taking it's sweet time erasing you
 And you've got your demons and darling they all look like me
 'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
 What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
 Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
 Silence, this train runs off its tracks
 Kiss me, try to fix it would you just try to listen
 Hang up, give up, for the life of us we can't get back
 A beautiful magic love there
 What a sad beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful
 What we had, a beautiful magic love there
 What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
 We had a beautiful magic love there
 What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
 New to town with a made up name
 In the angel city chasing fortune and fame
 And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
 You had it figured out since you were in school
 Everybody loves pretty everybody loves cool
 So overnight you look like a sixties' queen
 Another name goes up in lights
 Like diamonds in the sky
 And they'll tell you now
 You're the lucky one
 Yeah they'll tell you now
 But can you tell me now
 You're the lucky one  oh oh ohhh
 Now it's big black cars and Riviera views
 And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
 And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
 And they tell you that you're lucky
 Cause you don't feel pretty you just feel used
 And all the young things line up to take your place
 Another name goes up in lights
 You wonder if you'll make it out alive
 And they'll tell you now
 You're the lucky one
 Yeah they'll tell you now
 But can you tell me now
 You're the lucky one  oh oh ohhh
 It was a few years later I showed up here
 And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
 How they took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
 They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
 Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square
 And it took some time but I understand it now
 Cause now my name is up in lights
 But I think you got it right
 Let me tell you now
 You're the lucky one
 Let me tell you now
 Let me tell you now
 You're the lucky one  oh oh ohhh
 Yeah they'll tell you now
 You're the lucky one
 Yeah they'll tell you now
 But can you tell me now
 You're the lucky one  oh oh ohhh
 All I knew this morning when I woke
 Is I know something now know something now I didn't before
 And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
 In the back of my mind making me feel right
 I just want to know you better know you better know you better now
 I just want to know you better know you better know you better now
 I just want to know you better know you better know you better now
 I just want to know you know you know you
 Cause all I know is we said hello
 And your eyes look like coming home
 All I know is a simple name
 Everything has changed
 All I know is we held the door
 You'll be mine and I'll be yours
 All I know since yesterday is
 Everything has changed
 And all my walls stood tall painted blue
 But I'll take them down take them down
 And open up the door for you
 And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies the beautiful kind
 Making up for lost time taking flight making me feel right
 I just want to know you better know you better know you better now
 I just want to know you better know you better know you better now
 I just want to know you better know you better know you better now
 I just want to know you know you know you
 Cause all I know is we said hello
 And your eyes look like coming home
 All I know is a simple name
 Everything has changed
 All I know is we held the door
 You'll be mine and I'll be yours
 All I know since yesterday is
 Everything has changed
 Come back and tell me why
 I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
 And meet me there tonight
 And let me know that it's not all in my mind
 I just want to know you better know you better know you better now
 I just want to know you know you know you
 Cause all I know is we said hello
 And your eyes look like coming home
 All I know is a simple name
 Everything has changed
 All I know is we held the door
 You'll be mine and I'll be yours
 All I know since yesterday is
 Everything has changed
 All I know is we said hello
 So dust off your highest hopes
 All I know is pouring rain
 And everything has changed
 All I know is a newfound brightness
 All my days I'll know your face
 All I know since yesterday is
 Everything has changed
 I said oh my what a marvelous tune
 It was the best night never would forget how we moved
 The whole place was dressed to the nines 
 And we were dancing, dancing
 Like we're made of starlight 
 Like we're made of starlight
 I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
 Picked me up late one night out the window
 We were 17 and crazy running wild, wild
 Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
 The night we snuck into a yacht club party
 Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
 I said oh my what a marvelous tune
 It was the best night never would forget how we moved
 The whole place was dressed to the nines 
 And we were dancing, dancing
 Like we're made of starlight, starlight 
 Like we're made of starlight, starlight
 He said ""look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change
 You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way""
 He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
 ""Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
 Don't you dream impossible things?""
 Like oh my what a marvelous tune
 It was the best night never would forget how we moved
 The whole place was dressed to the nines 
 And we were dancing dancing
 Like we're made of starlight starlight 
 Like we're made of starlight starlight
 Ooh ooh he's talking crazy
 Ooh ooh dancing with me
 Ooh ooh we could get married
 Have ten kids and teach them how to dream
 Oh my what a marvelous tune
 It was the best night never would forget how we moved
 The whole place was dressed to the nines 
 And we were dancing dancing
 Like we're made of starlight starlight 
 Like we're made of starlight starlight
 Like we're made of starlight starlight
 Like we dream impossible dreams
 Like starlight starlight
 Like we dream impossible dreams
 Don't you see the starlight starlight
 Don't you dream impossible things
 Took a deep breath in the mirror
 But I do
 Turn the lock and put my headphones on
 But I do I do
 Walked in expecting you'd be late
 I walk to you
 You pull my chair out and help me in
 But I do
 And you throw your head back laughing
 Like a little kid
 I think it's strange that you think I'm funny cause
 He never did
 I've been spending the last 8 months
 Thinking all love ever does
 Is break and burn and end
 But on a Wednesday in a cafe
 I watched it begin again
 You said you never met one girl who
 But I do
 We tell stories and you don't know why
 But I do
 And you throw your head back laughing
 Like a little kid
 I think it's strange that you think I'm funny cause
 He never did
 I've been spending the last 8 months
 Thinking all love ever does
 Is break and burn and end
 But on a Wednesday in a cafe
 I watched it begin again
 And we walked down the block to my car
 But you start to talk about the movies
 That your family watches every single Christmas
 And I want to talk about that
 And for the first time
 And you throw your head back laughing
 Like a little kid
 I think it's strange that you think I'm funny cause
 He never did
 I've been spending the last 8 months
 Thinking all love ever does
 Is break and burn and end
 But on a Wednesday in a cafe
 I watched it begin again
 But on a Wednesday in a cafe
 You should've been there
 Should've burst through the door
 With that baby I'm right here smile
 And it would've felt like
 A million little shining stars had just aligned
 And I would've been so happy
 Christmas lights glisten
 I've got my eye on the door
 Just waiting for you to walk in
 But the time is ticking
 People ask me how I've been
 As I comb back through my memory
 How you said you'd be here
 You said you'd be here
 And it was like slow motion
 Standing there in my party dress
 In red lipstick
 With no one to impress
 And they're all laughing
 As I'm looking around the room
 But there's one thing missing
 And that was the moment I knew
 And the hours pass by
 Now I just wanna be alone
 But your close friends always seem to know
 When there's something really wrong
 So they follow me down the hall
 And there in the bathroom
 I try not to fall apart
 And the sinking feeling starts
 He said he'd be here
 And it was like slow motion
 Standing there in my party dress
 In red lipstick
 With no one to impress
 And they're all laughing
 As I'm looking around the room
 But there's one thing missing
 And that was the moment I knew
 What do you say when tears are streaming down your face
 In front of everyone you know?
 And what do you do when the one who means the most to you
 Is the one who didn't show?
 You should've been here
 And I would've been so happy
 And it was like slow motion
 Standing there in my party dress
 In red lipstick
 With no one to impress
 And they're all sitting around me singing
 Happy birthday to you
 But there's one thing missing
 And that was the moment I knew
 Ooooooooooooooooh I knew
 Ooooooooooooooooh
 You call me later
 And say I'm sorry I didn't make it
 And I say I'm sorry too
 And that was the moment I knew
 You said it in a simple way
 4 am the second day
 How strange that I don't know
 You at all
 We stumble through the long goodbye
 One last kiss and catch your flight
 Right when I was just about to fall
 I told myself don't get attached
 But in my mind I play it back
 Spinning faster than the plane that took you
 This is when the feeling sinks in
 I dont wanna miss you like this
 Come back, be here
 Come back, be here
 I guess you're in New York today
 I dont wanna need you this way
 Come back, be here
 Come back, be here
 The delicate beginning rush
 The feeling you can know so much
 Without knowing anything at all
 And now that I can put this down
 If I had known what I know now
 I never would have played
 So nonchalance
 Taxi cabs and busy streets
 They never bring you back to me
 I can't help but wish you took me with you
 This is when the feeling sinks in
 I dont wanna miss you like this
 Come back, be here
 Come back, be here
 I guess you're in London today
 I dont wanna need you this way
 Come back, be here
 Come back, be here
 This is falling in love in the cruelest way
 This is falling for you when you are worlds away
 New York, be here
 But you're in
 London and I break down cause it's not fair
 This is when the feeling sinks in
 I dont wanna miss you like this
 Come back, be here
 Come back, be here
 I guess you're in New York today
 I dont wanna need you this way
 Come back, be here
 Come back, be here
 Come back, be here
 Come back, be here
 Don't look at me
 You've got a girl at home
 And everybody knows that
 Don't look at me
 You've got a girl at home
 And everybody knows that
 I don't even know her
 But I feel a responsibility
 To do what's upstanding and right
 It's kinda like a code yeah
 And you've been getting closer and closer
 And it would be a fine proposition
 If I was a stupid girl
 But honey I am no-one's exception
 This I have previously learned
 Don't look at me
 You've got a girl at home
 And everybody knows that
 Don't look at me
 You've got a girl at home
 And everybody knows that
 I see you turn off your phone
 And now you got me alone
 Don't look at me
 You've got a girl at home
 And everybody knows that
 I just wanna make sure
 You understand perfectly
 You're the kind of man who makes me sad
 While she waits up
 You chase down the newest thing
 And take for granted what you have
 And it would be a fine preposition
 If I was a stupid girl
 And yeah I might go with it
 If I hadn't once been just like her
 Don't look at me
 You've got a girl at home
 And everybody knows that
 Don't look at me
 You've got a girl at home
 And everybody knows that
 I see you turn off your phone
 And now you got me alone
 Don't look at me
 You've got a girl at home
 And everybody knows that
 Call a cab
 Lose my number
 You're about to lose your girl
 Call a cab
 Lose my number
 Let's consider this lesson learned
 Don't look at me
 You've got a girl at home
 And everybody knows that
 Don't look at me
 You've got a girl at home
 And everybody knows that
 Wanna see you pick up your phone
 And tell her you're coming home
 Don't look at me
 You've got a girl at home
 And everybody knows that
 Don't look at me
 You've got a girl at home
 And everybody knows that
 It would be a fine proposition
 If I hadn't once been just like her
 I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
 And all we know is touch and go
 We are alone with our changing minds
 We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time
 And I never never saw you coming
 And I'll never never be the same
 You come around and the armor falls
 Now all we know is don't let go
 We are alone just you and me
 Just twin fire signs four blue eyes
 So you were never a saint
 But this love is great and wild
 And I never never saw you coming
 And I'll never never be the same
 This is a state of grace
 This is the worthwhile fight
 Love is a ruthless game
 Unless you play it good and right
 These are the hands of fate
 You're my Achilles heel
 This is the golden age of something good and right and real
 And I never never saw you coming
 And I'll never never be the same
 And I never never saw you coming
 And I'll never never be the same
 This is a state of grace
 This is the worthwhile fight
 Love is a ruthless game
 Unless you play it good and right

  Singing blues has been getting old
You can be my full- time baby, hot or cold
Don't break me down

I've been trying too hard

  I am alone at midnight
  Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I

So, I just ride
I just ride
So, I just ride
I just ride

That's the way my father made his life an art
  Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it, light 'til dark
Don't leave me now
Don't say goodbye
Don't turn around
Leave me high and dry

  Weigh down in my soul
  And the pain of my mother
  Will not let me go
  Well I know there can come fire from the sky
  To refine the purest of kings
  And even though I know this fire brings me pain
  Even so and just the same
Make it rain
Make it rain down Lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down Lord
Make it rain
Make it rain
  And the seed needs the water
  Before it grows out of the ground
  But it just keeps on getting hotter
  And the hunger more profound
  Well I know there can come tears from the eyes
  But they may as well all be in vain
  Even though I know this tears come with pain
  Even so and just the same
Make it rain
Make it rain down Lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down Lord
Make it rain
Make it rain
  And the seas are full of water
  That stop by the shore
  Just like the riches of grandeur
  That never reach the poor
  So let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
  And let lightning be the veins
  And fill the sky with all that they can drop
  When it's time to make a change 
Make it rain
Make it rain down Lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain

   Bury a friend, try to wake up (ah-ah)
   Cannibal class, killing the son (ah-ah)

     It's probably something that shouldn't be said out loud
     Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (wow)
     Calling security, keeping my head held down
     Bury the hatchet or bury your friend right now
The debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
And my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close

Got one too many quarters in my pocket
Count 'em like four leaf clovers in my locket
Untied laces
Just tripping on daydreams
Got dirty little lullabies playing on repeat
Might as well just rot around the nursery and count sheep

32,Born To Die Album,Lana Del Rey,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lana-del-rey/born-to-die-chords-1425608,"Feet don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line
All my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping that the gates,
Walking through the city streets
Is it by mistake or design'
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you're mine
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough when the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh,
Let's go get high
Road's long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words
This is the last time
Cause you and I, we were born to die
Lost but now I am found
I can see but once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough when the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh,
Let's go get high
Road's long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words
This is the last time
Cause you and I, we were born to die
                        We were born to die
                        We were born to die
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough when the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh,
Let's go get high
Road's long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words
This is the last time
Cause you and I, we were born to die
My old man is a bad man but
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart
He doesn't mind I have an LA crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart
Swimming pool glimmering darling
Watch me in the swimming pool bright blue ripples
You sit sippin' on your black Cristal, yeah
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Give me them gold coins, gimme them coins
And I'm off to the races, cases
Cuz he knows I'm wasted, facing
Because I'm crazy, baby I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet singing in the garden
Ready for you
My old man is a tough man but
And he shows me, he knows me
Every inch of my tar black soul
In fact he says he thinks it's why he might like about me
Admires me, the way I roll like a Rolling Stone
Likes to watch me in the glass room bathroom, Chateau Marmont
Glass room perfume Cognac lilac fume
Light of his life, fire of his loins
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me, gimme them coins
And I'm off to the races, cases
Cuz he knows I'm wasted, facing
Because I'm crazy, baby I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet singing in the garden
Now I'm off to the races, laces
I can see your face is shameless, Cipriani's basement
God I'm so crazy, baby, I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet, Queen of Coney Island
Sorry 'bout it
My old man is a thief and I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
But I trust in the decision of the lord to watch over us
I'm not afraid to say that I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
They would rue the day I was alone without you
You're lying with your gold chain on, cigar hanging from your lips
I said ""Hon' you never looked so beautiful as you do now, my man.""
And we're off to the races, places
to Las Vegas pay us, Casino Oasis, honey it is time to spin
Boy you're so crazy, baby, I love you forever not maybe
You are my one true love
Blue jeans, White shirt
Walked into the room you know you made my eyes burn
It was like, James Dean, for sure
You so fresh to death and sick as ca-ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
But you fit me better than my favourite sweater, and I know
That love is mean, and love hurts
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby!
I will love you till the end of time
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Love you more, than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh baby, say you'll remember
I will love you till the end of time
Big dreams, Gangster
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like: ""No please"", ""Stay here""
""We don't need no money we can make it all work""
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipating and pacing but he was
Chasing, Paper
""Caught up in the game"" that was the last I heard
I will love you till the end of time
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Love you more, than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh baby, say you'll remember
I will love you till the end of time
He went out every night, And baby that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did, I'd be by your side
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
I just want it like before, We were dancing all night
I will love you till the end of time
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Love you more, than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh baby, say you'll remember
I will love you till the end of time
Swinging in the backyard
Pull up in your fast car
Whistling my name
Open up a beer
And you take it over here
And play a video game
I'm in his favorite sun dress
Watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown
I say you the bestest
Lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite perfume on
Go play a video game
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby now you do
Singing in the old bars
Swinging with the old stars
Living for the fame
Kissing in the blue dark
Playing pool and wild darts
Video games
He holds me in his big arms
Drunk and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of
Watching all our friends fall
In and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playing video games
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby now you do
Now you do, now you do, now you do
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby now you do
Now you do, now you do, now you do (repeat)
You're no good for me
Baby you're no good for me
You're no good for me
Diet Mountain Dew baby New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Baby put on heart-shaped sunglasses
Cause we're gonna take a ride
I'm not gonna listen to what the past says
I been waiting up all night
Take another drag turn me to ashes
Ready for another lie
Says he's gonna teach me just what fast is
Say it's gonna be alright
Hit me my darling tonight
I don't know why but I like it
Gotta get back to the wild
Give it up give it up
Live it up live it up
Diet Mountain Dew baby New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Diet Mountain Dew baby New York City
Can we get it down low down 'n gritty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Let's take Jesus off the dashboard
Got enough on His mind
We both know just what we're here for
Saved too many times
Maybe I like this roller coaster
Maybe it keeps me high
Maybe this beat it brings me closer
I could sparkle up your eye
Hit me and tell me you're mine
I don't know why but I like it
Scare me my God you're divine
Gimme them gimme them
Dope and diamonds
Diet Mountain Dew baby New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Diet Mountain Dew baby New York City
Can we get it down low down 'n gritty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
You're no good for me
Baby you're no good for me

Baby you're no good for me
You're no good for me
Diet Mountain Dew baby New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Baby stopping at 7Eleven
There in his white Pontiac heaven
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Diet Mountain Dew baby New York City
Can we get it down low down 'n gritty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Diet Mountain Dew baby New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Money is the anthem
Of success
So before we go out
I'm your National Anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons
He loves to romance them
Reckless abandon
Holdin' me for ransom
He says to ""be cool"" but
I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair
Hand on the back of my neck
I said, ""Can we party later on?""
He said, ""Yes, yes""
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Red, white, blue's in the skies
Summer's in the air and
Baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your National Anthem
Money is the reason
We exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact
I sing the National Anthem
While I'm standing over your body
And you can't keep your hands off me
See what you've done to me
You said to ""be cool"" but
I'm already coolest
You said to ""get real""
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
(Yes, also a gun)
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Red, white, blue's in the skies
Summer's in the air and
Baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your National Anthem
It's a love story for the new age
For the six page
Wining and dining
Excessive buying
On our drugs and our love
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely
I need somebody to hold me
We will do very well
I can tell, I can tell
Keep my safe in his bell tower, hotel
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara, and your party dress
I'm your National Anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of
Sweetness and danger
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Red, white, blue's in the skies
Summer's in the air and
Baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your National Anthem
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
All my friends tell me I should move on
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song
Ahhh, that's how you sang it
Loving you forever, can't be wrong
Even though you're not here, won't move on
Ahhh, that's how we played it
And there's no remedy for memory your face is
Like a melody, it won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me and telling me
That everything is fine
But I wish I was dead
Every time I close my eyes                              |
It's like a dark paradise                               |
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side  |
All my friends ask me why I stay strong
Tell 'em when you find true love it lives on
Ahhh, that's why I stay here
And there's no remedy for memory your face is
Like a melody, it won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me and telling me
That everything is fine
But I wish I was dead
Every time I close my eyes                              
It's like a dark paradise                               
No one compares to you                                  
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side  
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight
Oh oh oh oh, ha ha ha ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh oh oh oh, ha ha ha ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
There's no relief, I see you in my sleep
And everybody's rushing me, but I can feel you touching me
There's no release, I feel you in my dreams
Telling me I'm fine
Every time I close my eyes                              
It's like a dark paradise                               
No one compares to you                                  
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side  
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight
Oh oh oh oh, ha ha ha ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh oh oh oh, ha ha ha ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Not even they can stop me now
Boy, I'll be flying overhead
Their heavy words can't bring me down
Boy I've been raised from the dead
No one even knows how hard life was
I don't even think about it now because
I've finally found you
Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby love me cause I'm playing on the radio
Pick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom oh yeah
Baby love me cause I'm playing on the radio
American dreams came true somehow
I swore I'd chase them til I was dead
I heard the streets were paved with gold
That's what my father said
No one even knows what life was like
Now I'm in LA and it's paradise
I've finally found you
Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby love me cause I'm playing on the radio
Pick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom oh yeah
Baby love me cause I'm playing on the radio
Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby love me cause I'm playing on the radio
Now my life is sweet like cinnamon                                        
like a fucking dream I'm living in
I finally found you
Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby love me cause I'm playing on the radio
Pick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom oh yeah
Baby love me cause I'm playing on the radio

Darling, darling, doesn't have a problem
Lying to herself cause her liquour's top shelf
It's alarming honestly how charming she can be
Fooling everyone, telling them she's having fun
She says you don't want to be like me
Don't wanna see all the things I've seen
I'm dying, I'm dying
She says, ""you don't want to get this way
Famous, and dumb, at an early age""
Lying, I'm lying
The boys, the girls, they all like carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like god, her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies, she's still shining
Like lightning, oh-oh, white lightning
Carmen, carmen, staying up til morning
Only seventeen, but she walks the streets so mean
It's alarming truly how disarming you can be
Eating soft ice cream, coney island queen
She says you don't want to be like me
Looking for fun, getting high for free
I'm dying, I'm dying
She says ""you don't want to get this way
Street walk at night, and a star by day""
It's tiring, tiring
The boys, the girls, they all like carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like god, her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies, she's still shining
Like lightning, oh-oh, white lightning
Baby's all dressed up, with nowhere to go
That's the little story of the girl you know
Relying on the kindness of strangers
Tying and cherry knots, smiling, doing party favours
Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on
Sing your song, song, now, the camera's on
And you're alive again
Mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi
Tu as besoin de moi
Tu as besoin de moi dans ta vie
Tu ne peux plus vivre sans moi
Et je mourrais sans toi
Je tuerais pour toi
The boys, the girls, they all like carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like god, her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies, she's still shining
Like lightning, oh-oh, white lightning
Like lightning, oh-oh, white lightning
Darling, darling, doesn't have a problem
Lying to herself 'cause her liquour's top shelf...
You said I was the most exotic flower
Holding me tight in our final hour
I don't know how you convince them and get them
I don't know what you do, it's unbelievable
And I don't know how you get over, get over
Someone as dangerous, tainted and flawed as you
One for the money, and two for the show
I love you honey, I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant,
Look like a million dollar man,
So why is my heart broke?
You got the world but baby at what price?
Something so strange, hard to define
It isn't that hard boy to like you or love you
I'd follow you down down down,
If you're going crazy just grab me and take me
I'd follow you down down down, anywhere anywhere
One for the money, and two for the show
I love you honey, I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant,
Look like a million dollar man,
So why is my heart broke?
One for the money, and two for the show
I love you honey, I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant,
Look like a million dollar man,
So why is my heart broke?
   I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant,
Look like a million dollar man,
So why is my heart broke?
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you're the best
I got my red dress on tonight
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Got my hair up real big beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feeling alive
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me any more
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you're the best
I've got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh oh
I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruising down the coast goin' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me any more
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you're the best
I've got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh oh
I think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning skies
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone I'm gonna drive, drive
I've got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh oh
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you're the best
I've got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh oh
Remember how we used to party up all night
Sneaking out and looking for a taste of real life
Drinking in the small town firelight
(Pabst Blue Ribbon on ice)
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Walking down the street as they whistle, ""Hi, hi!""
Stealin' police cars with the senior guys
Teachers said we'd never make it out alive
There she was my new best friend
High heels in her hands, swayin' in the wind
While she starts to cry, mascara runnin' down her little Bambi eyes:
This is what makes us girls
We don't look for heaven and we put our love first
Don't you know we'd die for it? It's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen
And that's where the beginning of the end begun
Everybody knew that we had too much fun
We were skippin' school and drinkin' on the job
(With the boss)
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Baby's table dancin' at the local dive
Cheerin our names in the pink spotlight
Drinkin' cherry schnapps in the velvet night
Know we used to go break in
to the hotel pool, glittering we'd swim
Runnin' from the cops in our black bikini tops
screaming, ""Get us while we're hot""
This is what makes us girls
We don't look for heaven and we put our love first
Don't you know we'd die for it? It's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen
The prettiest crowd that you had ever seen
Ribbons in our hair and our eyes gleamed mean
A freshmen generation of degenerate beauty queens
And you know something?
They were the only friends I ever had
We got into trouble and when stuff got bad
I got sent away, I was waving on the train platform
Crying 'cause I know I'm never comin' back.
This is what makes us girls
We don't look for heaven and we put our love first
Don't you know we'd die for it? It's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
Darlin' little queens do you know what you're worth?
I'll tell you everyday till you get it, girl
It's all gonna happen
This is what makes us girls now, baby.
This is why we rule the world now, baby.
This is what makes us girls now, baby.
Why we rule the world now, baby, oh.

  You look so wonderful in your dress
 I love your hair like that
 The way it falls on the side of your neck
 Down your shoulders and back
 We are surrounded by all of these lies
 And people who talk too much
 You've got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love
 You look so beautiful in this light
 Your silhouette over me
 The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
is the Tenerife Sea 
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and now we'll disappear
oh, into the wilderness
And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
I'm so in love

Most days I don't recognize me
With these shoes and this apron
That place and its patrons
Have taken more than I gave them
It's not easy to know
I'm not anything like I used to be
Although it's true
I was never attention's sweet center
But I still remember that girl
She's imperfect but she tries
She is good but she lies
She is hard on herself
She is broken and won't ask for help
She is messy but she's kind
She is lonely, most of the time
She is all of this, mixed up
And baked in a beautiful pie
She is gone, but she used to be mine
And it's not what I asked for
Sometimes life just slips in through a backdoor
And carves out a person and makes you believe it's all true
Now I've got you
And you're not what I asked for
If I'm honest, I know I would give it all back
For a chance to start over
And rewrite an ending or two
For the girl that I knew
Who'll be reckless, just enough
Who'll get hurt
But who learns how to toughen up when she's bruised
And gets used by a man who can't love
And then she'll get stuck and be scared
Of the life that's inside her
Growing stronger each day
Till it finally reminds her
To fight just a little
To bring back the fire in her eyes
That's been gone, but used to be mine
Used to be mine
She is messy, but she's kind
She is lonely, most of the time
She is all of this, mixed up, and baked in a beautiful pie
She is gone, but she used to be mine

 The moon we love like a brother, while he glows through the room
Dancin' around the lies we tell
Dancin' around big eyes as well
 Even the comatose   they don’t dance and tell
 We live in cities you'll never see on screen
 Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
 Living in ruins  of the palace within my dreams
 And you know, we're on each other's team

So all the cups got broke
Shards beneath our feet 
But it wasn't my fault
And everyone's competing for a love they won't receive
'Cause what this palace wants is release

And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
Take my hand and my
heart and soul I will
Only have these eyes for you
You know everything changes
But we'll be strangers
If we see this through.
And you could stay within these walls and bleed
But just stay with me
All my senses come to life
While I am stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been, and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one
I'm stumbling off drunk
Getting myself lost
I am so gone,
So tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
All my senses come to life
While I am stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been, and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one

There's a pounding my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbie's on the barbeque
There's a hickie or a bruise
Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well
It's a black top blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled
Yeah
Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot
Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trois
Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op
Whoa-oh-oah
This Friday night
Do it all again
This Friday night
Do it all again
Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
With my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

0,Holy,Justin Bieber,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/justin-bieber/holy-chords-3340592," I hear a lot about sinners
 Don't think that I'll be a saint
 But I might go down to the river
Yeah, it's making me say
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy,
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
  I don't do well with the drama
  And no I can't stand it being fake 
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no)
  I don't believe in nirvana
Baby, I can't explain
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy,
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
  They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
  They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know (Chance the Rapper)
  The first step pleases the Father   
  Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water  
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a jetski
I know the spots that go the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you 
Bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds (Uh)
  I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up (Ooh)
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust (Woo)
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy,
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so ho-ho-ho-holy

 I used to spend so many nights on my own
 I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore

She took me for a spin
We’re riding around this carousel
Getting dizzy ’til we’re sick
Love is like a circle, there’s no easy way to end
It’s too much, I can’t take anymore
  Stuck feeling like we’ve been here before
  But now the sun stopped shining here in the Wild West
  My heart stopped beating, it has sunk into my chest

Five words that I've heard before

And tied a noose around my throat
You're gone then back at my door
'Cause if you're gonna leave, better leave, better do it fast
Can't live a little longer sitting on your lap
'Cause you know what you're doin' when you're comin' back
And I don't wanna have another heart attack
Every other week, when you please
Oh, I can't be the kiss that you don't need
The lie between your teeth
The cut that always bleeds

The cut that always bleeds
(Ah-ah-ah)
Say you love somebody new
Then beat my heart to black and blue
Then they leave, and it's me you come back to (Ah-ah)
To say you loved me all along
And kiss the bruises 'til they're gone
Bittersweet, 'cause I can't breathe inside your arms
'Cause if you're gonna leave, better leave, better do it fast
Can't live another minute bleedin' from my back
'Cause I don't have another one for you to stab
And I don't wanna have another heart attack

Headstones on a lawn
And when I was younger, I knew a boy and a boy
Best friends with each other, but always wished they were more
'Cause they loved one another, but never discovered
'Cause they were too afraid of what they'd say
Moved to different states
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
But I think that it could work for you and me
Just wait and see
It's not the end of the story
Now it's on to the sequel about me and my friend
Both our parents were evil, so we both made a bet
If we worked and we saved, we could both run away
And we'd have a better life, and I was right
I wonder if she's alright
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works

You're cute enough to fuck with me tonight
Looking at the table, all I see is weed and white
Baby, you living the life, but nigga, you ain't living right
 Cocaine and drinking with your friends
You live in the dark, boy, I cannot pretend

 I wanna feel on your ass in Hawaii
 I want that jet lag from fuckin' and flyin'
 Shoot a child in your mouth while I'm ridin'

A sign of the times every time that I speak
A dime and a nine, it was mine every week
What a time, an incline, God was shinin' on me

  You were dancing in the street rocking that pink and leather
  Begged my friend for your number I bet you don’t remember
That’s how we began
  I pursued you for a year I would have waited longer
  I knew ultimately it would make the feeling stronger
  That first time I kissed you I could look in the mirror
And like who I was
I could never wait for the weekends when you would come over
Cause that’s when I’d see you again
You’re all my strength and my weakness
You battle my demons
You’re still undefeated
Sometimes I get a little bit jaded
Too much pressure just to make it
You smile when I’m angry and I hate it
But I’ll still love you for the rest of my life
My crush on you has never faded
Let’s go back to bed until we break it
I’m gonna love you for the rest of my life
Ooh
If you wanted to
  I remember being foolish when I met your mother
  Cause she had that Irish charm right then I knew I’d love her
  That’s where you got your heart
When we got back to the car
I knew you were the one

Over in the corner there
Sitting empty on the bathtub rail
Wishing they could wash your hair
Yea I keep em by that crumb of fancy soap
And your toothbrush at my bathroom sink
Your cellphone chargers still hanging from the wall
Haven’t chucked it all, like you’d think
Though you haven’t been around in weeks
  I’ve run out of my speed stick honey
So I have been using yours
Its frickin trash all that Organic hoo hah
From one of your health food stores
It is seemingly worsened everyday
All this shit of yours around my house
If I could’ve had it any other way
Then by now I would’ve chucked it out
But it seems to wanna stick around.
  I’ve been leaving you in radio silence
Though I’d love to catch a pass
  Waited long enough that I could never call you
Baby how fucked is that
And it’s all just so forgettable
Til I’m sitting with your stuff alone
Man why can’t I just let it go
  I’ve been seeing that red corolla parked out on the corner there
If it were yours there’d be some hippie bull shit hanging from the rear-view mirror
As I’m passing it every other day
I look in to see if this one’s yours
But the shape it’s in is giving it away
Yours is dented up and down the doors
Never wanted to see it more
  I’ve been leaving you in radio silence
Though I’d love to catch a pass
Waited long enough that I could never call you
Baby how fucked is that

Para escapar de este pozo de dolor
 Que nos arrastra a los dos y no queremos

sleeping in the seat next to me
Like a baby,   you twist and you turn
You're travelling fast
like a bird in a dream
Look at it go, look at it dance
over the sky like a rocket
A love machine, a cinematic dream
So pure and it hurts when the
beauty is lost in the speed
'Cause everything matters to me
(To me, to me, to me, to me)
To me
You're a part of the dawn
where the light comes
from the dark
You're a part of the
morning and еverything matters
Herе we are, an atom and a star
You're a part of the
movement and everything matters
(To me, to me, to me, to me)
I'm watching your
storm turn into form
And the clouds of the
world like a burst
It dances and it twirls
On top of the world,
it is good and it hurts
Look at it go, look at it dance
over the sky like a rocket
A teacher, a simulated dream
A cure, a cure for the hurt
And the pleasure you feel is real
You're a part of the dawn
where the light comes
from the dark
You're a part of the
morning and everything matters
And we are, an atom and a star
You're a part of the

Hurts when I remember and I never wanna feel it again

That you were always with me when it hurts I know that you understand

And I asked her father but her daddy said no, you can't marry my daughter

Nancy was my yellow rose and we got married wearing borrowed clothes

Want me, want me if you want me
Want me, want me if you want me
Want me, want me if you want me
Want me, want me if you want me
Want me, want me if you want me
No offense but it makes no sense
You're in her bed then you're driving home and playing my cassette
Because you want me and you just don't know it yet
And I'm in debt because I'm just a kid
Now you're smoking cigarettes
Because you want me and you just don't know it yet
I bet you get bored having sex
Because you want me and you just don't know it yet
No offense but it makes no sense
You're in her bed then you're driving home and playing my cassette
Because you want me and you just don't know it yet
And I'm in debt because I'm just a kid
Now you're smoking cigarettes
Because you want me and you just don't know it yet
I bet you get bored having sex
Because you want me and you just don't know it yet

He won't pick up his phone
Please don't try my father either
He ain't been home for years
I know I'm no spirit seeker
I can't sleep through the tears
I get lost in the ether
I gave you all my money, gave you all my money
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna give you nothing
'Cause you never give me nothing back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back
Please don't try to find me through my dealer
He won't pick up his phone
Please don't try my doctor either
He won't take any calls
He's no fucking spirit healer
He just can't stop to talk
But he's gone now for the weekend
I gave you all my money, gave you all my money
Gave you all my money, gave you all my money
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna give you nothing
'Cause you never give me nothing back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back
Why can't you be good for something?

48,Lenfer,Stromae,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/stromae/lenfer-chords-4023193,"   J'suis pas tout seul à être tout seul
Ça fait d'jà ça d'moins dans la tête
Et si j'comptais combien on est
Beaucoup
Tout ce à quoi j'ai d'jà pensé
Dire que plein d'autres y ont d'jà pensé
Mais malgré tout, je m'sens tout seul
Du coup
J'ai parfois eu des pensées suicidaires
Et j'en suis peu fier
On croit parfois que c'est
la seule manière de les faire taire
Ces pensées qui me font vivre un enfer
Ces pensées qui me font vivre un enfer
   Est-c'qu'y a que moi qui ai la télé
Et la chaîne culpabilité ?
Mais faut bien s'changer les idées
  Pas trop quand même
Sinon ça r'part vite dans la tête
Et c'est trop tard pour qu'ça s'arrête
C'est là qu'j'aimerais tout oublier
Du coup
J'ai parfois eu des pensées suicidaires
Et j'en suis peu fier
On croit parfois que c'est
la seule manière de les faire taire
Ces pensées qui me font vivre un enfer
Ces pensées qui me font vivre un enfer
  Tu sais j'ai mûrement réfléchi
Et je sais vraiment pas quoi faire de toi
Justement, réfléchir
C'est bien l'problème avec toi
Tu sais j'ai mûrement réfléchi
Et je sais vraiment pas quoi faire de toi
Justement, réfléchir
C'est bien l'probleme avec toi

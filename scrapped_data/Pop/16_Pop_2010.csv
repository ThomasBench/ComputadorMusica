0,Something Holy,Alice Phoebe Lou,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/alice-phoebe-lou/something-holy-chords-2533548,"No rules, no rules
You said there were no rules
Your eyes familiar whirlpools
The doors right into you
And I’ll let you in no need to ask
I wanna bask in your everything
My chest exploding my mind eroding
At the thought of you existing
Carved from the same tree made of the same stuff
I couldn’t even bluff
No flirting, no skirting on the edge
You were one with me already
All you had to do was see me
Really see me
Recognize the workings of my mind
And then touch me
Like something holy
And then touch me
Like something that is now but could never be.
And as you take a vow to never lie to me
All of my senses are screaming at me
My body one big lump of tingling, ah
Imagining you naked in front of me
Nothing to hide, just someone to hold
And then we let go
‘Cause we always let go
All you had to do was see me
Really see me
Recognize the workings of my mind
And then touch me
Like something holy
And then touch me
Like something that is now but could never be.
Like something holy
And then touch me
Like something that is now but could never be.
Wrapped up in the golden light of my bedroom
You take one look at me and I swoon
I’m here with you
It hasn’t been so easy being lonely
Oh, I’m here with you
It hasn’t been so easy being lonely
Oh, I’m here with you
It hasn’t been so easy being lonely
Oh, I’m here with you
It hasn’t been so easy being lonely
Thank you for showing me (ooh)
That I’m not alone
Thank you for showing me (ooh)
That I’m not alone
Thank you for showing me (ooh)
That I’m not alone
Thank you for showing me (ooh)
That I’m not alone.

Check your footing, don't get caught up in the rip

I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold on to you
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling

Who could stay?

You could stay...

Ooh-ah, soon you'll get better

All strung out on coke 
You said it's not funny 
But it wasn't a joke
And you won't remember 
But I carried you home 
You sat in the shower 
While I washed off your clothes
But isn't that what friends are for
Even if we used to be more?
Like lovers or partners in crime
And you were still mine
You said we should get out
While we still could 
And I shoulda listened 
But I misunderstood 
Thought you wanted me tied down 
I started to chafe 
But it's easy to see now
You just wanted me safe
And when the cops broke down our door
And held us both against our floor
Did we look like lovers or partners in crime?
Did you look like mine?
Or did we look like fools
Tryna get away with it all?
Thinkin' we'd be saved by a call
For each other
We were on the same boat
Didn't see you for ages
Didn't pick up your phone 
Made it out of our cages 
Never made it back home 
I was late to the party 
Of an old family friend 
I was lookin' for parkin'
Thought I saw you again
Someone I've seen before
You couldn't look any more like a lover
Or a partner in crime
Or something of mine

Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you till we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's overgone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
Cause honey your soul can never grow old       It's ever green
Baby your smile forever in my mind and memory 
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart

 Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
 And syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
 He's still dead when you're done with the bottle
 Of course it's a corpse that you keep in the cradle
 Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
 Syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
 Sippy cup, s-s-sippy cup, in a sippy cup, sippy cup
 In a sippy cup, in a sippy cup, in a sippy cup, in a sippy cup
 Pill diet, pill diet, if they give you a new pill then you will buy it
 If they say to kill yourself, then you will try it
 All the makeup in the world, won't make you less insecure
 You got weights in your pockets, when you go to the doctor's
 Your favorite candy's cotton, that's why all your teeth are rotten
 Silly girl, we're silly, boys
 Blood still stains when the sheets are washed
 Sex don't sleep when the lights are off
 Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
 And syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
 He's still dead when you're done with the bottle
 Of course it's a corpse that you keep in the cradle
 Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
 Syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
 Sippy cup, s-s-sippy cup, in a sippy cup, sippy cup
 In a sippy cup, in a sippy cup, in a sippy cup, in a sippy cup
 Blood still stains when the sheets are washed
 Sex don't sleep when the lights are off
 Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
 And syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
Round and round like a horse on a carousel, we go
Will I catch up to love, I could never tell, I know
Chasing after you is like a fairytale, but I
Feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
Come, come one, come all, you must be this tall
To ride this ride at the carnival
Oh, come take my hand, and run through playland
So high, too high at the carnival
And it’s all fun and games, 'til somebody falls in love
But you've already bought a ticket, and there’s no turning back now
Round and round like a horse on a carousel, we go
Will I catch up to love, I could never tell, I know
Chasing after you is like a fairytale, but I
Feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
This horse is too slow, we’re always this close
Almost, almost, we’re a freakshow
Right, right when I’m near, it’s like you disappear
Where’d you go, is that Houdini or a freakshow
And it’s all fun and games, 'til somebody falls in love
But you've already bought a ticket, and there’s no turning back now
Round and round like a horse on a carousel, we go
Will I catch up to love, I could never tell, I know
Chasing after you is like a fairytale, but I
Feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
Why did you steal my cotton candy heart
You threw it in this damn coin slot
And now I’m stuck, I'm stuck
Riding, riding, riding
Round and round like a horse on a carousel, we go
Will I catch up to love, I could never tell, I know
Chasing after you is like a fairytale, but I
Feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
You're always aiming paper airplanes at me when you're around
You build me up like building blocks just so you can bring me down
You can crush my candy cane but you'll never catch me cry
If you dangle that diploma and I deck you, don't be surprised
I know my ABC's, yet you keep teaching me
I say, fuck your degree, alphabet boy
You think you're smarter than me with all your bad poetry
Fuck all your ABC's, alphabet boy
I'm not a little kid now
Watch me get big now
Spell my name on the fridge now
With all your alphabet toys
You won the spelling bee now
But are you smarter than me now?
You're the prince of the playground
Little alphabet boy
Apples aren't an always appropriate apologies
Butterscotch and bubblegum drops are bittersweet to me
You call me a child while you keep counting all your coins
But you're not my daddy and I'm not your dolly
And your dictionary's destroyed
I know my ABC's, yet you keep teaching me
I say, fuck your degree, alphabet boy
You think you're smarter than me with all your bad poetry
Fuck all your ABC's, alphabet boy
I'm not a little kid now
Watch me get big now
Spell my name on the fridge now
With all your alphabet toys
You won the spelling bee now
But are you smarter than me now?
You're the prince of the playground
Little alphabet boy

  Think I just remembered something
  I think I left the faucet running
   Now my words are filling up the tub
  Darling you're just soaking in it
  But I know you'll get out the minute
  You notice all your fingers 
pruning up
I'm tired of being careful, tip-toe, 
trying to keep the water warm
Let me under your skin
Uh oh there it goes, I said too much, it overflowed
Why do I always spill?
  I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
  God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap
  Think I got myself in trouble
  So I fill the bath with bubbles
  Then I'll put the towels all away
  Should've never said the word ""love""
  Threw a toaster in the bathtub
  I'm sick of all the games 
I have to play
I'm tired of being careful, tip-toe,
trying to keep the water warm
Let me under your skin
Uh oh there it goes, I said too much, it overflowed
Why do I always spill?
  I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
  God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap
Riding down, riding down
My hand on your seat
I carry band-aids on me now
For when your soft hands hit the jagged ground
Wheels aren't even touching the ground
Scared to take them off but they're so warm now
Promise I won't push you straight to the dirt
If you promise me you'll take them off first
I love everything you do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you  
I love everything you do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you  
Letting go, letting go
Telling you things you already know
I explode, I explode
Asking you where you want us to go
You've been riding two wheelers all your life
It's not like I'm asking to be your wife
I wanna make you mine, but that's hard to say
Is this coming off in a cheesy way?
I love everything you do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you  
I love everything you do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you  
I love everything you do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you  
I love everything you do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you
Did my invitations disappear
Why'd I put my heart on every cursive letter?
Tell me why the hell no one is here
Tell me what to do to make it all feel better
Maybe it's a cruel joke on me
Whatever, whatever
Just means there's way more cake for me
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
Maybe if I knew all of them well
I wouldn't have been trapped inside this hell that holds me
Maybe if I casted out a spell
But told them decorations were in pastel ribbons
Maybe it's a cruel joke on me
Whatever, whatever
Just means there's way more cake for me
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
I'm laughing, I'm crying
It feels like I'm dying
I'm laughing, I'm crying
It feels like I'm dying
I'm laughing, I'm crying
It feels like I'm dying
I'm dying, I'm dying
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
It's my party, it's-it's my party
It's my party, it's-it's my party
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
Looking at me through your window
Boy, you had your eye out for a little
""I'll cut you up and make you dinner
You've reached the end, you are the winner""
Rolling down your tinted window
Driving next to me real slow, he said
""Let me take you for a joyride
I've got some candy for you inside""
Running through the parking lot
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Grabbed my hand, pushed me down
Took the words right out my mouth
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Can anybody hear me? I'm hidden under ground
Can anybody hear me? Am I talking to myself?
Saying, ""tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it""
He's saying, ""tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it""
Little bit of poison in me
I can taste your skin in my teeth
""I love it when I hear you breathing
I hope to God you're never leaving""
Running through the parking lot
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Grabbed my hand, pushed me down
Took the words right out my mouth
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Can anybody hear me? I'm hidden under ground
Can anybody hear me? Am I talking to myself?
Saying, ""tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it""
He's saying, ""tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it""
Eenie meenie miny mo
Get your lady by her toes
If she screams, don't let her go
Eenie meenie miny mo
Your mother said to pick the very best girl
And I am
Running through the parking lot
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Grabbed my hand, pushed me down
Took the words right out my mouth
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Can anybody hear me? I'm hidden under ground
Can anybody hear me? Am I talking to myself?
Saying, ""tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it""
He's saying, ""tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it""
1,  2,   melatonin is coming for you
3,  4,   baby, won't you lock the door?
5,  6,   I'm done with it
7,  8, it's getting late, so close your eyes, sleep for days
 Hush, little baby, drink your spoiled milk
 I'm fucking crazy, need my prescription filled
 Do you like my cookies? They're made just for you
A little bit of sugar, but lots of poison, too
Ashes, ashes, time to go down
  Ooh, honey do you want me now?
  Can't take it anymore, need to put you to bed
  Sing you a lullaby where you die at the end
9,  10,   never want to see you again
11,  12,   I pull off black so well
Shit behind the curtain that I'm sick of sugarcoatin'
Next time you're alone, think fast when you grab the phone
Ashes, ashes, time to go down
  Ooh, honey do you want me now?
  Can't take it anymore, need to put you to bed
  Sing you a lullaby where you die at the end
Ashes, ashes, time to go down
  Ooh, honey do you want me now?
  Can't take it anymore, need to put you to bed
  Sing you a lullaby where you die at the end
Tired, blue boy walks my way
Holding a girls hand
That basic bitch leaves finally
Now I can take her man
  Someone told me stay away from things that aren’t yours
But was it yours, if he wanted me so bad?
  Pacify her
She’s getting on my nerves
Stop lying with those words 
  Pacify her
She’s getting on my nerves
Stop lying with those words
I can’t stand her whining
Where’s her binky now?
And loving her seems tiring
So boy, just love me, down, down, down
  Someone told me stay away from things that aren’t yours
But was it yours, if he wanted me so bad?
  Pacify her
She’s getting on my nerves
Stop lying with those words 
  Pacify her
She’s getting on my nerves
Stop lying with those words
  Pacify her
She’s getting on my nerves
  Pacify her
She’s getting on my nerves
Stop lying with those words 
  Pacify her
She’s getting on my nerves
Stop lying with those words
If you weren't born with it
You can buy a couple ornaments
Just be sure to read the warning, kids
Cause pretty soon you'll be bored of it
Sexual, hey girl if you wanna feel sexual
You can always call up a professional
They stick pins in you like a vegetable
Kids forever, kids forever
Baby soft skin turns into leather
Don't be dramatic it's only some plastic
  Oh Mrs. Potato Head tell me, 
  is it true that pain is beauty?
  Does a new face come with a warranty?
  Will a pretty face make it better?
  Oh Mr. Potato Head tell me
  How did you afford her surgery?
  Do you swear you'll stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
       Even if her face don't stay together
If you want a little more confidence
Potatoes turn to french fries, yeah it's common sense
All you need's a couple more condiments
And a hundred thousand dollars for some compliments
It's such a waste
When little girls grow into their mothers face
But little girls are learning how to cut and paste
And pucker up their lips until they suffocate
Kids forever, kids forever
Baby soft skin turns into leather
Don't be dramatic it's only some plastic
  Oh Mrs. Potato Head tell me, 
  is it true that pain is beauty?
  Does a new face come with a warranty?
  Will a pretty face make it better?
  Oh Mr. Potato Head tell me
  How did you afford her surgery?
  Do you swear you'll stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
  Oh Mrs. Potato Head tell me, 
  is it true that pain is beauty?
  Does a new face come with a warranty?
  Will a pretty face make it better?
  Oh Mr. Potato Head tell me
  How did you afford her surgery?
  Do you swear you'll stay forever
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
My friends don't walk they run
Skinny dip in rabbit holes for fun
Poppin' poppin' balloons with guns
Getting high off helium
We paint white roses red
Each shade from a different persons head
This dream dream is a killer
Getting drunk with the blue caterpillar
Now I'm peeling the skin off my face
Cause I really hate being safe
The normals they make me afraid
The crazy they make me feel sane
I'm nuts!
Baby, I'm mad
Craziest friend that you've ever had
You think I'm psycho
You think I'm gone
Tell the psychiatrist something is wrong
Over the bend
Entirely bonkers
You like me best when I'm off my rocker
Tell you a secret
I'm not alarmed
So what if I'm crazy?
The best people are
All the best people are crazy
All the best people are
Where is my prescription?
Doctor, doctor please listen
My brain is scattered
You can be Alice,
I'll be the mad hatter.
Now I'm peeling the skin off my face
Cause I really hate being safe
The normals they make me afraid
The crazy they make me feel sane
I'm nuts!
Baby, I'm mad
Craziest friend that you've ever had
You think I'm psycho
You think I'm gone
Tell the psychiatrist something is wrong
Over the bend
Entirely bonkers
You like me best when I'm off my rocker
Tell you a secret
I'm not alarmed
So what if I'm crazy?
The best people are
You think I'm crazy, you think I'm gone
So what if I'm crazy? All the best people are
And I think you're crazy too, I know you're gone
That's probably the reason that we get along
Now I'm peeling the skin off my face
Cause I really hate being safe
The normals they make me afraid
The crazy they make me feel sane
I'm nuts!
Baby, I'm mad
Craziest friend that you've ever had
You think I'm psycho
You think I'm gone
Tell the psychiatrist something is wrong
Over the bend
Entirely bonkers
You like me best when I'm off my rocker
Tell you a secret
I'm not alarmed
So what if I'm crazy?
The best people are
All the best people are crazy
All the best people are.
You call me on the telephone, you feel so far away
You tell me to come over there some games you want to play
I'm walking to your house, nobody's home
Its me and you, you and me alone
We're just playing hide and seek
It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
I don't wanna play no games
I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you
I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I give a shit 'bout you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you
Wake up in your bedroom and there's nothing left to say
When I try to talk you're always playing board games
I wish I had monopoly over your mind
I wish I didn't care all the time
We're just playing hide and seek
It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
I don't wanna play no games
I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you
I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I give a shit 'bout you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you
Ring around the rosy
I never know, I never know what you need
Ring around the rosy, I wanna give you, wanna give you
I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I give a shit 'bout you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you
You know I give a fuck about you every day
Guess it's time that I tell you the truth
If I share my toys, will you let me stay?
Don't wanna leave this play date with you
  Stitched you up, put you together
With cotton and feather
  Gave you love, put my heart inside you
Oh what could I do
When you started talking in your sleep
Saying things you'd do to me
I didn't care
Now I'm finding knives under the sheets
Crumbled photographs of me
I'm in despair
Teddy bear, you are my teddy bear
You were comforting and quiet
How did love become so violent?
Oh, teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
Everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me
  I threw you out, I didn't outgrow you
I just didn't know you
  But now you're back
And it's so terrifying how you paralyze me
Now you showing up inside my home
Breathing deep into the phone
I'm so unprepared
Teddy bear, you are my teddy bear
You were comforting and quiet
How did love become so violent?
Oh, teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
Everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me
I'm fucking scared
Teddy bear, you are my teddy bear
You were comforting and quiet
How did love become so violent?
Oh, teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
Everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me

Your skin is warm like an oven
Your kiss is sugary sweet
Your fingers feel like cotton
When you put your arms around me
It feels like I'm just missing
Something whenever you leave
We've got all the ingredients
Except you loving me
 And respectfully
I'm not a piece of cake
For you to just discard
While you walk away
With the frosting of my heart
So I'm taking back
What's mine, you'll miss
The slice of heaven that
I gave to you last night
You smell just like vanilla
You taste like buttercream
You're filling up my senses
With empty calories
It feels like I'm just missing
Something whenever you leave
We've got all the ingredients
Except you needing me
 And respectfully
I'm not a piece of cake
For you to just discard
While you walk away
With the frosting of my heart
So I'm taking back
What's mine, you'll miss
The slice of heaven that
I gave to you last night
If I am just a piece of cake
I am just a piece of cake
Then, you're just a piece of meat
You're just a piece of meat to me
I'm not a piece of cake
For you to just discard
While you walk away
With the frosting of my heart
So I'm taking back
What's mine, you'll miss
The slice of heaven that
I gave to you last night
The slice of heaven that I gave
S-S-Slice of heaven that I gave to you
The Slice of heaven
That I gave to you
Last night

0,Hope Is A Dangerous Thing For A Woman Like Me To Have - But I Have It,Lana Del Rey,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lana-del-rey/hope-is-a-dangerous-thing-for-a-woman-like-me-to-have-but-i-have-it-chords-2569023,"I was reading Slim Aarons and I got to thinking that I thought
Maybe I'd get less stressed if I was tested less like all of these debutantes
Smiling for miles in pink dresses and high heels on white yachts
But I'm not, baby I'm not
No, I'm not that, I'm not
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown, twenty-four seven, Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on the walls 'cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad
Don't ask if I'm happy, you know that I'm not, but at best I can say I'm not sad
'Cause hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
I had fifteen-year dances, church basement romances, yeah I've cried
Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums is the only love I've ever known
Except for the stage which I also call home when I'm not
Servin' up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
Hello, it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad
Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, ""Hi, Dad""
I've been tearing up town in my fucking white gown like a goddamn near sociopath
Shaking my ass is the only thing that's got this black narcissist off my back
She couldn't care less and I never cared more so there's no more to say about that
Except hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past
There's a new revolution, a loud evolution that I saw
Born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly I've known
A modern day woman with a weak constitution 'cause I've got
Monsters still under my bed that I could never fight off
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown, twenty-four seven, Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on your walls 'cause the ink in my pen don't look good in my pad
They write that I'm happy, they know that I'm not but at best, you can see I'm not sad
But hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
But I have it, yeah I have it
Yeah, I have it, I have

Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel-Air now 
Hot summer nights mid July 
When you and I were forever wild 
The crazy days, the city lights 
The way you'd play with me like a child 
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful 
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul 
I know you will, I know you will 
I know that you will 
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful

Channeling angels in, the new age now 
Hot summer days, rock and roll

And all the ways I got to know 
Your pretty face and electric soul

Please let me bring my man 
When he comes tell me that you'll let me 
Father tell me if you can

Oh that face makes me wanna party

Eats us alive, oh it eats us alive

We hold on so tight, but I don't wanna die, no

     Il est où ?
Il est où le bonheur, il est où ?
     Il est où ?
J'ai fait l'amour, j'ai fait la manche
J'attendais d'être heureux
J'ai fait des chansons, j'ai fait des enfants
J'ai fait au mieux
J'ai fait la gueule, j'ai fait semblant
On fait comme on peut
J'ai fait le con, c'est vrai ; j'ai fait la fête, ouais !
Je croyais être heureux
Mais,
y a tous ces soirs sans potes
Quand personne sonne et ne vient
C'est dimanche soir, dans la flotte
Comme un con dans son bain
Essayant de le noyer, mais il flotte
Ce putain de chagrin
Alors, je me chante mes plus belles notes
Et ça ira mieux demain
Il est où le bonheur, il est où ?
     Il est où ?
Il est où le bonheur, il est où ?
     Il est où ?
Il est là le bonheur, il est là !
      Il est là !
Il est là le bonheur, il est là !
      Il est là !
J'ai fait la cour, j'ai fait mon cirque
J'attendais d'être heureux
J'ai fait le clown, c'est vrai et j'ai rien fait
Mais ça ne va pas mieux
J'ai fait du bien, j'ai fait des fautes
On fait comme on peut
J'ai fait des folies, j'ai pris des fous rires, ouais
Je croyais être heureux
y a tous ces soirs de Noël, où l'on sourit poliment
Pour protéger de la vie cruelle
Tous ces rires d'enfants
Et ces chaises vides qui nous rappellent
Ce que la vie nous prend
Alors, je me chante mes notes les plus belles
C'était mieux avant
Il est où le bonheur, il est où ?
     Il est où ?
Il est où le bonheur, il est où ?
     Il est où ?
Il est là le bonheur, il est là !
      Il est là !
Il est là le bonheur, il est là !
      Il est là !
C'est une bougie, le bonheur
Ris pas trop fort d'ailleurs
Tu risques de l'éteindre
On l'veut le bonheur, on l'veut, ouais !
Tout le monde veut l'atteindre
non, il fait pas de bruit
Non, il n'en fait pas
C'est con le bonheur, ouais, car c'est souvent après qu'on sait qu'il était là
Il est où le bonheur, il est où ?
     Il est où ?
Il est où le bonheur, il est où ?
     Il est où ?
Il est là le bonheur, il est là !

Cause sooner or later
We'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows
Almost, almost is never enough

The way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each others arms

There'd be no such thing as goodbye

      Not what you'd think,  and if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare, to anyone who might care
      Thought I could fly (fly, fly, fly),   so I stepped off the Golden, mm
      Nobody cried (cried, cried, cried),  nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there, kinda thought they might care
      I had a dream,   I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up I see, you with me
And you say, ""As long as I'm here,   no one can hurt you""
      Don't wanna lie here,   but you can learn to
      If I could change the way that you see yourself
      You wouldn't wonder why you hear,  ""They don't deserve you""
      I tried to scream,   but my head was underwater
      They called me weak,  like I'm not just somebody's daughter
It coulda been a nightmare, but it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago, but I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now, and I don't wanna let 'em down
      I had a dream,   I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up I see, you with me
And you say, ""As long as I'm here,   no one can hurt you""

Lost but now I am found
I can see but once I was blind

Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut
Ahhh ahhh ahhh ah ah – ahhh ahhh ahhh ah ah
Do you know where the wild things go
They go along to take your honey - la la la la
Break down let’s sleep build up breakfast now
Let’s eat my love my love love love - la la la la
She bruises coughs she splutters pistol shots
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
She’s morphine queen of my vaccine my love my love love love - la la la la
Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
The fear has gripped me but here I go
My heart sinks as I jump up
Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut
And ahhh ahhh ahhh ah ah – ahhh ahhh ahhh ah ah
Ahhh ahhh ahhh ah ah – ahhh ahhh ahhh ah ah
She may contain the urge to runaway
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
Germaline disinfect the scene my love my love love love
But please don’t go I love you so..

Please don’t go, please don’t go, I love you so, I love you so

But please don’t go I love you so..

I listen to the strings buzz
The metal vibrates underneath your fingers
And when you crochet
I feel mesmerized and proud
And I would say I love you

So I won't say it at all
And I won't stay very long

I think of you as my brother

And words are futile devices

You could leave the world and feel like you've achieved the things you hoped to do but
Honestly I don't feel ordinary cause I haven't been at home in a while
Tell them that it's only temporary
I'm trying my best to smile
But that's never enough
Cause when you lose the ones you love
You might find it hard to cry
Until it's only you and everybody else has left the room
You might feel what it's like to not know how to feel
You see, my old lady's old man just now left
And there's nothing i can say except this long awaited rest
Is a good thing and all good things must come to an end
It's right in front of me so there's no reason to pretend Except I'm afraid to die
If this were a movie, you'd be taking our kids to school
And I'd be Channing Tatum or somebody sexy
Somebody cool

Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say ""which one?"" I say, ""nah, I want all 'em""

When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, give me the loot
Look at my neck, look at my jet, ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set, if I like it, then that's what I get, yeah
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (yeah)

  And I miss the bar where the Beach Boys would go
   Dennis's last stop before Kokomo
   Those nights were on fire, we couldn't get higher
We didn't know that we had it  all
But nobody warns you before the fall

I'm fa-a-a-a--cing the greatest
      The greatest loss of them all
   The culture is lit and I had a ball
   I guess I'm signing off after all
  I miss New York and I miss the music
   Me and my friends‚ we miss rock 'n' roll
  I want shit to feel just like it used to
When baby, I was doing nothing the most of all
   The culture is lit and if this is it
I had a ba-a-a-a---a---all

Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you all it does is just tear me down
Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
It all just sounds like ooh, ooh, oooh, oooh
Mmm too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing, but she's dancing with another man
My pride, my ego, my needs and selfish ways
Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made ooh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like ooh, ooh, oooh, oooh
Mmm too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers and held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing, but she's dancing with another man
Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours when he has the chance
Take you to every party cause I remember how much you love to dance
Do all the things I should've done when I was your man
Do all the things I should've done when I was your man

43,All Too Well (ver 2),Taylor Swift,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/taylor-swift/all-too-well-chords-1190459," I walked through the door with you 
 The air was cold
 But something about it felt like home somehow
 And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
 And you still got it in your drawer even now
 Oh your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
 We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
 Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
 And I can picture it after all these days
 And I know it's long gone
 And that magic's not here no more
 And I might be okay
 But I'm not fine at all
 Cause there we are again on that little town street
 You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me
 Wind in my hair I was there I remember it all too well
 Photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red
 You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-size bed
 Your mother's telling stories about you on the tee ball team
 You tell me about your past thinking your future was me
 And I know it's long gone
 And there was nothing else I could do
 And I forget about you long enough
 To forget why I needed to
 Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
 We're dancing around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
 Down the stairs I was there I remember it all to well
 And maybe we got lost in translation maybe I asked for too much
 But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
 Running scared I was there I remember it all too well
 And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
 So casually cruel in the name of being honest
 I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
 Cause I remember it all all all too well
 Time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
 I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
 After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
 Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
 But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
 Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
 You cant get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well yeah
 Cause there we are again when I loved you so
 Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
 It was rare I was there I remember it all too well
 Wind in my hair you were there you remember it all
 Down the stairs you were there you remember it all
 It was rare I was there I remember it all too well

0,Roller Skating Child,The Beach Boys,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-beach-boys/roller-skating-child-chords-2262297,"Well she's a roller skating child with a ribbon in her hair
She gets my heart to beating when I see her there
  You know my heart starts smiling when she sings
     She's such an angel I bet she's got wings
And we'll make sweet lovin' when the sun goes down
We'll even do more when your mama's not around
Well oh my oh gosh oh gee
She really sends chills inside of me
They've got a record playing in the skatin' rink
She comes skatin' past me and she gives me a wink
I go and get my skates on and I catch up with her
We do it holdin' hands it's so cold I go ""brrr""
And we'll make sweet lovin' when the sun goes down
We'll even do more when your mama's not around
Well oh my oh gosh oh gee
She really sends chills inside of me
Round and around and around we go
The music keeps me on my feet
It's sweet it's sweet it's sweeter than honey
When we're walkin' down the street
We run in to the kitchen and we grab a bite
Her folks let me stay with her 'til late at night
 So many guys want a girl like mine
     A love like this happens only one time
And we'll make sweet lovin' when the sun goes down
We'll even do more when your mama's not around
Well oh my oh gosh oh gee
She really sends chills inside of me

The autumn leaves   of red and gold
I see your lips,     the summer kisses
The sunburnt hands    I used to hold
Since you went away    the days grow long
And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you   most of all   my darling
When autumn leaves       start to fall
C'est une chanson      qui nous ressemble
Toi, tu m'aimais      et je t'aimais
Nous vivions tous     les deux ensemble
Toi qui m'aimais      moi qui t'aimais
Mais la vie sépare   ceux qui s'aiment
Tout doucement   sans faire de bruit
Et la mer efface   sur le sable
Les pas  des amants   désunis.

   A drum that echoes through a world that once was still
   Gone with the morning
   Where did the feeling go?
What was here is here no more
We are shadows of the night before
   Two daytime strangers wake a long way from the night
   We couldn't make the journey from the dark to light
   Gone with the morning
   What happens I don't know
The bed is warm where we have slept
Sunshine came and we were swept away
We are only victims of the day
   Gone with the morning
   Where did the feeling go?
What was here is here no more
We are shadows of the night before
I wish I knew why love just fades away and dies
Like stars that live by night and tumble from the skies
   Chased by the dawning
   Gone with the morning light
Where did the feeling go?
Just what happened I don't know
The song refused to linger on
Love was here, but now     love is gone
   With the morning

And gets up again       At the count of ten - I would like everyone here to repeat after me
Something of which I know nothing about
Namely that which I will tell you        - (That which I will tell you)
I'm going to school breaking a rule -I'm going around in a pityful frown
'Coz I didn't pass (came) - Bottom of the class (Oh! what a shame)
Teacher was mad -So was me dad -Took off his belt -And without any help
Really hit me hard - Where I'd stuck a card - Thick I may be but a fool I am certainly not -
Always remember the golden rule
When in no doubt get a car out - And while you're there how about...
Fetching me one of those pneumatic drills
Boy! I really love the sound that they make
So good for the pains and aches of life in general - Don't be such a miser
At the most a fiver's all you pay

I want you all to repeat after me
Something I know you know I know - (Something I know you know I know)
I wouldn't behold wouldn't be cold - I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for my
Dear old mum and dad - And the fun they had
Early one night - Dad put out the light - Got hold of me mum - Said he wanted a son
And as you can see - The result was me
Somebody told me once money does not grow on trees
Well if that's true then how do you explain
Apples oranges and lemons - Not forgetting melons

22,The Kick Inside Album,Kate Bush,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/kate-bush/the-kick-inside-chords-753551," Moving, stranger, does it really matter?
 As long as you're not afraid to feel.
 Touch me, hold me, how my open arms ache.
 Try to fall for me.
 How I'm moved, how you move me.
 With your beauty's po-tency...
 You give me life; please don't let me go.
 You crush the lily in my so...ul, so...ul,
 So...ul...
 Moving liquid; yes, you are just water.
 You flow around, all that comes in your way.
 Don't think it over; it always takes you over.
 And sets your spirit dancing.
 How I'm moved, how you move me.
 With your beauty's po-tency...
 You give me life; please don't let me go,
 You give me life; please don't let me go.
 Oh, you give me life; please don't let me go.
 You crush the lily in my so...ul, so...ul,
 So...ul...
 You'll find me in a Berlin bar, in a corner, brooding.
 You know that I go very quiet, when I'm listening to you.
There's something special in-deed, there's something special in-deed.
 In all the places where I've seen you shine, boy,
 There's something very real in how I feel, honey.
It's in me, it's in me-e.
And you know it's for real.
 Tuning in on your... saxo-phone.
 Doo-bee, doo-bee-doo... ooh   -ooh.
 The candle burning over your shoulder,     is throwing;
 Shadows from your saxophone; a surly lady in tremor.
The stars that climb from her bowels, those stars make towers on vowels.
 You'll never see, that you had all of me,
 You'll never know the poet-ry you've stirred in me.
 Of all the stars I've seen, that shine so brightly,
 I've never known, or felt in myself, so rightly.
It's in me, it's in me-e.
And you know it's for real.
 Tuning in on your... saxo-phone.
 Doo-bee, doo-bee-doo... ooh   -ooh.
 Soon it will be the phase of the moon, when people tune in.
 Every girl knows about the punctual blues,
But who's to know the power, behind our moves?
 A day of coincidence, with the radio,
 We know what they're all going to say;
 ""G"" arrives, funny; had a feeling he was on his way.
We raise our hats to the strange phe-nomena,
 Soul birds of a feather, flock together.
We raise out hats to the hand a-moulding us,
 Sure 'nuf, he has the an-swer.
He has the an-swer, he has the an-swer.
 Om mani padme, om mani padme, om mani padme hum.
You pick up a paper, you read a name,
You go out; it turns up, again and again.
You bump into a friend you haven't seen for a long time,
 Then into a-nother, you only thought about last night.
 You hear your sister, calling for you,
 You know there's something wrong,
But you don't want to believe in a premonition.
We raise our hats to the strange phe-nomena,
 Soul birds of a feather, flock together.
We raise out hats to the hand a-moulding us,
 Sure 'nuf, he has the an-swer.
He has the an-swer, he has the an-swer.
 Om mani padme, om mani padme, om mani padme hum.
 Come up and be a kite.
 Beelzebub is aching in my belly-o,
 My feet are heavy and I'm rooting in my wellios.
And I want to get away and go, from all these mirror windows.
 I look at eye level; it isn't good enough,
 And then I find out, when I take a good look up.
There's a hole in the sky, with a big eyeball calling me.
 Come up and be a kite,
 And fly a diamond night.
A di...iamond kite, a di...iamond kite.
 Ooh, what a diamond!
A diamond kite, on a diamond flight.
 Over the lights, under the moon,
 Over the lights, under the moon.
 Over the moon, over the moon.
 Come up and be a kite.
 I feel a rush a-long my body, like a bullet,
 I'm 2D, af-ter a push and pull feeling.
And I want to get back to safe home, I love the homeland dome.
 I got no limbs; I'm like a feather on the wind,
 Well I'm not sure, if I want to be up here at all.
And I'd like to be back on the ground, but I don't know how to get down.
 Come up and be a kite,
 And fly a diamond night.
A di...iamond kite, a di...iamond kite.
 Ooh, what a diamond!
A diamond kite, on a diamond flight.
 Over the lights, under the moon,
 Over the lights, under the moon.
 Over the moon, over the moon.
 Come up and be a kite.
 Come up and be a kite.
 I hear him, before I go to sleep, and focus on the day that's been.
 I rea-lise he's there, when I turn the light off, and turn over.
 Nobody knows about my man,
 They think he's lost on some ho-rizon.
And suddenly I find myself; listening to a man, I've never known before.
 Telling me a-bout the sea, all his loves until e-ternity.
 Ooh...  he's here again,
 The man with the child in his eyes.
 Ooh...  he's here again,
 The man with the child in his eyes.
 He's very understanding, and he's so aware, of all my situ-ations.
 And when I stay up late, he's always waiting, but I feel him hesitate.
 Oh, I'm so worried about my love,
 They say; ""no, no, it won't last forever"".
And here I am a-gain, my girl; wondering what on earth I'm doing here.
 Maybe he doesn't love me; I just took a trip, on my love for him?
 Ooh...  he's here again,
 The man with the child in his eyes.
 Ooh...  he's here again,
 The man with the child in his eyes.
 Out on the winding, windy moors; we'd roll and fall in green.
 You had a temper, like my jealou-sy; too hot, too greedy.
 How could you leave me, when I needed to, possess you?
 I hated you, I loved you too.
 Bad dreams in the night,
 They told me I was going to lose the fight.
 Leave be-hind, my Wuthering, Wuthering, Wuthering Heights.
Heath-cliff,
It's me, your Cathy; I've come home and,
I'm so co-o-o-old; let me into your window-o-o-ow.
Heath-cliff,
It's me, your Cathy; I've come home and,
I'm so co-o-o-old; let me into your window-o-o-ow.
 Oh, it gets dark, it gets lonely, on the other side from you.
 I pine a lot, I find a lot, falls through with-out you.
 I'm coming back love, cruel Heathcliff,
 My one dream, my only master.
 Too long I roam in the night,
 I'm coming back to his side to put it right.
 I'm coming home, to Wuthering, Wuthering, Wuthering Heights.
Heath-cliff,
It's me, your Cathy; I've come home and,
I'm so co-o-o-old; let me into your window-o-o-ow.
Heath-cliff,
It's me, your Cathy; I've come home and,
I'm so co-o-o-old; let me into your window-o-o-ow.
 Ooh, let me have it; let me grab, your soul a-way.
 Ooh, let me have it; let me grab, your soul a-way.
 You know it's me; Ca-thy.
Heath-cliff,
It's me, your Cathy; I've come home and,
I'm so co-o-o-old; let me into your window-o-o-ow.
Heath-cliff,
It's me, your Cathy; I've come home and,
I'm so co-o-o-old,
     James, come on home.
 You've been gone too long, baby.
 We can't let our hero die a-lone.
We miss you day and night,
 You left town to live by the rifle.
 You left us to fight,
But it just ain't right, to take away the light.
 Remember Genie, from the ca-sino?
 She's still a-waiting, in that big brass bed.
 The boys from your gang, are knocking whisky back,
 'Till they get out of hand and wish they were dead.
 They're only lonely for the life that they led, with their old friends.
 Ooh...   wooh-hoo-ooh-hoo,
Wooh-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo hoo,
Wooh-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo.
 James, are you selling your soul to a cold gun?
 Where,      lies your heart?
 It's not there in the buckskin baby.
 It's not there in the gin,
That makes you laugh long and loud.
You're a coward, James;
 You're running a-way from humanity.
 You're running out on reality.
 It won't be funny, when they rat-a-tat-tat you down.

 Ooh...   wooh-hoo-ooh-hoo,
Wooh-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo hoo,
Wooh-hoo-hoo-hoo, hoo.
 James, are you selling your soul... to... a cold... gun?
 After, the party,
You took me back to your parlour; a little nervous laughter.
 Locking the door, my stockings fall on the floor.
Desperate for more.
 Nobody else can share this; here comes one and one,
And one makes one, makes one the glorious union.
 Well, it could be love, or it could be just lust.
 But it will be fun, it will be...
 Wonderful...
 Oh feel it, oh, oh, feel it, feel it my love.
 Oh feel it, oh, oh, feel it, feel it my love.
 Oh I need it, oh, oh, feel it, feel it my love.
 Feel it.
 See what you're do-ing to me,
 See what you're do-ing to me.
 God, but you're beautiful, aren't you?
 Feel your warm hand, walking around; I won't pull away.
 My passion always wins, so keep on a-moving in.
 Keep on tuning in, synchronise...
 Rhythm now.
 Oh feel it, oh, oh, feel it, feel it my love.
 Oh feel it, oh, oh, feel it, feel it my love.
 Oh I need it, oh, oh, feel it, feel it my love.
 Feel it.
 See what you're do-ing to me,
 See what you're do-ing to me.
 As the light hits you,
 As you shift a-long the floor.
 I find it hard to place my face.
 How did I come to be here anyway?
 It's terribly vague; what's gone before.
 I could have been anyone,
 You could have been any-one's dream.
 Why did you have to choose our moment?
 Why did you have to make me feel that?
 Why did you make it so unreal?
 Oh! to be in love, and never get out again,
 Oh! to be in love, and never get out again.
 Oh! to be in love, and never get out again.
 Oh! to be in love, and never get out again,
 Oh! to be in love, and never get out again.
 Oh! to be in love, and never get out again.
 All the colours look brighter now,
 Everything, they say seems to sound new.
 Slipping in-to tomorrow too quick,
 Yesterday always too good to forget.
 Stop the swing of the pendu-lum; let us through!
 Oh! to be in love, and never get out again,
 Oh! to be in love, and never get out again.
 Oh! to be in love, and never get out again.
 You came out of the night, wearing a mask in white colour.
 My eyes were shining on the wine, and your aura.
 All in order... we move into the boudoir.
But too soon the morning, has re-sumed.
I'm hanging on the Old Goose Moon,
You look like an angel, sleeping it off at a station.
 Were you only passing through?
I'm dying for you just to touch me,
And feel all the energy, rushing right up-at-me.
 L'amour looks something like you.
The thought of you, sends me shivering,
I'm dressed in lace, sailing down a black reverie.
 My heart is thrown, to the pebbles and the boatmen.
 All the time... I find I'm living in that evening,
With that feeling of sticky love, in-side.
I'm hanging on the Old Goose Moon,

 L'amour looks something like you,
 L'amour looks something like you...
 Rolling the ball, rolling the ball,
 Rolling the ball, to me.
 Rolling the ball, rolling the ball,
 Rolling the ball, to me.
 They arrived at an incon-venient time;
 I was hiding in a room in my mind.
 They made me look at my-self; I saw it well.
 I'd shut the people out of my life.
 So now I take the oppor-tunities;
 Wonderful teachers, ready to teach me.
 I must work on my mind, for now I rea -lise;
 Every-one of us, has a Heaven inside.
 Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot,
 Them heavy people, help me.
 Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot.
 Rolling the ball, rolling the ball,
 Rolling the ball, to me.
 Rolling the ball, rolling the ball,
 Rolling the ball, to me.
 They open doorways, that I thought were shut for good.
 They read me Gurdjieff and Jesu.
 They build up my bo-dy; break me e-motional-ly.
 It's nearly killing me; but what a lovely feeling!
 I love the whirling of the dervishes,
 I love the beauty or rare innocence.
 You don't need no crystal ball;
 Don't fall for a magic wand.
 We humans got it all; we perform the miracles.
 Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot,
 Them heavy people, help me.
 Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot.
 Rolling the, rolling the, rolling the, rolling the...
 Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot,
 Them heavy people, help me.
 Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot.
 Rolling the, rolling the, rolling the, rolling the...
 Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot,
 Them heavy people, help me.
 Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot.
 Hey there you lady in tears,
Do you think that they care, if they're real, woman?
They just take it as part of the deal.
 Lost in your men, and the games that you play.
 Trying to prove that you're better, woman.
But you needn't get heavy with them.
 Like it or not, we're built tough, because we're women.
 No, we never die for long,
 While we've got that little life to live for.
Where it's hid in-side, no,
We never die for long, oh-woman, two in one.
There's room for a life in your womb, woman.
 Inside of you, can be two, woman.
There's room for a life in your womb, woman...
 Night after night, in the quiet house,
 Plaiting her hair by the fire, woman.
With no lover to free her de-sire.
How long do you think she can stick it out?
How long do you think, before she'll go out, woman?
Hey get up on your feet and go get it now.
 Like it or not, we keep bouncing back; because we're women.
 No, we never die for long,
 While we've got that little life to live for.
Where it's hid in-side, no,
We never die for long, oh-woman, two in one.
There's room for a life in your womb, woman.
 Inside of you, can be two, woman.
There's room for a life in your womb, woman...
I've pulled down my lace and the chintz,
 Ooh, do you know, you have the face of a geni-us?
 I'll send your love to Zeus.
Oh, by the time you read this, I'll be well in touch.
 I'm giving it all in a moment or two,
 I'm giving it all in a moment for you.
 I'm giving it all, giving it, giving it, giving it.
 This kicking here inside, makes me leave you behind.
 No more under the quilt, to keep you warm.
 Your sister, I was born; you must, lose me like,
An arrow shot into the killer storm.
 You and me, on the bobbing knee,
 Didn't we cry at that old mythology he'd read?
 I will come home again,
But not un-til the sun and the moon meet on yon hill.
 I'm giving it all in a moment or two,
 I'm giving it all in a moment for you.
 I'm giving it all, giving it, giving it, giving it.
 This kicking here inside, makes me leave you behind.
 No more under the quilt, to keep you warm.
 Your sister, I was born; you must, lose me like,
An arrow shot into the killer storm.
I've pulled down my lace and the chintz,
 Ooh, do you know, you have the face of a geni-us?
 I'll send your love to Zeus.
Oh, by the time you read this...

Lights aglow and mistletoe.

Used to mean, so much to me.

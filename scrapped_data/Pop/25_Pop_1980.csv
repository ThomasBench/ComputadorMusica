2,Be Still My Beating Heart,Sting,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/sting/be-still-my-beating-heart-chords-1808817,"Be still my beating heart
It would be better to be cool
It's not time to be open just yet
A lesson once learned is so hard to forget
Be still my beating heart
I'll be taken for a fool
It's not healthy to run at this pace
The blood runs so red to my face
I've been to every single book I know
To soothe the thoughts that plague me sooooo...
I sink like a stone that's been thrown in the ocean
My logic has drowned in a sea of emotion
Stop before you start
Be still my beating heart
Be still my beating heart...
Be still my beating heart...
Be still my beating heart...
Be still my beating heart...
Restore my broken dreams
Shattered like a falling glass
I'm not ready to be broken just yet
A lesson once learned is so hard to forget
Be still my beating heart
You must learn to stand your ground
It's not healthy to run at this pace
The blood runs so red to my face
I've been to every single book I know
To soothe the thoughts that plague me sooooo...
Stop before you start
Be still my beating heart
Be still my beating heart...
Be still my beating heart...
Be still my beating heart...
Be still my beating heart...
  Never to be wrong
  Never to make promises that break
  It's like singing in the wind
  Or writing on the surface of a lake
And I wriggle like a fish caught on dry land
And I struggle to avoid any help at hand
I sink like a stone that's been thrown in the ocean
My logic has drowned in a sea of emotion
Stop before you start
Be still my beating heart
Be still my beating heart... (repeat to fade)

There were no clues, theyâre behind him

Sounding heartbeats, intimidation

4,Train In The Distance,Paul Simon,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/paul-simon/train-in-the-distance-chords-524475,"   She was beautiful as Southern skies
  The night he met her
    She was married to someone

    He was old, he was young
 From time to time he'd tip his heart
      But each time she withdrew
   Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance
      Everybody thinks it's true
   Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance
      Everybody thinks it's true
   Well eventually the boy and the girl get married
    Sure enough they have a son
   And though they both were occupied with the child she carried
    Disagreements had begun
 And in a while they       fell apart

      Everybody thinks it's true
   Everybody loves the sound of a train in the distance
      Everybody thinks it's true

     Two people playing the game
   Negotiations and love songs
Are often mistaken for    one and the same
   Now the man and the woman remain in contact
    Let us say it's for the child
   With disagreements about the meaning
Of a marriage contract

That youre the one for me

Just hold me baby and im in ecstasy
Oh Ill be workin from nine to five
To buy you things to keep you by my side
I never felt so in love before
Just promise baby, youll love me forevermore
I swear Im keepin you satisfied

I know I'll find you somehow 
And somehow I'll return again to you
The mist is lifting slowly I can see the way ahead
And I've left behind the empty streets that once inspired my life
And the strength of the emotion is like thunder in the air
'Cos the promise that we made each other haunts me to the end
I know you're out there somewhere somewhere somewhere
I know you're out there somewhere somewhere you can hear my voice
I know I'll find you somehow somehow somehow
I know I'll find you somehow and somehow I'll return again to you

I've been searching for in everyone I meet
And the times I've been mistaken it's impossible to say
And the grass is growing under neath our feet

O yes I know I'll find you somehow

That there's none so blind as those who will not see
And to those who lack the courage and say it's dangerous to try
Well they just don't know that love eternal will not be denied

I know you're out there somewhere somewhere you can hear my voice
I know I'll find you somehow somehow somehow
I know I'll find you somehow and somehow I'll return again to you
Yes I know it's going to happen I can feel you getting near
And soon we'll be returning to the fountain of our youth
And if you wake up wondering in the darkness I'll be there
My arms will close around you and protect you with the truth

I know you're out there somewhere somewhere you can hear my voice

kan bryta ner varandra så.
Tänk att dom händer som har smekt mej
kan riva upp så djupa sår.
Tänk att dom läppar som har kysst mej
kan attrackera mej så hårt.
Hur kan jag själv bli så förbittrad,
hur kan man säja allt jag sagt?
Hur kan jag själv bli så förhärdad,
hur kan man bli så jävla kall?
Vad är det för en gräslig avgrund
som plötsligt öppnats i min själ?
Hur kan man tänka såna tankar
om nå'n man en gång ville väl?
Jag orkar inte gå igenom
med vännerna vad som var fel.
Jag orkar en gång inte se dom,
det är fullt tillräckligt som det är!
Tids nog så kommer dom att säja
att livet måste ha sin gång.
Att nya möjligheter väntar,
att det är fel att se sej om.
För min del går livet återvända
på vilket jävla vis som helst!
Men just nu måste jag bekänna:
Det är mycket ensamt här ikväll.

Wild geese over the water, heading north and home again
Bringin' a warm wind from the south, bringin' the first taste of the spring
His mother took him to her breast and softly she did sing:
Oh, Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
His mother died that summer and he never learned to cry
He never knew his father and he never did ask why
He never knew the answers that would make an easy way
But he learned to know the wilderness and to be a man that way
His mother's brother took him in to his family and his home
Gave him a hand that he could lean on and a strength to call his own
And he learned to be a farmer and he learned to love the land
And he learned to read the seasons and he learned to make a stand
Oh, Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
On the eve of his 21st birthday, he set out on his own
He was 30 years and runnin' when he found his way back home
Ridin' a storm across the mountains and an achin' in his heart
Said he came to turn the pages and to make a brand new start
Now he never told the story of the time that he was gone
Some say he was a lawyer, some say he was a john
There was something in the city that he said he couldn't breathe
There was something in the country that he said he couldn't leave
Oh, Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
Now some say he was crazy and some are glad he's gone
But some of us will miss him and we'll try to carry on
Giving a voice to the forest, giving a voice to the dawn
Giving a voice to the wilderness and the land that he lived on
Oh, Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
Oh, Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes

 The cars in slow formation
 Not far away
 A final destination
 One mother's son
His father's distant gaze, regretting
 Where they went wrong
He always found it too upsetting
 Me and my friend
 We lived our lives completely
 From start to end
 You and your friend, so sweetly
 With strength and pride
In spite of everything, and swimming
 Against the tide
To obstinately hope of winning
 And at the end
 Your funny uncle staring
 At all your friends
 With military bearing
 And stopped to stand
To smile and speak of you directly
 Goodbye, shake hands
Like you did everything correctly
 To wipe away the tears
 No more pain, no fear
No sorrow or dying
  No waiting or crying
 These former things have passed away
Another life begins today

Nowhere in the suburbs, in the cold light of day,

 On a blue blue day 
 Blue eyes 
 Baby's got blue eyes 
 When the morning comes 
 I'll be far     away,           and I say 
 Blue eyes holding back the tears 
 holding back the pain 
 Baby's got blue eyes 
 And she's alone      again 
 Blue eyes  
 Baby's got blue eyes 
 Like a clear blue sky 
 Watching over me 
 Blue eyes 
 Ooo, I love blue eyes 
 When I'm by her side 
 Where I long to be             I will see 
 Blue eyes laughing in the sun 
 Laughing in the rain 
 Baby's got blue eyes 
 And I am home,    and I am home again 
 Blue eyes laughing in the sun 
 Laughing in the rain 
 Baby's got blue eyes 
 And I am home        again

But life goes on
And this old world just keeps on turning
Let's just be glad, we had this time
To spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges
That were burning.
Lay your head on my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body next to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Beating soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times.
I get along you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find
You ever need me.
Don't say a word
About tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough
For sadness when you leave.
Lay your head on my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body next to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops
Beating soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times.

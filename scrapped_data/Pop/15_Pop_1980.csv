0,Be Still My Beating Heart,Sting,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/sting/be-still-my-beating-heart-chords-1808817,"Be still my beating heart
It would be better to be cool
It's not time to be open just yet
A lesson once learned is so hard to forget
Be still my beating heart
I'll be taken for a fool
It's not healthy to run at this pace
The blood runs so red to my face
I've been to every single book I know
To soothe the thoughts that plague me sooooo...
I sink like a stone that's been thrown in the ocean
My logic has drowned in a sea of emotion
Stop before you start
Be still my beating heart
Be still my beating heart...
Be still my beating heart...
Be still my beating heart...
Be still my beating heart...
Restore my broken dreams
Shattered like a falling glass
I'm not ready to be broken just yet
A lesson once learned is so hard to forget
Be still my beating heart
You must learn to stand your ground
It's not healthy to run at this pace
The blood runs so red to my face
I've been to every single book I know
To soothe the thoughts that plague me sooooo...
Stop before you start
Be still my beating heart
Be still my beating heart...
Be still my beating heart...
Be still my beating heart...
Be still my beating heart...
  Never to be wrong
  Never to make promises that break
  It's like singing in the wind
  Or writing on the surface of a lake
And I wriggle like a fish caught on dry land
And I struggle to avoid any help at hand
I sink like a stone that's been thrown in the ocean
My logic has drowned in a sea of emotion
Stop before you start
Be still my beating heart
Be still my beating heart... (repeat to fade)

So they came in to the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him
There were no clues, theyâre behind him

Sounding heartbeats, intimidation

I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turned up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind ya know
Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind ya see
Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Ya gotta get it right while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart is when you close your mind
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good
Just lift yourself
You've got to start with yourself
I gotta make that change today
You've got to start with yourself...
Make that change!

3,Nothing But Flowers,Talking Heads,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/talking-heads/nothing-but-flowers-chords-1057,"Here we stand like an Adam and an Eve
Waterfalls, the Garden of Eden
Two fools in love so beautiful and strong
The birds in the trees are smiling upon them
From the age of the dinosaurs cars have run on gasoline
Where, where have they gone? Now, it's nothing but flowers
There was a factory, now there are mountains and rivers
You got it, you got it
We caught a rattlesnake, now we've got something for dinner
You got it, you got it
There was a shopping mall, now it's all covered with flowers
You got it, you got it
If this is paradise, I wish I had a lawnmower
You got it, you got it
Years ago I was an angry young man
I'd pretend that I was a billboard
Standing tall by the side of the road
I fell in love with a beautiful highway
This used to be real estate, now it's only fields and trees
Where, where is the town? Now, it's nothing but flowers
The highways and cars were sacrificed for agriculture
I thought that we'd start all over, but I guess I was wrong
Once there were parking lots, now it's a peaceful oasis
You got it, you got it
This was a Pizza Hut, now it's all covered with daisies
You got it, you got it
I miss the Honky Tonks, Dairy Queens and 7-Elevens
You got it, you got it
And as things fell apart, nobody payed much attention
You got it, you got it
I dream of cherry pies, candy bars and chocolate chip cookies
You got it, you got it
We used to microwave, now we just eat nuts and berries
You got it, you got it
This was a discount store, now it's turned into a cornfield
You got it, you got it
Don't leave me stranded here, I can't get used to this lifestyle

 They follow each other on the wind, ya' know,
'Cos they got nowhere to go; that's why I want you to know;
 I'm starting with the man in the mirror;
 I'm asking him to change his ways.
 And no message, could have been any clearer;
Take a look at yourself and then make a change.
          Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah.
 I've been a victim of, a selfish kind of love,
 It's time that I realise;
That there are some with no home; not a nickel to loan,
 Could it be really me, pre-tending they're not alone?
 A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart,
 And a washed out dream.
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya' see,
'Cos they got no place to be; that's why I'm starting with me.
 I'm starting with the man in the mirror;
 I'm asking him to change his ways.
 And no message, could have been any clearer;
Take a look at yourself and then make a change.
 I'm starting with the man in the mirror;
 I'm asking him to change his ways.
 And no message, could have been any clearer;
 Change...
I'm starting with the man in the mirror;
 I'm asking him to change his ways.
 And no message, could have been any clearer;
'Cos when you close your heart, you can't close your mind.
I'm starting with the man in the mirror;
 I'm asking him to change his ways.
 And no message, could have been any clearer;
 Change.
 Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah.
 Na na na, na na na, na na, na nah.
 Oh no, oh no, I'm gonna make a change, it's gonna feel real good, shamon.
 Each time the wind blows, I hear your voice so, I call your name...
 Whispers at morning, our love is dawning, Heaven's glad you came...
You know how I feel; this thing can't go wrong,
 I'm so proud to say; I love you.
Your love's got me high; I long to get by,
 This time is forever; love is the answer.
 I hear your voice now, you are my choice now, the love you bring.
 Heaven's in my heart, at your call, I hear harps; and angels sing.
You know how I feel; this thing can't go wrong,
 I can't live my life without you.
I just can't hold on, I feel we belong,
 My life ain't worth living, if I can't be with you.
 I just can't stop loving you,
 I just can't stop loving you.
 And if I stop... then tell me; just what will I do?
'Cos I just can't stop loving you.
At night when the stars shine, I pray in you I'll find, a love so true...
When morning awakes me, will you come and take me; I'll wait for you.
You know how I feel, I won't stop until,
 I hear your voice saying; ""I do"", (""I do"").
This thing can't go wrong, this feeling's so strong,
 My life ain't worth living, if I can't be with you.
 I just can't stop loving you,
 I just can't stop loving you.
 And if I stop... then tell me; just what will I do?
'Cos I just can't stop loving you.
We can change all the world tomorrow,
We can sing songs of yester-day.
I can say, hey... farewell to sorrow,
This is my life, and I want to see you for always.
 I just can't stop loving you,
 I just can't stop loving you.
 And if I stop... then tell me; just what will I do?
 I just can't stop loving you,
 I just can't stop loving you.
 And if I stop... then tell me; just what will I do?
You'll never make me stay, so take your weight off of me,
I know your every move, so won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before, but I was too blind to see,
That you se-duce every man; this time you won't seduce me.
She's saying; that's ok, hey baby, do what you please,
I have the stuff that you want; I am the thing that you need.
She looked me deep in the eyes, she's touchin' me, so to start,
She says there's no turnin' back; she trapped me in her heart.
Dirty Di-ana, no,
Dirty Di-ana, no.
Dirty Di-ana, no,
Dirty Di-ana; let me be!
She likes the boys in the band; she knows when they come to town,
Every musician's fan, after the curtain comes down.
She waits at backstage doors, for those who have pres-tige,
Who promise fortune and fame; a life that's so care-free.
She's saying; that's ok, hey baby, do what you want,
I'll be your night lovin' thing, I'll be the freak you can taunt.
And I don't care what you say; I want to go too far,
I'll be your everything, if you make me a star.
Dirty Di-ana, no,
Dirty Di-ana, no.
Dirty Di-ana, no,
Dirty Di-ana.
Dirty Di-ana, no,
Dirty Di-ana, no.
Dirty Di-ana, no,
Dirty Di-ana.
Dia-na!
Dia-na!
Dirty Di-ana!
It's Di-a-aa-aa, come on!
She said I have to go home, 'cos I'm real tired you see,
But I hate sleepin' alone; why don't you come with me?
I said my baby's at home; she's probably worried to-night,
I didn't call on the phone, to say that I'm al-right.
Diana walked up to me, she said; I'm all yours to-night,
At that I ran to the phone, sayin'; baby, I'm al-right.
I said but unlock the door, because I forgot the key.
She said; he's not coming back; because he's sleeping with me.
Dirty Di-ana, no,
Dirty Di-ana, no.
Dirty Di-ana, no,
Dirty Di-ana, no.
Dirty Di-ana, no,
Dirty Di-ana, no.
Dirty Di-ana, no,
Dirty Di-ana.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
 As he came into the window; it was the sound of, a cres-cendo.
 He came into her a-partment; he left the bloodstains, on the carpet.
 She ran underneath the table; he could see she, was un-able.
 So she ran into the bedroom; she was struck down; it was her doom.
 Annie are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok, Annie?
 Annie are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok, Annie?
 Annie are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok, Annie?
 Annie are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok, Annie?
 Annie are you ok? Will you tell us, that you're ok?
 There's a sign in the window, that he struck you; a cres-cendo, Annie.
 He came into your apartment; he left the bloodstains, on the carpet.
 Then you ran into the bedroom; you were struck down; it was your doom.
 Annie are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok, Annie?

 Annie are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok, Annie?
 You've been hit by, you've been hit by; a smooth criminal.
 So they came into the outway; it was Sunday; what a black day.
 Mouth to mouth resusci-tation, sounding heartbeats; intimi-dations.
 Annie are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok, Annie?
 Annie are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok, Annie?
 Annie are you ok? So, Annie are you ok? Are you ok, Annie?

 I don't care what you talkin' 'bout, baby,
 I don't care what you say.
 Don't you come walkin', beggin' back, mama,
 I don't care, any-way.
 Time after time, I gave you all of my money;
 No ex-cuses to make.
 Ain't no mountain that I can't climb, baby,
 All is going my way.
('Cos there's a time when you're right, and you know you must fight);
Who's laughing baby?  Don't you know?
(And there's a choice that we make, and this choice, you will take);
Who's laughin' baby?
 So just leave me a-lone, girl, (leave me alone),
 Leave me alone...
Leave me a-lone, (leave me alone), (leave me alone), (leave me alone).
Leave me a-lone, stop it; just stop doggin' me a-round, (just stop doggin' me).
 There was a time, I used to say, girl, I need you,
 But who is sorry now?
 You really hurt; you used to take and de-ceive me,
 Now who is sorry now?
 You got a way of making me feel so sorry,
 I found out right a-way.
 Don't you come walkin', beggin; I ain't lovin' you;
 Don't you get in my way.
('Cos there's a time when you're right, and you know you must fight);
Who's laughing baby?  Don't you know?
(And there's a choice that we make, and this choice, you will take);
Who's laughin' baby?
 So just leave me a-lone, girl, (leave me alone),
 Leave me alone...
Leave me a-lone, (leave me alone), (leave me alone), (leave me alone).
Leave me a-lone, stop it; just stop doggin' me a-round, (just stop doggin' me).

Don't come beggin' me, don't come beggin',
 Don't come lovin' me, don't come beggin'.
 I love you, I don't want it,
 I don't, I don't... I don't... I... I... I... ow!

This is your life, this new life has begun

They can support you when you're on your way

Open your heart, show him the anger and pain, so you heal
Maybe he's looking for his womanly side, let him feel
You have to be so strong

Nothing wrong at all

Your blood like winter freezes just like ice
And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win
Well look at me I'm coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing you just fade away
Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did

Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
Once I never could hope to win
You starting down the road leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down

 Warm you in my arms, and melt your fears a-way.

 All the magic that a perfect love can make; I need you night and day.
So baby, be mine, (baby, you gotta be mine),
And girl, I'll give you all I got to give.
So baby, be my girl, (all the time),
And we can share this ecstasy, as long as we believe, in love.

Since I met her from the start.
I'm so proud I am the only one, who is special in her heart.
The girl is mine; ...the doggone girl is mine.
 I know she's mine; ...because the doggone girl is mine.
I don't understand the way you think, saying that she's yours, not mine,
Sending roses and your silly dreams; really just a waste of time.
Because she's mine; ...the doggone girl is mine.
 Don't waste your time, ...because the doggone girl is mine.
I love you more than he, (take you anywhere),
But I love you endlessly, (loving we will share).
So come and go with me, to one town.
But we, both cannot have her, so it's, one or the other.
And one, day you'll dis-cover; that she's my girl for-ever and ever.
Don't build your hopes, to be let down, 'cos I really feel it's time.
I know she'll tell you; I'm the one for her, 'cos she said I blow her mind.
The girl is mine; ...the doggone girl is mine.
 Don't waste your time, ...because the doggone girl is mine.

It's close to midnight, and something evil's, lurking in the dark.
Under the moonlight, you see a sight, that almost stops your heart.
You try to scream, but terror takes the sound, before you make it.
You start to freeze, as horror looks you right between the eyes;
You're para-lyzed.
'Cos this is; Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike.
You know it's; Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
You're fighting for your life, inside a killer, Thriller, to-night.
You hear the door slam, and realise there's nowhere left to run.
You feel the cold hand, and wonder if you'll ever see the sun.
You close your eyes, and hope that this is just imagi-nation.
But all the while, you hear the creature creepin' up be-hind;
You're out of time.
'Cos this is; Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
There ain't no second chance to kill the thing with forty eyes, girl.
 Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
You're fighting for your life, inside a killer, Thriller, to-night.
 Night creatures call and the dead start to walk in their masquerade.
 There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien, this time;
 This is the end of your life.
 They're out to get you; there's demons closing in on every side.
They will pos-sess you; unless you change the number on your dial.
Now is the time, for you and I to cuddle close to-gether.
All through the night, I'll save you from the terror on the screen;
I'll make you see...
That this is; Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
'Cos I can thrill you more than any ghost would dare try.
 Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
So let me hold you tight, and share a killer,
 Diller, chiller, Thriller here to-night.
That this is; Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
'Cos I can thrill you more than any ghost would dare try.
 Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
So let me hold you tight, and share a killer, thriller, ow!
 ...I'm gonna thrill you tonight.
 Darkness falls across the land, the midnight hour is close at hand.
 Creatures crawl in search of blood, to terrorise your neighbourhood.
 And whosoever shall be found, without the soul for getting down,
Must stand and face the Hounds of Hell and rot inside a corpse's shell.
The foulest stench is in the air; the funk of forty thousand years,
And grizzy ghouls from every tomb, are closing in to seal your doom.
 And though you fight to stay alive; your body starts to shiver,
For no mere mortal can resist, the evil of The Thriller...
 They told him; don't you ever come around here;
Don't wanna see your face; you better disappear.
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear,
So beat it, just beat it.
 You better run, you better do what you can;
Don't wanna see no blood; don't be a macho man.
You wanna be tough; better do what you can,
So beat it; but you wanna be bad.
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it;
 No one wants to be de-feated.
 Showin' how funky and strong, is your fight,
 It doesn't matter, who's wrong or right;
Just beat it, beat it, just beat, beat it.
Just beat it, beat it, just beat, beat it.
 They're out to get you; better leave while you can;
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man.
You wanna stay alive; better do what you can,
So beat it, just beat it.
 You have to show them that you're really not scared;
You're playin' with your life; this ain't no truth or dare.
They'll kick you, then they beat you, then they'll tell you its fair;
So beat it; but you wanna be bad.
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it;
 No one wants to be de-feated.

 She was more like a beauty queen, from a movie scene,
 I said; don't mind, but what do you mean; I am the one?
Who will dance on the floor, in the round.
She said; I am the one, who will dance on the floor, in the round.
 She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene.
 Then every head turned, with eyes that dreamed of being the one,
Who will dance on the floor, in the round.
 People always told me; be careful what you do;
And don't go around breaking young girl's hearts.
And mother always told me; be careful of who you love;
And be careful of what you do, 'cos the lie becomes the truth.
 Billie Jean is not my lover;
 She's just a girl who, claims that I am the one.
But the kid is not my son.
She says; I am the one, but the kid is not my son.
 For forty days and forty nights, the law was on her side.
 But who can stand, when she's in demand, her schemes and plans?
'Cos we danced on the floor, in the round.
So take my strong a-dvice; just remember to always think twice.
(Do think twice, do think twice).
 She told my baby we'd danced 'till three, then she looked a me,
 Then showed a photo; my baby cried; his eyes looked like mine.
Go on dance on the floor, in the round, baby.
 People always told me; be careful what you do;
And don't go around breaking young girl's hearts.
She came and stood right by me; then the smell of sweet perfume.
This happened much too soon; she called me to her room.

 She's just a girl who, claims that I am the one.
But the kid is not my son.

 Looking out, across the night-time;
 The city winks a sleepless eye.
 Hear her voice, shake my window;
 Sweet se-ducing sighs.
 Get me out, into the night-time;
 Four walls won't hold me, to-night.
 If this town, is just an apple;
 Then let me take a bite. (If they say);
 Why? why? Tell them that its human nature.
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? (If they say);
 Why? why? Tell them that its human nature.
 Why? why? Does he do me that way?
 Reaching out, to touch a stranger;
 Electric eyes are every-where.
 See that girl; she knows I'm watching,
 She likes the way I stare. (If they say):
 Why? why? Tell them that its human nature.
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? (If they say);

 Looking out, a-cross the morning,
 The city's heart begin to beat.
 Reaching out, I touch her shoulder;
 I'm dreaming of the street. (If they say):
 Why? why? Tell them that its human nature.
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? (If they say);

 Why? why? Ta da da da, ta da ta da.
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? I like livin' this way.
 Where did you come from, lady, and ooh, won't you take me there?
 Right away, won't you, baby?
 Tendoroni, you've got to be; spark my nature; sugar, fly with me.
Don't you know; now is the perfect time?
 We can make it right; hit the city lights.
Then to-night, ease the lovin' pain;
 Let me take you to the max.
I want to love you, (P.Y.T.), Pretty Young Thing,
 You need some lovin', (T.L.C.), Tender lovin' care.
 And I'll... take you there.

 Anywhere you wanna go.
 Nothin' can stop this burnin',
De-sire to be with you; gotta get to you baby.
 Won't you come? It's emergency;
Cool my fire yearnin', honey; come set me free.
Don't you know; now is the perfect time?
 We can dim the lights, just to make it right.
In the night; hit the lovin' spot;
 I'll give you all I've got.
I want to love you, (P.Y.T.), Pretty Young Thing,
 You need some lovin', (T.L.C.), Tender lovin' care.
 And I'll... take you there.

 And I'll... take you there, take you there.
 There'll be no darkness to-night;
 Lady our love, will shine,
 (Lighting the light).
 Just put your trust in my heart,
And meet me in para-dise.
 (Now is the time). Girl...
 You're every wonder in this world to me;
 A treasure time won't steal a-way.
 So listen to my heart; lay your body close to mine,
Let me fill you with my dreams; I can make you feel all right.
 And baby, through the years; gonna love you, more each day,
So I promise you, to-night; that you'll always be the lady in my life.
 Lay back in my tenderness;
 Let's make this a night, we won't for-get.
Girl, I need your sweet caress.
 Reach out to a fantasy;
 Two hearts, in the beat of ecsta-sy; come to me, girl...
 And I will keep you warm, through the shadows of the night,
Let me touch you with my love; I can make you feel so right.
 And baby, through the years; even when we're old and grey;
I will love you, more each day, 'cos you will always be the lady in my life.

But to you I gave my affection right from the start
I have a lover who loves me, how could I break such a heart
Yet still you gained my attention
Why do you come here when you know I've got trouble enough
Why do you call me when you know I can't answer the phone
You make me lie and I don't want to
You make someone else some kind of unknowing fool
You make me stay when I should not
Are you so strong or is all the weakness in me
Why do you come here and pretend to be just passing by
But I need to see you
And I need to hold you,    tightly
Feeling guilty, worried, waking from tormented sleep
This old love has bound but the new love cuts deep
if I choose now, I'll lose out, one of you has to fall
But I need you, and you.

Why do you call me when you know I can't answer the phone

 Pour ces filles qui n'ont pas d'manières,
 Les hospitalières, les dociles,
 Vous les appelez les filles faciles,
 Celles qui marchandent pas leur corps,
 Ni pour des mots ni pour de l'or,
 Pour qui faut pas tout un débat,
 Ni pour leur haut ni pour leur bas,
 Pour quelques notes de guitare,
 Elles dormiront un peu plus tard,
 Elles disent que les matins, c'est bien,
 Elles disent qu'à deux, c'est encore mieux,
 Les inespérées des timides,
 Celles qui comprennent sans qu'on leur dise,
 Pour qui ne suffit qu'un regard,
 Pour que tout s'allume en un soir.
 Petite chanson d'reconnaissance,
 Pour ces stars d'mon adolescence,
 Je n'en ai oublié aucune,
 Chère et précieuse, une à une.
 Celles qui m'ont trouvé consommable,
 Avant qu'sois dans les hit-parades,
 Dans les bals ou les MJC,
 Comme au plus haut des Colisées,
 Celles qui n'échangent pas leur plaisir
 Pour ce qu'on pense ou c'qu'on va dire,
 Qui disent OK pour les enfers
 Contre un peu d'paradis sur terre,
 Des p'tits moments piqués en fraude
 Comme un automne au pays chaud
 Plein du goût des baisers volés
 Toujours un p'tit peu plus sucré,
 Sans qu'on en parle ou qu'on y pense,
 Sans après promis ni juré,
 Ca n'a pas la moindre importance,
 Quand c'est l'amour qu'on aime aimer.
 Ce soir je veux leur rendre hommage,
 Ca sera la seconde fois,
 Qu'elles sachent qu'ils m'est dommage
 De ne le faire que par la voix.

terwijl ze slapend met mijn kussen speelt
Ik laat ze, 
zolang ze maar met mij m'n lakens deelt

En zelfs de flikken hebben pret 
als ze sensueel voorbij marcheert
ongegeneerd

dat zij waarschijnlijk niet lang bij me blijft
Ik weet wel, 
dat zij met anderen haar tijd verdrijft
Zij heeft soms,
geheimen waar ik liever niets van weet
Zij zweeft soms, 
en droomt zodat ze soms ook mij vergeet
En zelfs de hoeders van de kerk 
kijken minzaam op haar schoonheid neer
De bisschop zegt dit is Gods werk, 
buigt z'n grijze hoofd en dankt de Heer
Nog eens een keer, 
dank u meneer
Zij heeft soms, 
geheimen waar ik liever niets van weet
Zij zweeft soms,

Working on the weekend, baby.
She's working all through the night.
A jump into the deep end gave her
The evidence she required.
Takes five; she's got pearls.
Don't fake it when it comes to making money.
So she smiles. But that's cruel.
If you know what she thinks
If you knew what she was after.
Sometimes she wonders,
And she laughs in her frustration.
Would someone please explain
The reason for this strange behaviour.
In exploitation's name
We must be working for the Skin Trade.

La tua Barbie e' da un po'
che non l'hai
e il tuo passo e' da
donna ormai
al telefono e' sempre segreto
quante cose in un filo di fiato
e vorrei domandarti chi e'
ma lo so che hai vergogna di me
la porta chiusa male e tu

quelle sere non dormiro' mai

qualche volta hai gia'
pianto per lui

malizia in certi gesti tuoi

They're tearing it down now
But it's just as well
I haven't shown you everything a man can do
So stay with me baby
I've got plans for you
This is the time to remember
Cause it will not last forever
These are the days to hold on to
Cause we won't although we'll want to
This is the time
But time is gonna change
You've given me the best of you
And now I need the rest of you
So we embrace again beyond the dunes
This beach is so cold on winter afternoons
ah but holding you close is like holding the summer sun
a long from the memory from the days to come
Sometimes it's so easy to let a day slip on by
without even seeing each other at all
but this the time you turn back to so so blind ..
those will be days you can never recall.
This is the time to remember
Cause it will not last forever
These are the days to hold on to
Cause we won't although we'll want to
This is the time
But time is gonna change
You've given me the best of you
And now I need the rest of you
Did you know that before you came into my life
It was some kind of miracle that I survived
Some day we will both look back and have to laugh
We lived through a lifetime and the aftermath
This is the time to remember
Cause it will not last forever
These are the days to hold on to
Cause we won't although we'll want to
This is the time
But time is gonna change

The Orioles, and The Five Satins
The easy stream of laughter
    Flowing through the air

Decades gliding by like Indians
Time is cheap

And they looked in their bedroom drawer

You can feel it starting all over again.
The moon comes up and the music calls,
You're gettin' tired of staring at the same four walls.
You're out of your room and down on the street,
Looking through the crowd in the midnight heat.
The traffic roars and the sirens scream,
You look at the faces - it's just like a dream.
Nobody knows where you're going,
Nobody cares where you've been,
Cause you belong to the city , You belong to the night,
Living in a river of darkness beneath the neon light.
You were born in the city , concrete under your feet
It's in your moves , it's in your blood:
You're a man of the streets.
When you said goodbye you were on the run
Tryin' to get away from the things you've done.
Now you're back again and you're feeling strange
So much has happened and nothing has changed.
Still don't know where you're going ,
You're still just a face in the crowd,
You belong to the city, you belong to the night
Living in a river of darkness beneath the neon light.
You were born in the city , concrete under your feet
It's in your blood , it's in your moves:
You're a man of the streets.

The cold remains of what began with a passionate start
But it will, it's just a question of when
I've lived long enough to have learned
The closer you get to the fire the more you get burned
Because it's always been a matter of trust 
I know you're an emotional girl
It took a lot for you to not lose your faith in this world
But you're gonna face a moment of truth
It's hard when you're always afraid
You just recover when another belief is betrayed
It's a matter of trust 
You can't go the distance
With too much resistance
I know you have doubts
But for God's sake don't shut me out 
This time you've got nothing to lose
You can take it, you can leave it, whatever you choose
And I'll walk away a fool or a king
Some love is just a lie of the mind
It's make believe until it's only a matter of time
But then it never was a matter of trust 
I'm sure you're aware love
We've both had our share of 
Believing too long
When the whole situation was wrong 
Some love is just a lie of the soul
A constant battle for the ultimate state of control
There can hardly be a question of why
Some love is just a lie of the heart
The cold remains of what began with a passionate start

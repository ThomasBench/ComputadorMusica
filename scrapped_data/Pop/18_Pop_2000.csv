0,Vanilla Twilight (ver 8),Owl City,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/owl-city/vanilla-twilight-chords-1211873," The stars lean down to kiss you and I lie awake and miss you,
 Pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere.
 ‘Cause I'll doze off safe and soundly but I'll miss your arms around me
 I'd send a postcard to you dear ‘cause I wish you were here. 
 I watch the night turn light blue but it's not the same without you, 
 Because it takes two to whisper quietly, 
 The silence isn't so bad til I look at my hands and feel sad, 
 ‘Cause the spaces between my fingers are right where yours fit perfectly.
 I'll find repose in new ways though I haven't slept in two days, 
 ‘Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone.
 But drenched in Vanilla twilight, I'll sit on the front porch all night, 
 Waist deep in thought because when I think of you,
I don't feel so alone.
I don't feel so alone.
I don't feel so alone.
As many times as I blink I'll think of you, tonight.
                              I'll think of you tonight
 When violet eyes get brighter and heavy wings grow lighter,
 I'll taste the sky and feel alive again.
 And I'll forget the world that I knew but I swear I won't forget you,
 Oh if my voice could reach back through the past, 
 I'd whisper in your ear, “oh darling I wish you were here”

I knew that you had
A flame in your heart
And under wild blue skies      
Marble move skies
I found a home in your eyes    
We would never be apart
And when the fires came
The smell of cinders and rain
Perfumed almost everything
We laughed and laughed and laughed
And in the golden blue
Crying took me to 
the darkest place you knew
And set fire to my heart
When I run in the dark
Da--niel
To a place that's worst
Da--niel
Under a sheet of rain in the heart

Don't get me wrong

where all my thoughts go hiding
And right under your clothes is where I'll find them
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey
'Cause of you I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you 
I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone
When the party is over
We will still belong to each other
I love you more than all that's on the planet
moving, talking, walking, breathing
You know it's true, oh babe it's so funny
You almost don't believe it

Lamps are hanging from the ceiling

I'm tied up to this feeling

Please wear the face
The one where you smile
Lighten up my heart
When I start to cry
Forgive me first love
But I'm tired
I need to get away
To feel again
Try to understand why
Don't get so close
Please wipe that look
To doubt myself
Simply, it's tiring
This love has dried up
And stayed behind
And if I stay
It’d be a lie
Then choke on words
I'd always hide
Excuse me first love
But we're through
I need to taste the kiss
From someone new
Forgive me first love

I'm bored to say
I lack desire

You know I'd fight for you but
How could I fight someone who isn't even there
I've had the rest of you now
I want the best of you, I don't care if that's not fair
Cause I want it all
Or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom it's now or never

Or are we just friends
Is this how it ends
With a simple telephone call?
You leave me here with nothing at all
There are time it seems to me
I'm sharing you with memories
I feel it in my heart but I don't show it, show it
Then there's times you look at me
As though I'm all that you could see
Those times I don't believe it's right I know it, know it
Don't make me promises baby
You never did know how to keep them well

I undress my mind and dare you to follow
Paint a portrait of my mystery
Only close my eyes and you are here with me
A nameless face to think I see
To sit and watch the waves with me till they’re gone
A heart I’d swear I’d recognize is
Made out of my own devices….could I be wrong?
Time that I’ve taken
Pray is not wasted
Have I already tasted my piece of
One sweet love?
Sleepless nights you creep inside of me
Weave your shadows in the breath that we share
You take more than just my sanity
Take my reason not to care.
No ordinary wings I’ll need
The sky itself will carry me back to you
Things I dream that I can do
I’ll open up the moon for you…Just come down soon
Time that I’ve taken
Pray is not wasted
Have I already tasted my piece of
One sweet love?
Ready and waiting
For a heart worth the breaking
But I’d settle for an honest mistake in the name of
One sweet love.
Savor the sorrow to soften the pain
Sip on the southern rain, as I do
I don’t look don’t touch don’t do anything
But hope that there is a you.
The earth that is the space between
I’d banish it from under me…to get to you.
An unexpected love provides
My solitary suicide…oh I wish I knew
Time that I’ve taken
Pray is not wasted
Have I already tasted my piece of
One sweet love?
Ready and waiting
For a heart worth the breaking
But I’d settle for an honest mistake in the name of
One sweet love.

But asking for your telephone number seems highly inappropriate,
Seeing as I can't even say ""hi"" when you walk by
And that time you shook my hand, it felt so nice
I swear I've never felt this way about any other guy
and I don’t usually notice people's eyes, but...
I conducted a plan to bump into you most accidentally, 
but I was walking along and I bumped into you much more heavily 
than I'd originally planned and it was well embarrassing
and I think you’ve thought, that I was a bit of a twat
Oh, I just think that we'd get on,
I wish I could tell you face to face
instead of singing this stupid song,
but yeah I just think, that we might get on 
So I went to that party everyone they were kind of arty
And I was wearing this dress, 'cause I wanted to impress
I wasn't sure if I look my best, 'cause I was so nervous
But I carried on regardless strutting through each room 
trying to find you
And when I saw you kissing that girl my heart, it shattered
and my eyes, they watered and when I tried to speak I stuttered
And my friends were like ""Whatever, you'll find someone better,
his eyes are way too close together 
and we never even liked him from the start
And now he's with that tart and I heard she'd done some really nasty stuff
down in the park with Michael, he said she's easy 
and if your guys are with someone who's that's sleazy
then he ain't worth your time, ‘cause you deserve a real nice guy""
So I proceeded to get drunk and to cry
and I locked myself in the toilets the entire night
Saturday night, I watch Channel 5
I particularly like CSI
I don't ever dream about you and me,
I don't ever make up stuff about us that would be considered insanity,
I don't ever drive by your house to see if you're in,
I don't even have an opinion on that tramp that you are still seeing,
I don't know your timetable, I don't know your face off by heart,
But I must admit that there is a part of me that still thinks,
we might get on, that we could get on, that we should get on...

You get pretty damn close

From all of this danger you don't know how

When I'm in the red 
Listening to strangers inside my head 
The darkening angels beneath the bed

For treating you like a queen

Your boyfriends might be angry
My girlfriends might be blue

I have to say it's new to me

Guess I've been kind of lonely

molto probabilmente penseresti a una partenza.
Si vivesse solo d'inizi
di eccitazioni da prima volta
quando tutto ti sorprende e nulla ti appartiene ancora
Penseresti all'odore di un libro nuovo,
a quello di vernice fresca
a un regalo da scartare, al giorno prima della festa.
Al 21 marzo, al primo abbraccio, a una matita intera, alla primavera
alla paura del debutto al tremore dell'esordio
ma tra la partenza e il traguardo
In mezzo c'è tutto il resto e tutto il resto è giorno dopo giorno
e giorno dopo giorno è silenziosamente costruire
e costruire è sapere e potere rinunciare alla perfezione.
Ma il finale, è di certo più teatrale, così di ogni storia, ricordi solo la sua conclusione
così come l'ultimo bicchiere, l'ultima visione,
un tramonto solitario, l'inchino poi il sipario
ma tra l'attesa e il suo compimento
tra il primo tema e il testamento
In mezzo c'è tutto il resto e tutto il resto è giorno dopo giorno
e giorno dopo giorno è silenziosamente costruire
e costruire è sapere e potere rinunciare alla perfezione.

Or does anybody even know she's going down today?
Under the shadow of our steeple
With all the lost and lonely people
Searching for the hope that's tucked away in you and me

That she never found at home

To ride in and save the day
And in walks her prince charming

Momentary lapse of reason
And she gives herself away

If lofty glances from lofty people
Can't see past her scarlet letter

Nobody can see them, nobody but me, and you're the reason
The only thing that keeps me from diving off the deep end
Because I've got all these demons, demons, demons, mhm
Well, at first I thought I had to bear this weight by myself
But when my knees were getting weak and I was in need of help
You were there to take away the pain that I felt, mhm
You are the only one that gave me hope
You're the only one who really knows
I've got all these demons hiding underneath
Nobody can see them, nobody but me, and you're the reason
The only thing that keeps me from diving off the deep end
Because I've got all these demons, demons, demons, mhm
For a moment I thought maybe I was doing alright
So I took your love for granted and I left you behind
And I just didn't understand, you kept me alive, mhm
You forgave me and you gave me hope
Still you're the only one who really knows
I've got all these demons hiding underneath
Nobody can see them, nobody but me, and you're the reason
The only thing that keeps me from diving off the deep end
Because I've got all these demons, demons, demons, mhm
It's you, you pull me through it on the days when I have doubts
Even when I turned my back on you, you never let me down
And even when I hit the bottom, no, you didn't let me drown
No, oh
I've got all these demons hiding underneath
Nobody can see them, nobody but me, and you're the reason
The only thing that keeps me from diving off the deep end
Because I've got all these demons, demons, demons, mhm

1,I Hate Everybody (ver 2),Halsey,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/halsey/i-hate-everybody-chords-2962412,"  I'm my own biggest enemy
Yeah, all my empathy's a disaster
Wrapped too tightly 'round my own master
  My friends are getting bored of me
Saying I fell in love with a stranger
But in reality I don't even
  Remember anything but thinking you're the one
And I can force a future like it's nothing, so I
Just hate everybody
Well then why can't I go home without somebody?
And really I could fall in love with anybody
Who don't want me, so I just keep saying
I hate everybody
But maybe I, maybe I don't
  I know I've got a tendency
To exaggerate what I'm seeing
To make a memory
Out of a feeling
  It's 'cause I notice every single thing
That's ever happening in the moment
Because honestly all I know is
  Infatuations, observation with a cause
I'll hate everybody
Well then why can't I go home without somebody?
And really I could fall in love with anybody
Who don't want me, so I just keep saying
I hate everybody
But maybe I, maybe I don't
If I could make you love me
Maybe you could make me love me
And if I can't make you love me
Then I'll just hate everybody

And really I could fall in love with anybody

You think I'm lying but I'm, I'm  being  dead serious
Okay, I'll prove it
Well, who am I? I'm  almost 25
Can't remember half the time that I've been alive
'Cause half was in a cheap apartment
And half was on the Eastside (Eastside)
They said don't meet your heroes, they're all fuckin' weirdos
And God knows that they were right
Because nobody loves you, they just try to fuck you
Then put you on a feature on the B-Side
And who do you call when it's late at night?
When the headlines just don't paint the picture right
When you look at yourself on a screen and say
""Oh my God, there's no way that's me""
And I, I quit smoking, well recently, I tried
And I bought another house, and I never go outside
And I remember this girl with pink hair in Detroit
Well, she told me
She said, ""Ashley, you gotta promise us that you won't die
'Cause we need you,"" and honestly, I think that she lied
And I remember the names of every single kid I've met
But I forget half the people who I've gotten in bed
And I've stared at the sky in Milwaukee
And hoped that my father would finally call me
And it's just these things that I'm thinkin' for hours
And I'm pickin' my hair out in clumps in the shower
Lost the love of my life to an ivory powder
But then I realize that I'm no higher power
That I wasn't in love then, and I'm still not now
And I'm so happy I figured that out
I've got a long way to go until self-preservation
Think my moral compass is on a vacation
And I can't believe I still feed my fucking temptation
I'm still looking for my salvation
Soft and slow, watch the minutes go
Count out loud, so we know you don't keep 'em for yourself
Watch the minutes go
Count out loud, so we know you don't keep 'em for yourself
I think I have a confession to make, I feel like (So we know you don't)
I need to say that I was really born at 9:26
I saw my birth certificate, and I'm a liar
And I'm a fucking liar

And your clothes that I used to love wearing

Wish I understood what the priest was sayin'
Drank the blood of Christ, took the bread and ate it

Words of God so I never feel unloved

Phase out and smile over
That little phrase, it isn't you, baby, it's me
So take the tarot card and tell a fortune gold
The past heartbreaks, the lies we told, we tell again
Let's be friends then never speak again
It's cool, we can just pretend
We're friends and never speak again
See you soon, hope we can remain good friends
You take it, the bottle down
Man, this is easier than how I thought it'd go
You're smiling like a devil
You tell me you were coming here to let me know that
It's over when it's over

And even though you're far away, can you see my red light?
'Cause I feel so isolated without you
I can't play a happy tune on my own, so stay by my side

 Yritän opetella kytkintä käyttää
 Lapset arvuuttelee, mihinkä me mennään?
 Rankkasateessa eteeni mä en nää
Mitään
Tässäkö tää oli?
 Levii nelostielle lasten Monopoli
Jäi juomatta se kylmä alkoholi-

Vaikeneee radiossa nuorisoidoli
Ja nyt meitä ympäröi tää totaalinen hiljaisuus

 Oon heille tuottanu liikaa pettymyksii
Meidän koulut ja duunit meni pieleen
 Kinkuton joulu on jäänyt mulle mieleen
 Soliferi nousi tiellä vesiliirtoon
 Alle sekunti miettii omaa siirtoo
Renkaat linkussa, vauhtia se satanen
 En tiiä oisko selvinnyt ees Vatanen

 Ja vaikka kuukauden mä olen vuoteenoma
Ei se haittaa vaikka on kipsattuna ranne

Iskä teki meistä julkkiksii

0,I Dont Wanna Live Forever,Taylor Swift,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/taylor-swift/i-dont-wanna-live-forever-chords-1908714,"  Been sitting, eyes wide open behind these four walls hoping you'll call
  It's just a cruel existence like it's no point hoping at all
  Baby, baby, I feel crazy, up all night, all night and every day
  Give me something, oh, but you say nothing, What is happening to me?
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
     I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
     I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
   I'm sitting, eyes wide open and I got one thing stuck in my mind
   Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life
  Baby, baby, I feel crazy, up all night, all night and every day
  I gave you something, but you gave me nothing, What is happening to me?
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
     I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
     I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
   Baby, baby, I feel crazy
I see you around in all these empty faces
Up All night, all night and every day
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
  Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
Now I'm in a cab, I tell him where your place is
What is happening to me?
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
     I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
     I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
     I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
     I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
     I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
    Until you come back home

1,Subeme La Radio,Enrique Iglesias,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/enrique-iglesias/subeme-la-radio-chords-1953467,"Súbeme la radio 
Tra-tráeme el alcohol 
Súbeme la radio que esta es mi canción
Siente el bajo que va subiendo
Tráeme el alcohol que quita el dolor
Hoy vamos a juntar la luna y el sol
Súbeme la radio que esta es mi canción
Siente el bajo que va subiendo
Tráeme el alcohol que quita el dolor
Hoy vamos a juntar la luna y el sol
Ya no me importa nada
Ni el día ni la hora
Si lo he perdido todo
Me has dejado en las sombras
Te juro que te pienso
Hago el mejor intento
El tiempo pasa lento
Y yo me voy muriendo, (Y yo me voy muriendo)
Si llega la noche y tú no contestas
Te juro me quedo esperando en tu puerta
Vivo pasando las noches en vela
Y sigo cantando bajo la luna llena
Súbeme la radio que esta es mi canción
Siente el bajo que va subiendo
Tráeme el alcohol que quita el dolor
Hoy vamos a juntar la luna y el sol
Súbeme la radio que esta es mi canción
Siente el bajo que va subiendo
Tráeme el alcohol que quita el dolor
Hoy vamos a juntar la luna y el sol
Huyendo del pasado
En cada madrugada
No encuentro ningún modo
De borrar nuestra historia
A su salud bebiendo, (A su salud bebiendo)
Mientras me quede aliento, (Mientras me quede aliento)
Solo le estoy pidiendo, (Solo te estoy pidiendo)
Romper este silencio, (Romper este silencio)
Súbeme la radio que esta es mi canción
Siente el bajo que va subiendo
Tráeme el alcohol que quita el dolor
Hoy vamos a juntar la luna y el sol
Súbeme la radio que esta es mi canción
Siente el bajo que va subiendo
Tráeme el alcohol que quita el dolor
Hoy vamos a juntar la luna y el sol
 Ando loco y desesperado en busca de tu amor
No me dejes en esta soledad te pido, En verdad te digo, vuelve conmigo
 Si tú me llamas, te juro que bailamos
 Y yo quiero verte ya, Ya no aguanto más
 Quiero darte calor, Solo una vez más
 Ya no aguanto más, Quiero verte ya, oh
Yo no te miento
Todavía te espero
Sabes bien que te quiero
No sé vivir sin ti
Yo no te miento
Todavía te espero
Sabes bien que te quiero
No se vivir sin ti

2,Red Album (ver 2),Taylor Swift,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/taylor-swift/red-chords-1191122," I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
And all we know, is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
Or fades in time
And I never (never), saw you coming
And I'll never, be the same
 You come around and the armor falls
Now all we know... is don't let go
We are alone just you and me
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
So you were never a saint 
But this love is brave and wild
And I never (never), saw you coming
And I'll never, be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something 
Good and right and real
And I never (never), saw you coming
And I'll never, be the same
I never (never), saw you coming
And I'll never, be the same
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
Lovin' him is like, drivin' a new Maserati
Down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ended so suddenly
Loving him is like, tryin' to change your mind 
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn so bright
Just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue, like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody
You never met
But loving him was red
Re ee ed, re ee ed, re ee ed
Lovin' him was red
Re ee ed, re ee ed, re ee ed
Touching him was like, realizing all you ever wanted 
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as, easy as knowin' all the words
To your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like tryin' to solve a 
Crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found love 
But love could be that srong 
Losing him was blue, like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody
You never met
But loving him was red
Re ee ed, re ee ed, oh red, re ee ed
Burnin' red, re ee ed, re ee ed
Re ee ed, 
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echos
Tellin' myself it's time now gotta let go 
But moving on from him is impossible 
When I still see it all in my, head 
And burning red
Burning was reeeeed
Oh losing him was blue, like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody
You never met
Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
Oh Burning reeeeeeeed
And that's Why he's spinnin' 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burnin' red 
Yeah, yeah
His love was like, drivin' a new Maserati
Down a dead end street.
 Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
 Out of focus eye to eye
Till the gravity's too much
 And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
 And I'd be smart to walk away 
But you're quick sand
 This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
 And all we are is skin and bone 
Trained to get along
 Forever going with the flow 
But you're friction
 This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I I I, like it
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will, get you a, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and
I will follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
 This hope is treacherous
I I I , I I I, I I I
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will, get you I'll, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and
I will follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, I'll follow you home
I'll follow you, I'll follow you home
 This slope is Treacherous
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me-e-e-e-e
I guess you didn't care, and I guess liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without meeeee
And he's long gone, when he's next to me and I 
I knew you were trouble when you walked in 
It's a shame on me now-ow
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground!
Ahh  oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Ahh  oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know, that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning-e-e-e-ing
Now I heard you moved on, the whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt, it's all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see-e-e-e-e
He was long gone, when he met me
And I realize, the joke is on me,  yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
It's a shame on me now-ow
Flew me to places I'd never been 
'Till you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in 
It's a shame on me now-ow
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground!
Ahh  oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Ahh  oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
It's a shame on me now-ow
Flew me to places I'd never been (never been)
'Till you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there)
It's a shame on me now-ow
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground!
Ahh  oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Ahh  oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
I walked to the door with you, the air was cold
But something about it felt like home somehow, and I, 
Left my scarf there at your sisters house
Oh your sweet dispositon and my wide eyed gaze 
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
The autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and, and magics not here no more
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter your cheeks were turing red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin size bed
And your mothers telling stories 'bout you on a t-ball team
You tell me about your past thinkin' your future was me
And I know it's long gone and it was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed too
Cause here we are again in the middle of the night
We dance around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well
And maybe we got lost in translation maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
Hey you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lyin' here
Cause I remember it all all all too well
Time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You cant get rid of it cause you remember it all too well yeah
Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it oh
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
It feels like a perfect night, to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh
It feels like a perfect night, for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh
Yeaaaah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines 
 I don't know about you, but I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if, you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if, we just keep dancing like we're 
Twenty-two, twenty-two
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded 
Too many cool kids, uh uh uh uh 
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene 
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping
Yeaaaah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks 
It's time, uh uh
 I don't know about you, but I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if, you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if, we just keep dancing like we're 
Twenty-two, twenty-two
I don't know about you, twenty-two, twenty-two
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news 
Oh, oh, yeah yeah
Hey! I don't know about you, but im feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if, you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if, we just keep dancing like we're 
Twenty-two,  oh oh oh, twenty-two
(Dancing like) twenty-two,  yeah, twenty-two,  yeah yeah
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news 
I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long, hard week
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me
 And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me, not to call you
  And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't
I almost dooooo
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out there's no reply
I bet it never, ever, occurred to you 
That I can't say hello to you
And risk another goodbye
 And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me, not to call you
  And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't
I almost do, 
I almost doooo
It's probably better off this way
That in my dreams you're touching my face
And asking me if I want to try again with you
  And I almost do
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me, not to call you
  And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't
I almost do, 
I almost doooo
I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long, hard week
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me
I remember when we broke up the first time 
saying this is it I've had enough cause like 
we haven't seen each other in a month 
when you said you needed space what?
Then you come around again and say
baby I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change
Trust me remember how that lasted for a day
I say I hate you we break up you call me I love you
Ooh we called it off again last night 
butooh this time I'm telling you I'm telling you
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together 
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me 
but we are never ever ever ever getting back together
like ever  
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
and me falling for it screaming that I'm right
And you hide away and find your peace of mind 
with some indie record that's much cooler than mine
Ooh you called me up again tonight 
But ooh this time I'm telling you I'm telling you
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together 
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
but we are never ever ever ever getting back together
Ooh, ooh, 
ooh, oh
I used to think that we were forever ever 
and I used to say never say never
Ugh so he calls me up and he's like 'I still love you and I'm like 'I'm just sick of it I mean 
this is exhausting you know like, we are never getting back together like ever
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together 
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me 
but we are never ever ever ever getting back together
We (ooh ooh) getting back together
We (ooh ooh) oh, getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
but we are never ever ever ever getting back together
 I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
 I threw my phone across the room, at you
 I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But yoooou       stayed
 This morning I said we should talk about it
Cause I read you should never leave a file unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said okay let's talk
And I said...
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some 
Time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm 
Mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
Before you I only dated self indulgent takers 
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
I love you because you have given me no choice but to
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some 
Time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm 
Mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both 
 Stay, stay, stay, stay
I just like hanging out with you 
All the time
Stay, and I'll be loving you for quite some...time 
No one else is gonna love me when I get
Mad, mad, mad
Cause I think that it's best if we both
 Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some 
Time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm 
Mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both 
 Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some 
Time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm 
Mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
 Found myself at your door
 Just like all those times before
 I'm not sure how I got there
 All roads they lead me here
 I imagine you are home
 In your room, all alone
 And you open your eyes into mine
 And everything feels better
 Right before your eyes
 I'm breaking and fast
 No reasons why
 Just you and me
 This is the last time I'm asking you this
 Put my name on the top of your list
 This is the last time I'm asking you why
 You break my heart in the blink of an eye
 You find yourself at my door
 Just like all those times before
 You wear your best apology
 But I was there to watch you leave
 And all the times I let you in
 Just for you to go again
 Disappear when you come back
 Everything is better
 When right before your eyes
 I'm aching run fast
 Nowhere to hide
 Just you and me
 This is the last time I'm asking you this
 Put my name on the top of your list
 This is the last time I'm asking you why
 You break my heart in the blink of an eye
 This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
 This is the last time I say it's been you all along
 This is the last time I let you in my door
 This is the last time I won't hurt you anymore
 This is the last time I'm asking you this
 Put my name on the top of your list
 This is the last time I'm asking you why
 You break my heart in the blink of an eye
 This is the last time I'm asking you this
 Put my name on the top of your list
 This is the last time I'm asking you why
 You break my heart in the blink of an eye
 This is the last time I'm asking you this
 Time I'm asking you this
 Time I'm asking you this
 This is the last time I'm asking you this
 Time I'm asking you this
 Time I'm asking you this
 This is the last time I'm asking you this
 Time I'm asking you this
 Time I'm asking you this
 This is the last time I'm asking you this
 Time I'm asking you this
 Time I'm asking you this
 I was reminiscing just the other day
 Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
 Took off fast through the green light go
 I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
 And that was the first day
 And darling it was good 
 Never looking down
 And right there where we stood 
 Was holy ground
 Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
 We blocked the noise with the sound of I need you
 Well I guess we fell apart in the usual way
 Sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
 And I see your face in every crowd
 And darling it was good 
 Never looking down
 And right there where we stood 
 Was holy ground
 Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through
 Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in this room
 But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
 It was good 
 Never looking down
 And right there where we stood 
 Was holy ground
 Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through
 But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
 Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in this room
 But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean, when they're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and lonely will wait
We had, a beautiful, magic love affair
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
In dreams, I meet you in long conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, and different cities
And time is ticking a sweet summer race in you
And you've got your demons and darling they all look like me
Cause we had, a beautiful, magic love affair
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
Distance, tire me, break down, fighting
Silence, this train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, would you just try to listen
A beautiful, magic, love affair
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic, beautiful
What we had, a beautiful, magic, love affair
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair
We had, a beautiful, magic, love affair
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair

All I knew this morning when I woke
I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago 
The back of my mind making me feel right
I just want to know you better know, you better know you, better now
I just want to know you better know, you better know, you better now
I just want to know you better know, you better know, you better now
I just want to know you, know you, know you
Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
But I'll take them down, take them down 
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies 
Taking flight, making me feel right
I just want to know you better know, you better know you, better now
I just want to know you better know, you better know, you better now
I just want to know you better know, you better know, you better now
I just want to know you, know you, know you
Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday, is everything has changed
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
Ahhh And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind
 I just want to know you better know, you better know, you better now
I just want to know you, know you, know you
Cause all I know is we said hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name, everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday, is everything has changed
All I know is we said hello
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
All I know is a new found brightness
All my days, I'll know your face
I said oh my, what a marvellous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines, 
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight
I'm a barbie on the boardwalk, summer of '45
 Picks me up, played one night at the window
He was 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
 Can't remember what song it was playing 
When we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
I said oh my, what a marvellous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines, 
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
He still look at you worrying so much about 
Things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues 
If you keep thinking away
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?
Like oh my, what a marvellous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines, 
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Ooh ooh he's talking crazy
Ooh ooh dancing with me
Ooh ooh we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream
Like oh my, what a marvellous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines, 
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Took a deep breath in the mirror
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
But I do  
Walked in expecting you'd be late
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
But I do
 And you throw your head back laughin' like a, little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny cause,
He never did
And I've been spending the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is 
Break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
He said he never met one girl who
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
But I do
 But you throw your head back laughin' like a, little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny cause,
He never did
And I've been spending the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is 
Break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
And we walk down the block to my car
But you start to talk about the movies 
That your family watches, every single Christmas
And I want to talk about that
 Cause you throw your head back laughin' like a, little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny cause,
He never did
And I've been spending the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is 
Break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again
But on a Wednesday in a cafe

Where everyone can see
They call you cry baby, cry baby
But you don't fucking care
Cry baby, cry baby
So you laugh through your tears
Cry baby, cry baby
Cause you don't fucking care
Tears fall to the ground
You just let them drown
Cry baby, cry baby
You just let them drown
Cry baby, cry baby
You just let them drown
I look at you and I see myself
I know you better than anyone else
I have the same faucet in my eyes
So your tears
Are mine
They call me cry baby, cry baby
But I don't fucking care
Cry baby, cry baby
So I laugh through my tears
Cry baby, cry baby
Cause I don't fucking care
Tears fall to the ground
I just let them drown
They call me cry baby, cry baby
But I don't fucking care
Cry baby, cry baby
So I laugh through my tears
Cry baby, cry baby
Cause I don't fucking care
Tears fall to the ground
I just let them drown
Hey girl, open the walls 
Play with your dolls
We'll be a perfect family
When you walk away
Is when we really play
You don't hear me when I say
Mom, please wake up
Dad's with a slut
And your son is smoking cannabis
No one ever listens
This wallpaper glistens
Don't let them see what goes down in the kitchen
Places, places
Get in your places
Throw on your dress and put on your doll faces
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
Picture, picture, smile for the picture
Pose with your brother, won't you be a good sister?
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees
Hey girl, look at my mom
She's got it going on
Ha, you're blinded by her jewelry
When you turn your back
She pulls out a flask
And forgets his infidelity
Uh oh she's coming to the attic, plastic
Go back to being plastic
No one ever listens
This wallpaper glistens
Don't let them see what goes down in the kitchen
Places, places
Get in your places
Throw on your dress and put on your doll faces
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains

 Blood still stains when the sheets are washed
 Sex don't sleep when the lights are off
 Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
 And syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
 He's still dead when you're done with the bottle
 Of course it's a corpse that you keep in the cradle
 Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
 Syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
 Blood money, blood money
 How did you afford this ring that I love, honey?
 ""Just another shift at the drug company,"" 
 He doesn't think I'm that fucking dumb does he?
 It doesn't matter what you pull up to your home, we know what goes on inside
 You call that ass your own, we call that silicone
 Silly girl, we're silly, boys
 Blood still stains when the sheets are washed
 Sex don't sleep when the lights are off
 Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
 And syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
 He's still dead when you're done with the bottle
 Of course it's a corpse that you keep in the cradle
 Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
 Syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
 Sippy cup, s-s-sippy cup, in a sippy cup, sippy cup
 In a sippy cup, in a sippy cup, in a sippy cup, in a sippy cup
 Pill diet, pill diet, if they give you a new pill then you will buy it
 If they say to kill yourself, then you will try it
 All the makeup in the world, won't make you less insecure
 You got weights in your pockets, when you go to the doctor's
 Your favorite candy's cotton, that's why all your teeth are rotten
 Silly girl, we're silly, boys
 Blood still stains when the sheets are washed
 Sex don't sleep when the lights are off
 Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
 And syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
 He's still dead when you're done with the bottle
 Of course it's a corpse that you keep in the cradle
 Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
 Syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
 Sippy cup, s-s-sippy cup, in a sippy cup, sippy cup
 In a sippy cup, in a sippy cup, in a sippy cup, in a sippy cup
 Blood still stains when the sheets are washed
 Sex don't sleep when the lights are off
 Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
 And syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
Round and round like a horse on a carousel, we go
Will I catch up to love, I could never tell, I know
Chasing after you is like a fairytale, but I
Feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
Come, come one, come all, you must be this tall
To ride this ride at the carnival
Oh, come take my hand, and run through playland
So high, too high at the carnival
And it’s all fun and games, 'til somebody falls in love
But you've already bought a ticket, and there’s no turning back now
Round and round like a horse on a carousel, we go
Will I catch up to love, I could never tell, I know
Chasing after you is like a fairytale, but I
Feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
This horse is too slow, we’re always this close
Almost, almost, we’re a freakshow
Right, right when I’m near, it’s like you disappear
Where’d you go, is that Houdini or a freakshow
And it’s all fun and games, 'til somebody falls in love
But you've already bought a ticket, and there’s no turning back now
Round and round like a horse on a carousel, we go
Will I catch up to love, I could never tell, I know
Chasing after you is like a fairytale, but I
Feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
Why did you steal my cotton candy heart
You threw it in this damn coin slot
And now I’m stuck, I'm stuck
Riding, riding, riding
Round and round like a horse on a carousel, we go
Will I catch up to love, I could never tell, I know
Chasing after you is like a fairytale, but I
Feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
You're always aiming paper airplanes at me when you're around
You build me up like building blocks just so you can bring me down
You can crush my candy cane but you'll never catch me cry
If you dangle that diploma and I deck you, don't be surprised
I know my ABC's, yet you keep teaching me
I say, fuck your degree, alphabet boy
You think you're smarter than me with all your bad poetry
Fuck all your ABC's, alphabet boy
I'm not a little kid now
Watch me get big now
Spell my name on the fridge now
With all your alphabet toys
You won the spelling bee now
But are you smarter than me now?
You're the prince of the playground
Little alphabet boy
Apples aren't an always appropriate apologies
Butterscotch and bubblegum drops are bittersweet to me
You call me a child while you keep counting all your coins
But you're not my daddy and I'm not your dolly
And your dictionary's destroyed
I know my ABC's, yet you keep teaching me
I say, fuck your degree, alphabet boy
You think you're smarter than me with all your bad poetry
Fuck all your ABC's, alphabet boy
I'm not a little kid now
Watch me get big now
Spell my name on the fridge now
With all your alphabet toys
You won the spelling bee now
But are you smarter than me now?
You're the prince of the playground
Little alphabet boy

  Think I just remembered something
  I think I left the faucet running
   Now my words are filling up the tub
  Darling you're just soaking in it
  But I know you'll get out the minute
  You notice all your fingers 
pruning up
I'm tired of being careful, tip-toe, 
trying to keep the water warm
Let me under your skin
Uh oh there it goes, I said too much, it overflowed
Why do I always spill?
  I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
  God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap
  Think I got myself in trouble
  So I fill the bath with bubbles
  Then I'll put the towels all away
  Should've never said the word ""love""
  Threw a toaster in the bathtub
  I'm sick of all the games 
I have to play
I'm tired of being careful, tip-toe,
trying to keep the water warm
Let me under your skin
Uh oh there it goes, I said too much, it overflowed
Why do I always spill?
  I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
  God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap
Riding down, riding down
My hand on your seat
I carry band-aids on me now
For when your soft hands hit the jagged ground
Wheels aren't even touching the ground
Scared to take them off but they're so warm now
Promise I won't push you straight to the dirt
If you promise me you'll take them off first
I love everything you do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you  
I love everything you do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you  
Letting go, letting go
Telling you things you already know
I explode, I explode
Asking you where you want us to go
You've been riding two wheelers all your life
It's not like I'm asking to be your wife
I wanna make you mine, but that's hard to say
Is this coming off in a cheesy way?
I love everything you do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you  
I love everything you do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you  
I love everything you do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you  
I love everything you do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you
Did my invitations disappear
Why'd I put my heart on every cursive letter?
Tell me why the hell no one is here
Tell me what to do to make it all feel better
Maybe it's a cruel joke on me
Whatever, whatever
Just means there's way more cake for me
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
Maybe if I knew all of them well
I wouldn't have been trapped inside this hell that holds me
Maybe if I casted out a spell
But told them decorations were in pastel ribbons
Maybe it's a cruel joke on me
Whatever, whatever
Just means there's way more cake for me
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
I'm laughing, I'm crying
It feels like I'm dying
I'm laughing, I'm crying
It feels like I'm dying
I'm laughing, I'm crying
It feels like I'm dying
I'm dying, I'm dying
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
It's my party, it's-it's my party
It's my party, it's-it's my party
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
Looking at me through your window
Boy, you had your eye out for a little
""I'll cut you up and make you dinner
You've reached the end, you are the winner""
Rolling down your tinted window
Driving next to me real slow, he said
""Let me take you for a joyride
I've got some candy for you inside""
Running through the parking lot
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Grabbed my hand, pushed me down
Took the words right out my mouth
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Can anybody hear me? I'm hidden under ground
Can anybody hear me? Am I talking to myself?
Saying, ""tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it""
He's saying, ""tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it""
Little bit of poison in me
I can taste your skin in my teeth
""I love it when I hear you breathing
I hope to God you're never leaving""
Running through the parking lot
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Grabbed my hand, pushed me down
Took the words right out my mouth
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Can anybody hear me? I'm hidden under ground
Can anybody hear me? Am I talking to myself?
Saying, ""tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it""
He's saying, ""tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it""
Eenie meenie miny mo
Get your lady by her toes
If she screams, don't let her go
Eenie meenie miny mo
Your mother said to pick the very best girl
And I am
Running through the parking lot
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Grabbed my hand, pushed me down
Took the words right out my mouth
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Can anybody hear me? I'm hidden under ground
Can anybody hear me? Am I talking to myself?
Saying, ""tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it""
He's saying, ""tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it""
1,  2,   melatonin is coming for you
3,  4,   baby, won't you lock the door?
5,  6,   I'm done with it
7,  8, it's getting late, so close your eyes, sleep for days
 Hush, little baby, drink your spoiled milk
 I'm fucking crazy, need my prescription filled
 Do you like my cookies? They're made just for you
A little bit of sugar, but lots of poison, too
Ashes, ashes, time to go down
  Ooh, honey do you want me now?
  Can't take it anymore, need to put you to bed
  Sing you a lullaby where you die at the end
9,  10,   never want to see you again
11,  12,   I pull off black so well
Shit behind the curtain that I'm sick of sugarcoatin'
Next time you're alone, think fast when you grab the phone
Ashes, ashes, time to go down
  Ooh, honey do you want me now?
  Can't take it anymore, need to put you to bed
  Sing you a lullaby where you die at the end
Ashes, ashes, time to go down
  Ooh, honey do you want me now?
  Can't take it anymore, need to put you to bed
  Sing you a lullaby where you die at the end
Tired, blue boy walks my way
Holding a girls hand
That basic bitch leaves finally
Now I can take her man
  Someone told me stay away from things that aren’t yours
But was it yours, if he wanted me so bad?
  Pacify her
She’s getting on my nerves
Stop lying with those words 
  Pacify her
She’s getting on my nerves
Stop lying with those words
I can’t stand her whining
Where’s her binky now?
And loving her seems tiring
So boy, just love me, down, down, down
  Someone told me stay away from things that aren’t yours
But was it yours, if he wanted me so bad?
  Pacify her
She’s getting on my nerves
Stop lying with those words 
  Pacify her
She’s getting on my nerves
Stop lying with those words
  Pacify her
She’s getting on my nerves
  Pacify her
She’s getting on my nerves
Stop lying with those words 
  Pacify her
She’s getting on my nerves
Stop lying with those words
If you weren't born with it
You can buy a couple ornaments
Just be sure to read the warning, kids
Cause pretty soon you'll be bored of it
Sexual, hey girl if you wanna feel sexual
You can always call up a professional
They stick pins in you like a vegetable
Kids forever, kids forever
Baby soft skin turns into leather
Don't be dramatic it's only some plastic
  Oh Mrs. Potato Head tell me, 
  is it true that pain is beauty?
  Does a new face come with a warranty?
  Will a pretty face make it better?
  Oh Mr. Potato Head tell me
  How did you afford her surgery?
  Do you swear you'll stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
       Even if her face don't stay together
If you want a little more confidence
Potatoes turn to french fries, yeah it's common sense
All you need's a couple more condiments
And a hundred thousand dollars for some compliments
It's such a waste
When little girls grow into their mothers face
But little girls are learning how to cut and paste
And pucker up their lips until they suffocate
Kids forever, kids forever
Baby soft skin turns into leather
Don't be dramatic it's only some plastic
  Oh Mrs. Potato Head tell me, 
  is it true that pain is beauty?
  Does a new face come with a warranty?
  Will a pretty face make it better?
  Oh Mr. Potato Head tell me
  How did you afford her surgery?
  Do you swear you'll stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
  Oh Mrs. Potato Head tell me, 
  is it true that pain is beauty?
  Does a new face come with a warranty?
  Will a pretty face make it better?
  Oh Mr. Potato Head tell me
  How did you afford her surgery?
  Do you swear you'll stay forever
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
My friends don't walk they run
Skinny dip in rabbit holes for fun
Poppin' poppin' balloons with guns
Getting high off helium
We paint white roses red
Each shade from a different persons head
This dream dream is a killer
Getting drunk with the blue caterpillar
Now I'm peeling the skin off my face
Cause I really hate being safe
The normals they make me afraid
The crazy they make me feel sane
I'm nuts!
Baby, I'm mad
Craziest friend that you've ever had
You think I'm psycho
You think I'm gone
Tell the psychiatrist something is wrong
Over the bend
Entirely bonkers
You like me best when I'm off my rocker
Tell you a secret
I'm not alarmed
So what if I'm crazy?
The best people are
All the best people are crazy
All the best people are
Where is my prescription?
Doctor, doctor please listen
My brain is scattered
You can be Alice,
I'll be the mad hatter.
Now I'm peeling the skin off my face
Cause I really hate being safe
The normals they make me afraid
The crazy they make me feel sane
I'm nuts!
Baby, I'm mad
Craziest friend that you've ever had
You think I'm psycho
You think I'm gone
Tell the psychiatrist something is wrong
Over the bend
Entirely bonkers
You like me best when I'm off my rocker
Tell you a secret
I'm not alarmed
So what if I'm crazy?
The best people are
You think I'm crazy, you think I'm gone
So what if I'm crazy? All the best people are
And I think you're crazy too, I know you're gone
That's probably the reason that we get along
Now I'm peeling the skin off my face
Cause I really hate being safe
The normals they make me afraid
The crazy they make me feel sane
I'm nuts!
Baby, I'm mad
Craziest friend that you've ever had
You think I'm psycho
You think I'm gone

You call me on the telephone, you feel so far away
You tell me to come over there some games you want to play
I'm walking to your house, nobody's home
Its me and you, you and me alone
We're just playing hide and seek
It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
I don't wanna play no games
I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you
I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I give a shit 'bout you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you
Wake up in your bedroom and there's nothing left to say
When I try to talk you're always playing board games
I wish I had monopoly over your mind
I wish I didn't care all the time
We're just playing hide and seek
It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
I don't wanna play no games
I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you
I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I give a shit 'bout you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you
Ring around the rosy
I never know, I never know what you need
Ring around the rosy, I wanna give you, wanna give you
I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I give a shit 'bout you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you
You know I give a fuck about you every day
Guess it's time that I tell you the truth
If I share my toys, will you let me stay?
Don't wanna leave this play date with you
  Stitched you up, put you together
With cotton and feather
  Gave you love, put my heart inside you
Oh what could I do
When you started talking in your sleep
Saying things you'd do to me
I didn't care
Now I'm finding knives under the sheets
Crumbled photographs of me
I'm in despair
Teddy bear, you are my teddy bear
You were comforting and quiet
How did love become so violent?
Oh, teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
Everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me
  I threw you out, I didn't outgrow you
I just didn't know you
  But now you're back
And it's so terrifying how you paralyze me
Now you showing up inside my home
Breathing deep into the phone
I'm so unprepared
Teddy bear, you are my teddy bear
You were comforting and quiet
How did love become so violent?
Oh, teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
Everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me
I'm fucking scared
Teddy bear, you are my teddy bear
You were comforting and quiet
How did love become so violent?
Oh, teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
Everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me

Your skin is warm like an oven
Your kiss is sugary sweet
Your fingers feel like cotton
When you put your arms around me
It feels like I'm just missing
Something whenever you leave
We've got all the ingredients
Except you loving me
 And respectfully
I'm not a piece of cake
For you to just discard
While you walk away
With the frosting of my heart
So I'm taking back
What's mine, you'll miss
The slice of heaven that
I gave to you last night
You smell just like vanilla
You taste like buttercream
You're filling up my senses
With empty calories
It feels like I'm just missing
Something whenever you leave
We've got all the ingredients
Except you needing me
 And respectfully
I'm not a piece of cake
For you to just discard
While you walk away
With the frosting of my heart
So I'm taking back
What's mine, you'll miss
The slice of heaven that
I gave to you last night
If I am just a piece of cake
I am just a piece of cake
Then, you're just a piece of meat
You're just a piece of meat to me
I'm not a piece of cake
For you to just discard
While you walk away
With the frosting of my heart
So I'm taking back
What's mine, you'll miss
The slice of heaven that
I gave to you last night
The slice of heaven that I gave
S-S-Slice of heaven that I gave to you
The Slice of heaven
That I gave to you
Last night

Time moved too fast, you play it back
Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke
No proof not much, but you saw enough
Small talk, he drives coffee at midnight, 
the light reflects, the chain on your neck
 He says look up and your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch you felt enough
 You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out, you
You're in love, true love
You're in love
Morning, his place burn toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
And for once you let go, of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kissed on sidewalks, you fight and you talk
One night he wakes, strange look on his face
Pauses, then says, you're my best friend
And you knew what it was, he is in love
 You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out, you
You're in love, true love
And so it goes
And he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown
 And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
 And why I've spent my whole life try to put it into words
 Cause you can hear in the silence
 You can feel it on the way home
 You can see it with the lights out

Everyday I'm a slave to the heartache
And you're wasting away every night
I don't wanna leave you lonely

Hope you'll be safe in the arms of another

As second sun came past the glass

It is not something that we'll need

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance alone in the light of day?
And head back to the Milky Way
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
Did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you’re wrong
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me
Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance alone in the light of day?
And head back toward the Milky Way
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there?
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know you’re wrong
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance five-hour phone conversation

But then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar
Sometimes I wonder
And any other summer could you have been my part time lover
Under the covers where we used to lay
And ""Re: Stacks"" is what the speakers play
 I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching the DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We'd use each other's air just for the people to see                                                  
We go anywhere, our minds would take us
And I'd say you were beautiful without your make-up
And you don't even need to worry about your weight 'cause
We can all be loved the way God made us
At times the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane
Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina 
'Cause that's you and me both
Nina oh, won't you leave me now, now
And every weekend in the winter
You'd be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight
Where we'd eat on our own
'Cause every day when I was away
Watching Blue Planet
Creating new habits
Acting as if we was two rabbits
Back to burrow with all of the Celtics, I'd disappear
You'd call me selfish, I understand
I put my job over everything
Except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever                                         
Overlook the situation
'Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it's too late
So we can either to deal with the pain
And wait to get on a plane
Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina

But you can make it on your own
Sing that song, go, oh won't you leave me now

But you can't mend your broken heart 
Take it back oh, oh won't you leave me now

Niets is beter dan met jou de kou trotseren
Er zijn mensen die naar warme landen emigreren
Maar we hebben geen geld in onze koude handen
Dus we gaan maar naar je ouders in Zoutelande
In zoutelande
En dan zitten we hier in het oude strandhuis
Wat je vertelt houdt me nuchter en warm
Boven m’n hoofd zie ik de grijze wolken
Ik ben blij dat je hier bent, blij dat je hier bent
Wij zitten hier in het gammele strandhuis
Maakte me toch al nooit uit waar we waar
We verzuipen onszelf in de drank van je vader
Ik ben blij dat je hier bent, blij dat je hier bent
Niets is mooier dan met jou het land doorkruisen
Op mistroostige plekken je bij me te hebben
En te zien dat het goed is, ziet dat we bruisen
En met wodka en met bokking        tussen reddingsbanden
Ahaa
En dan zitten we hier in het oude strandhuis
Wat je vertelt houdt me nuchter en warm
Boven m’n hoofd zie ik de grijze wolken
Ik ben blij dat je hier bent, blij dat je hier bent
Wij zitten hier in het gammele strandhuis
Maakte me toch al nooit uit waar we waren
We verzuipen onszelf in de drank van je vader
Ik ben blij dat je hier bent, blij dat je hier bent
Ik ben blij dat je hier bent
Ik ben blij dat je hier bent
Ik ben blij dat je hier bent
Ik ben blij dat je hier bent
En dan zitten we hier in het oude strandhuis
Wat je vertelt houdt me nuchter en warm
Boven m’n hoofd zie ik de grijze wolken
Ik ben blij dat je hier bent, blij dat je hier bent
          Ik ben blij dat je hier bent
Ik ben blij dat je hier bent
Ik ben blij dat je hier bent
Wij zitten hier in het gammele strandhuis
Maakte me toch al nooit uit waar we waar
We verzuipen onszelf in de drank van je vader
Ik ben blij dat je hier bent, blij dat je hier bent

Doing on the other side?
And so, just tell me what 
You're doing with that other guy?
Cause I ain't got patience to
Slow down the bass all your
Girlfriends are wasted
They need it, they chase it
Face it you want it, you crave it
Believe when I say that you'll know 
Once you taste it
All of your friends have been 
Here for too long
They must be waiting for you to move on
Girl, I'm not with it 
I'm way too far gone
I'm not ready, eyes heavy now
Heart on your sleeve like 
You've never been loved
Running in circles, now look what you've done
Give you my word as you 
Take it and run
Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now 
Took to make some time and space to realize
That you were busy lying 
Sleeping 'round with other guys
And what the hell were we?
Tell me we weren't just friends
This doesn't make much sense, no
But I'm not hurt, I'm tense
Cause I'll be fine without you babe
All of your friends have been 
Here for too long
They must be waiting for you to move on
Girl, I'm not with it 
I'm way too far gone
I'm not ready, eyes heavy now
Heart on your sleeve like

   Ask you once, ask you twice now
There's lipstick on your collar
You say she's just a friend now
Then why don't we call her
So you want to go on with someone
To do all the things you used to do to me
I swear, I know you do
Used to take me out, in your fancy car
And make out in the rain
And when I ring you up
Don't know where you are
'Til I hear her say your name
Used to sing along, when you played guitar
Just a distant memory
Hope she treats you better than you treated me, ha
I'm onto you, yeah you
I'm not your number one
I saw you, with her
Kissing and having fun
If you're giving her all your money and time
I'm not gonna sit here wasting mine on you, yeah, you

Ciao adios, I'm done

Why did I bother?
Tell me how many more times
Does it take to get smarter?
Don't need to deny the hurt and the lies
And all of the things you did to me
I swear, I know you did
And now you take her out, in your fancy car
And you make out in the rain
And when she rings you up
She know where you are
But I know differently
Now she sings along, when you play guitar
Making brand new memories
Hope you treat her better than you treated me

Je suis facteur du ciel pour l’aéropostale
Je regarde le monde depuis mon appareil
C’est beau comme vu d’ici on a tous l’air pareil
Je rêve dans mon ciel solitaire
Qu’on soit tous un peu solidaire
Voler de nuit comme St Exupéry
Voir le monde d’en haut sans le prendre de haut
Voler de nuit, voir ce qui nous unis
Sonner l’écho que nous sommes tous égaux
Vu d’en haut ces frontières, ces lignes qui nous écartent
Ne sont que des dessins, des traits sur la carte
Derrière chaque maison, des gens rêvent, des gens s’aiment
C’est beau vu d’avion qu’on a l’air tous les mêmes
Je pense à ça dans mon ciel si vide
En bas éclatent des guerres civiles
Voler de nuit comme St Exupéry
Voir le monde d’en haut sans le prendre de haut
Voler de nuit, voir ce qui nous unis
Sonner l’écho que nous sommes tous égaux
Si je suis descendu, je ne regretterai rien
J’étais fait pour planter des fleurs dans un jardin
Certain soir il me semble entendre dans le cockpit
Comme une voix d’enfant entre les parasites
Un enfant qui dit s’il vous plait… Monsieur, dessine-moi la terre
(Dessine-moi... la terre)
(Dessine-moi ... la terre)
Voler de nuit comme St Exupéry
Voir le monde d’en haut sans le prendre de haut
Voler de nuit, voir ce qui nous unis
Rêver dans l’ombre le réveil du monde

  She may contain the urge to run away
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
  Citrezene, your fever’s gripped me again
Never kisses, all you ever send are full stops, la la la la
  Do you know where the wild things go
They go along to take your honey, la la la la
 Break down now weep, build up breakfast now
Let’s eat my love, my love love love, la la la la
  Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
  The fear has gripped me but here I go
  My heart sinks as I jump up
  Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut
Aaah aaah aaah ah-ah
Aaah aaah aaah ah-ah-ah     ah
  Do you know where the wild things go
They go along to take your honey, la la la la
 Break down now sleep, build up breakfast now
Let’s eat my love, my love, love-love, la la la la
 She bruises coughs, she splutters pistol shots
Hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks, la la la la
  She’s morphine, queen of my vaccine
My love, my love, love, love, la la la la
  Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
  The fear has gripped me but here I go
  My heart sinks as I jump up
  Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut
Aaah aaah aaah ah-ah
Aaah aaah aaah ah-ah-ah
Aaah aaah aaah ah-ah
Aaah aaah aaah ah-ah-ah     ah
  She may contain the urge to run away
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
  Germaline, disinfect the scene
My love, my love love love
Please don’t go, I love you so...
My lovely
Please don’t go, please don’t go, I love you so, I love you so
Please don’t go, please don’t go, I love you so, I love you so, please break my heart, ah (hey)
Please don’t go, please don’t go, I love you so, I love you so
Please don’t go, please don’t go, I love you so, I love you so, please break my heart, ah
Please don’t go, I’ll eat you whole
 I love you so,  I love you so, I love you so
Please don’t go,               I’ll eat you whole
 I love you so
Please don’t go,               I’ll eat you whole
 I love you so,  I love you so, I love you so
Please don’t go,               I’ll eat you whole
 I love you so, I love you so
Please don’t go, I’ll eat you whole
 I love you so,  I love you so, I love you so
Please don’t go,               I’ll eat you whole
 I love you so
Please don’t go,               I’ll eat you whole
 I love you so,  I love you so, I love you so

1,Norman Fucking Rockwell Album,Lana Del Rey,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lana-del-rey/norman-fucking-rockwell-chords-2803880,"  Goddamn, man-child
  You fucked me so good that I almost said, ""I love you""
  You're fun and you're wild
  But you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through
   Your poetry's bad and you blame the news
   But I can't change that, and I can't change your mood
  'Cause you're just a man, it's just what you do
Your head in your hands as you color me blue
  Yeah, you're just a man, all through and through
Your head in your hands as you color me blue
  Blue, blue, blue
  Goddamn, man-child
  You act like a kid even though you stand six foot two
  Self-loathing poet, resident Laurel Canyon know-it-all
  You talk to the walls when the party gets bored of you
   But I don't get bored, I just see you through
   Why wait for the best when I could have you?
  'Cause you're just a man, it's just what you do
Your head in your hands as you color me blue
  Yeah, you're just a man, all through and through
Your head in your hands as you color me blue
  Blue, blue
You make me blue---, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh
Blue, blue, blue
  You took my sadness out of context
   At the Mariners apartment complex
  I ain't no candle in the wind
  I'm the board, the lightning, the thunder
   Kind of girl who's gonna make you wonder
  Who you are and who you've been
  And who I've been is with you on these beaches
   Your Venice bitch, your die-hard, your weakness
  Maybe I could save you from your sins
So, kiss the sky and whisper to Jesus
   My, my, my, you found this, you need this
  Take a deep breath, baby, let me in
   You lose your way, just take my hand
   You're lost at sea then I'll command your boat to me again
   Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
      I'm your man
      I'm your man
  They mistook my kindness for weakness
   I fucked up, I know that, but Jesus
  Can't a girl just do the best she can?
  Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
   Think about it, the darkness, the deepness
  All the things that make me who I am
  And who I am is a big time believer
That people can change, but you don't have to leave her
When everyone's talking, you can make a stand
'Cause even in the dark I feel your resistance
You can see my heart burning in the distance
Baby, baby, baby, I'm your man, yeah
   You lose your way, just take my hand
   You' re lost at sea then I'll command your boat to me again
   Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
      I'm your man
      I'm your man
  Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
     Take in the sweetness, you want this, you need this
     Are you ready for it, are you ready for it, are you ready for it?
Fear fun, fear love, fresh out of fucks, forever
Tryin' to be stronger for you
Ice cream, ice queen, I dream in jeans and leather
Life's dream, I'm sweet for you
   Oh god, miss you on my lips
   It's me, your little Venice bitch
   On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
   Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss
  You're in the yard, I light the fire
And as the summer fades away, nothing gold can stay
  You write, I tour, we make it work
You're beautiful and I'm insane, we're American-made
Give me hallmark, one dream, one life, one lover
Paint me happy and blue
Norman Rockwell, no hype under our covers
It's just me and you
   Oh god, miss you on my lips
   It's me, your little Venice bitch
   On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
   Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss
  You're in the yard, I light the fire
And as the summer fades away, nothing gold can stay
  You write, I tour, we make it work
You're beautiful and I'm insane, we're American-made

   You heard my baby's back in town now
   You should come, come over
   We'll be hanging around now
   You should come, come over
   Oh god, I love him on my lips
   It's me, your little Venice bitch
   Touch me with your fingertips
   It's me, your little Venice bitch
   Back, back in the garden
We're getting high now, because we're older
   Me, myself, I like diamonds
   My baby, crimson and clover
La-la-la-la-la-la, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

   Crimson and clover, honey,  over and over, honey
   Over and over, honey,  over and over, honey
   Over and over, honey,  over and over
   If you weren't mine, I'd be jealous of your love
   If you weren't mine, I'd be jealous of your love
   If you weren't mine, I'd be jealous of your love
   If you weren't mine, I'd be jealous of your love
   If you weren't mine, I'd be jealous of your love
   I like to see everything in neon
Drink  lime green, stay up 'til dawn
Maybe  the way that I'm living is killing me
   I like to light up the stage with a song
Do shit to keep me turned on
But  one day, I woke up like “maybe  I'll do it differently” so
I moved to California but it's just a state of mind
It  turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself‚ that's not a lie
Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
It's killing me slowly-y
  Dream a little dream of me, make  me into something sweet
Turn the radio on‚ dancin' to a pop song
Fuck it I love you, fuck it I love you
Fuck it I love you, I really do
   I used to shoot up my veins in neon
And shit's even brighter, you're gone
So many things I would say to you, I want you
You moved to California but it's just a state of mind
And you know everyone adores you, you can't feel it and you're tired
Baby‚ wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
But it's killing me slowly
  Dream a little dream of me, turn this into something sweet
Turn the radio on‚ dancing to a pop song
Fuck it I love you, fuck it I love you
Fuck it I love you, I really do
It turns out California's more than just a state of mind
I met you on the boulevard but you're not here, you blew my mind
And if I wasn't so fucked up, I think I'd fuck you all the time
It's killing me slowly
               I moved to California but it's just a state of mind
    It turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that's not a lie
               I wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
     It's killing me slowly
                 California dreamin', got my money on my mind
                 Jazz is in my veins, running out of time
                 California dreamin', got my money on my mind
          Jazz is in my veins, running out of time
                 California dreamin', got my money on my mind
                 Jazz is in my veins, running out of time
                 California dreamin', got my money on my mind
          Jazz is in my veins, running out of time
Summertime,   and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree that we're
Well-qualified to represent the L.B.C
Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
   Me and my girl, we got this relationship
   I love her so bad, but she treats me like shit
   On lockdown, like a penitentiary
She spreads her lovin' all over and when she gets home
There's none left for me
Summertime,   and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree that we're
Well-qualified to represent the L.B.C
Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder
   Oh take this veil from off my eyes
   My burning sun will someday rise
So what am I gonna be doin' for a while?
Said I'm gonna play with myself
Show them how we've come off the shelf
Summertime,   and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree that we're
Well-qualified to represent the L.B.C
Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder
Evil, I've come to tell you that she's evil, most definitely
Evil, ornery, scandalous and evil, most definitely
The tension,   it's getting hotter
I'd like to hold her,   head underwater
(Summertime)
  (Ah, ah, ah)
Summertime,   and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree that we're
Well-qualified to represent the L.B.C
Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
  In the car, in the car, in the backseat, I'm your baby
  We go fast, we go so fast, we don't move
  I believe in a place you take me, make you real proud of your baby
  In your car, I'm a star and I'm burnin' through you
  In your car, I'm a star and I'm burnin' through you
Oh, be my once in a lifetime
Lying on your chest in my party dress, I'm a fuckin' mess but I
Oh, thanks for the high life
Baby it's the best, passed the test and yes, now I'm here with you and I
Would like to think that you would stick around
You know that I’d just die to make you proud
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song
  Dream a dream, here's a scene, touch me anywhere 'cause I'm your baby
  Grab my waist, don't waste any part
  I believe that you see me for who I am
  So spill my clothes on the floor of your new car
  Is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are?
  Is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are?
Oh, be my once in a lifetime
Lying on your chest in my party dress, I'm a fuckin' mess but I
Oh, thanks for the high life
Baby it's the best, passed the test and yes, now I'm here with you and I
Would like to think that you would stick around
You know that I’d just die to make you proud
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song
   Cinnamon in my teeth
From your kiss, you're touching me
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work
You try to push me out, but I just find my way back in
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me out, I win
There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you leave
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
   Kerosene in my hands
You make me mad, I'm fire again
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work
There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you leave
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you leave
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
John met me down at the boulevard
I cried on his shoulder 'cause life is hard
The waves came in over my head
What you been up to my baby?
I haven't seen you 'round here lately
All of the guys tell me lies but you don't
You just -- crack another beer
And pretend that you're still here
  This is how - to - disappear
This is how - to disappear
Jim met me down at the training yard
Got cuts on his face 'cause he fought too hard
I know he's in over his head
But I love that man like nobody can
He moves mountains and turns them to ground again
And I watched the guys getting high as they fight
For the -- things that they hold dear
To forget the things they fear
  And this is how - they - disappear
This is how - they - disappear
Well now it's been years since I left New York
And I've got a kid and two cats in the yard
The California sun and the movie stars
And I watched the skies getting light as I write
As I -- think about those years
And I whisper in your ear
  I'm always goin' - to - be right here--
No one's goin' ----- anywhere
I'm always goin' - to - be right here--
No one's goin' - anywhere
   You don't ever have to
Be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms
Baby, you don't ever have to
Go faster than your fastest pace
Or faster than my fastest cars
I shouldn't have done it but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to reach out but I never said a thing
I shouldn't have done it but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to call you but I didn't say a thing (two, three, four)
Ohh-oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flipside
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever, have fun
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we'll dance till dawn
I'll pick up all of your Vogues and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top-shelf
I'll throw a party, all night long
   You don't ever have to
Be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms
And honey, you don't ever have to
Act cooler than you think you should
You're brighter than the brightest stars
You're scared to win, scared to lose
I've heard the war was over if you really choose
The one in and around you
You hate the heat, you got the blues
You're changing like the weather, oh, that's so like you
The Santa Ana moves you (two, three, four)
Ohh-oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flipside
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever, have fun
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we'll dance till dawn
I'll pick up all of your Vogues and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top-shelf
I'll throw a party, all night long
Ohh-oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flipside
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
To the Houses of the Holy, smokin' on them cigarettes
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was cool as heck, he was cool as heck
And we were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
That we give all we had ’til the time we got to bed 'cause we knew we could
We were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
'Cause we were just that good, it was just that good
Whatever’s on tonight‚ I just wanna party with you
Topanga's hot tonight‚ I'm taking off my bathing suit
You made me feel like there's something that I never knew
I wanted
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was '70s in spirit‚ '90s in his frame of mind
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
We lost track of space, we lost track of time
And we were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
That we give all we had ’til the time we got to bed 'cause we knew we could
We were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
'Cause we were just that good, it was just that good
Whatever’s on tonight‚ I just wanna party with you
Topanga's hot tonight‚ I'm taking off my bathing suit
You made me feel like there's something that I never knew
I wanted, we play the Eagles down in Malibu
And I want it
It's you‚ all the roads lead to you
Everything I want and do, all the things that I say
It's true, all the roads lead to you
Like the 405 I drive through, every night and every day
I-i i-i i-i i-i see you for who you really are
Why the thousands of girls love, the way Bill plays guitar
Whatever’s on tonight‚ I just wanna party with you
Topanga's hot tonight‚ I'm taking off my bathing suit
You made me feel like there's something that I never knew
I wanted, we play the Eagles down in Malibu
And I want it, there's something that I never knew
I want it
  I miss Long Beach and I miss you, babe
   I miss dancing with you the most of all
  And I miss the bar where the Beach Boys would go
   Dennis's last stop before Kokomo
   Those nights were on fire, we couldn't get higher
We didn't know that we had it  all
But nobody warns you before the fall
And I'm  wa-a-a-a-a-a----asted
      Don't leave‚ I just need a wake-up call
I'm fa-a-a-a--cing the greatest
      The greatest loss of them all
   The culture is lit and I had a ball
   I guess I'm signing off after all
  I miss New York and I miss the music
   Me and my friends‚ we miss rock 'n' roll
  I want shit to feel just like it used to
When baby, I was doing nothing the most of all
   The culture is lit and if this is it
I had a ba-a-a-a---a---all
I guess that I'm burned out after all
I'm  wa-a-a-a-a-a----asted
      Don't leave‚ I just need a wake-up call
I'm fa-a-a-a--cing the greatest
      The greatest loss of them all
   The culture is lit and I had a ball
   I guess that I'm burned out after all
   If this is it, I'm signing off
   Miss doing nothing, the most of all
   Hawaii just missed a fireball
   L.A. is in flames‚ it's getting hot
   Kanye West is blond and gone
   ""Life on Mars?"" ain't just a song
   I hope the livestream's almost on
   All the ladies of the canyon
  Wearing black to their house parties
   Crosby, Stills and Nash is playing
  Wine is flowing with Bacardi
   But sometimes,   girls just
   Want to have fun
   The poetry,   inside of me
   Is warm like a gun
I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
It'll buy me a year if I play my cards right
Photo free exits from baby's bedside
'Cause they don't yet know what car I drive
I'm just tryna keep my love alive
With my bartender, hold me all night
Bartender, our love's alive
Baby remember, I'm not drinking wine
But that cherry coke you serve is fine
And our love's sweet enough on the vine
Bartender,   bar-t-t-tender
   All the ladies of the canyon
  Wearing white for their tea parties
   Playing games of levitation
  Meditating in the garden
   And I love,   the little games that we play
From the valley to the beach
   And when at last,   the day is done
   I grab my keys
I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
It'll buy me a year if I play my cards right
Photo free exits from baby's bedside
'Cause they don't yet know what car I drive
I'm just tryna keep my love alive
With my bartender, hold me all night
Bartender, our love's alive
Baby remember, I'm not drinking wine
But that cherry coke you serve is fine
And our love's sweet enough on the vine
Bar-t-t-tender, bar-t-t-tender
Bar-t-t-tender, ha ha ha ha
I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
60 mph on PCH drive
Here to Long Beach to Newport by your side
As they don't yet know where I reside
60 miles from the last place I hide
With my bar-t-t-tender, hold me all night
Bar-t-t-tender, keep love alive
Bar-t-t-tender
  Do you want me or do you not?
I heard one thing, now I'm hearing another
  Dropped a pin to my parking spot
The bar was hot, it's 2am, it feels like summer
   Happiness is a butterfly, try to catch it like every night
   It escapes from my hands into moonlight
   Everyday is a lullaby, hum it on the phone like every night
   And sing it for my babies on the tour life, ah-ah ah
  If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt, I'm already hurt
  If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt, he's already hurt
I said, ""Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi""
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat
Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the
Avenue-hoo-hoo hoo, I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance, baby,     I just wanna dance
      Dance, baby, I just wanna dance
  Left the canyon, drove to the club
I was one thing, now I'm being another
  Laurel down to Sunset in the truck
I'll pick you up if you're in town, on the corner, ah-ah ha-ha
   Happiness is a butterfly, we should catch it while dancing
I lose myself in the music, ba-—by
   Everyday is a lullaby, try to catch it like lightning
I sing it into my music, I'm cra-zy
  If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt, I'm already hurt
  If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt, he's already hurt
I said, ""Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi""
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat
Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh, I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the
Avenue-hoo-hoo hoo, I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance, baby,     I just wanna dance
      Dance, baby, I just wanna dance
I was reading Slim Aarons and I got to thinking that I thought
Maybe I'd get less stressed if I was tested less like all of these debutantes
Smiling for miles in pink dresses and high heels on white yachts
But I'm not, baby I'm not
No, I'm not that, I'm not
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown, twenty-four seven, Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on the walls 'cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad
Don't ask if I'm happy, you know that I'm not, but at best I can say I'm not sad
'Cause hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
I had fifteen-year dances, church basement romances, yeah I've cried
Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums is the only love I've ever known
Except for the stage which I also call home when I'm not
Servin' up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
Hello, it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad
Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, ""Hi, Dad""
I've been tearing up town in my fucking white gown like a goddamn near sociopath
Shaking my ass is the only thing that's got this black narcissist off my back
She couldn't care less and I never cared more so there's no more to say about that
Except hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past
There's a new revolution, a loud evolution that I saw
Born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly I've known
A modern day woman with a weak constitution 'cause I've got
Monsters still under my bed that I could never fight off
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown, twenty-four seven, Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on your walls 'cause the ink in my pen don't look good in my pad
They write that I'm happy, they know that I'm not but at best, you can see I'm not sad
But hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
But I have it, yeah I have it
Yeah, I have it, I have

Walked into the room you know you made my eyes burn
It was like, James Dean, for sure
You so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
But you fit me better than my favourite sweater, and I know
That love is mean, and love hurts
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby!
I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears
Love you more, than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh baby, say you'll remember
I will love you till the end of time
Big dreams, Gangster
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like: ""No please"", ""Stay here""
""We don't need no money we can make it all work""
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipating and pacing but he was
Chasing, Paper
""Caught up in the game"" that was the last I heard
I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a milion years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears
Love you more, Than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh baby, say you'll remember
I will love you till the end of time
He went out every night, And baby that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did, I'd be by your side
Cause I'm a ride or die, Whether you fail or fly,
Well shit at least you tried.
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
I told you I wanted more, but that not what I had in mind
I just want it like before, We were dancing all night
Then they took you away, - stole you out of my life
You just need to remember...
I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a milion years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears
Love you more, Than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh baby, say you'll remember
I will love you till the end of time

Your words cut deeper than a knife

Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe

I'm tripping over myself,
I'm aching begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses

Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow

Made memories we knew would never fade

Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid.""

So live a life you will remember.""

Light a fire they can't put out
Carve your name into those shining stars

And people who talk too much

As if no one knows anything but us
And should this be the last thing I see

Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

My hands are gently intertwined, a feeling I just can't describe.
All this time we spent alone, thinking we could not belong,
To something so damn beautiful, so damn beautiful.

And he was in a hurry to be touching her skin
She's feeling kind of dirty when she's dancing with him
Forgetting what she told me by the water fountain
Now he's grabbing her hips and pulling her in
Kissing her lips and whispering in her
Ear and she knows that she shouldn't listen
And that she should be with me by the water fountain
She couldn't be at home in the nighttime because
It made her feel alone but at that time she was

I should have built a home with a fountain for us

45,Habibi,Tamino,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tamino/habibi-chords-2039613,"Something hides in every night
Brings desire from the deep
And with it comes a burning light
To keep us from our sleep
And as the full star tries his best to make the white pearl shine
Glances of a new day have arrived
And though he's not alone, he fears to never love another
And leave his heart forever with her smile
Ha-
Habibi, light is burning
As I am burning
Habibi, light is burning
As I am yearning
Something died within a soul
Left the eyes to rust
And every time it is recalled
It covers all in dust
Habibi, light is burning
As I am burning
Habibi, light is burning
As I am yearning
And meanwhile, a whole lot goes down
Somewhere in the darkness, us together for a while
You loved it then, so did I
A feeling deep inside you wants to love it all again
Now don't leave it there, just give it a chance
If only I'd forget you after one last dance
But you're everywhere, yes you are
In every melody and in every little scar
Yes you are, you are
Habibi, light is burning
As I am burning
Habibi, light is burning
And I am yearning

and at first I thought it was a lie
I took all of my things that make sounds
the rest I can do without
I don't want your body but I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold, you're intertwining your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you while you're looking through your phone and then leaving with somebody else
oh, I don't want your body but I'm picturing your body with somebody else
Come on baby, this ain't the last time that I'll see your face
Come on baby, you said you'd find someone to take my place
Oh I just don't believe that you have got it in you cos we are just gonna keep 'doin it'
and everytime I start to believe in anything you're saying I'm reminded that I should be getting over it
I don't want your body but I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold, you're intertwining your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you while you're looking through your phone and then leaving with somebody else
oh, I don't want your body but I'm picturing your body with somebody else
Get someone you love? Get someone you need? Fuck that, get money
I can't give you my soul, cos we're never alone
I don't want your body but I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold, you're intertwining your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you while you're looking through your phone and then leaving with somebody else

There's never been a moment
You were forgotten
You are not hopeless
Though you have been broken
Your innocence stolen
I hear you whisper underneath your breath
I hear your SOS, your SOS
I will send out an army to find you
In the middle of the darkest night
It's true, I will rescue you
There is no distance
That cannot be covered
Over and over
You're not defenseless
I'll be your shelter
I'll be your armor
I hear you whisper underneath your breath
I hear your SOS, your SOS
I will send out an army to find you
In the middle of the darkest night
It's true, I will rescue you
I will never stop marching to reach you
In the middle of the hardest fight

It's true, I will rescue you

Then I go to sex clubs
Watching freaky people getting it on
It doesn't make me nervous
If anything I'm restless 
Yeah I've been around and I've seen it all 
I get home, I got the munchies
Binge on all my Twinkies
Throw up in the tub, then I go to sleep
And I drank up all my money 
Tasted kind of lonely 
You're gone and I got to stay high 
All the time to keep you off my mind Ooooo Oooooo
High all the time to keep you off my mind Ooooo Oooooo
Spend my days locked in a haze 
Trying to forget you babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you Ooooo Oooooo
Pick up daddy's at the playground
How I spend my day time
Loosen up the frown, make them feel alive 
I make it fast and greasy
I know I'm way too easy
You're gone and I got to stay high 
All the time to keep you off my mind Ooooo Oooooo
High all the time to keep you off my mind Ooooo Oooooo
Spend my days locked in a haze 
Trying to forget you babe, I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life to forget I'm missing you Ooooo Oooooo
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Standing in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain

the other woman is perfect where rival fails,
and she's never seen with pin curls in her hair anywhere.
The other woman enchants her clothes with french perfume,
the other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room,
there are never toys that's scattered everywhere.
And when her old man comes to call,
he'll find her waiting like a lonesome queen.
'Cause to be by her side...   is such a change from old rutine.
But the other woman       Will always cry herself to sleep.

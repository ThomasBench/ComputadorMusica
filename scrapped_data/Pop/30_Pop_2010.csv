0,I Forgot That You Existed,Taylor Swift,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/taylor-swift/i-forgot-that-you-existed-chords-2802887,"  How many days did I spent thinking 'bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
  Lived in the shade you were throwing till all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone
       And I couldn't get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
   Free rent, living in my mind
  But then something happened one magical night
I forgot that you existed
    And I thought that it would kill me but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
   It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
Got out some popcorn as soon as my rep started going down, down, down
  Laughed on the school yard as soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
   And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town so yeah
Would've been right there front row
   Even if nobody came to your show
  But you showed who you are then one magical night
I forgot that you existed
    And I thought that it would kill me but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
   It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
  Sent me a clear message
  Taught me some hard lessons
  I just forget what they were
  It's all just a blur
I forgot that you existed
    And I thought that it would kill me but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
I did, I did, I did
It isn't hate, it's just indifference
   It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference, so yeah

Even if we used to be more?
Like lovers or partners in crime
And you were still mine
You said we should get out
While we still could 
And I shoulda listened 
But I misunderstood 
Thought you wanted me tied down 
I started to chafe 
But it's easy to see now
You just wanted me safe
And when the cops broke down our door
And held us both against our floor
Did we look like lovers or partners in crime?
Did you look like mine?
Or did we look like fools
Tryna get away with it all?
Thinkin' we'd be saved by a call
For each other
We were on the same boat
Didn't see you for ages
Didn't pick up your phone 
Made it out of our cages 
Never made it back home 
I was late to the party 
Of an old family friend 
I was lookin' for parkin'
Thought I saw you again
Someone I've seen before

Or a partner in crime
Or something of mine

 I wish I had a better voice to sing some better words
 I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
 I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang

 But now I'm insecure and I care what people think
 My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
 My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

 Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
 How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from
 I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
 Try to sell it, never sell out of it
 I'd probably only sell one
 It'd be to my brother 'cause we have the same nose
 Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
 But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
 Out of student loans and treehouse homes we all would take the latter
 My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
 My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

  And it's peaceful in the deep, cathedral where you cannot 
  Breathe no need to pray no need to speak, now i am under.
  Oh and it's breaking over me, a thousand miles down to the sea
  Bed, I found a place to rest my head 
And the arms of the ocean are carrying me,
And all this devotion was rushing out of me,
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner like me,
But the arms of the ocean delivered me.
  Though the pressure's hard to take, it's the only way i can escape,
  It seems a heavy choice to make, now i am under.

And the arms of the ocean are carrying me,
And all this devotion was rushing out of me,
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner like me,
But the arms of the ocean delivered me.
  And it's over, and i'm going under,
  But i'm not giving up, i'm just giving in,
  Whoaaa, slipping underneath,
  ooooo, so cold but so sweet.
  In the arms, of the ocean, so sweet and so cold,
  And all this devotion, i never knew at all,
  And the crushes are heaven, for a sinner released,
  And the arms of the ocean...
  Delivered me..

Whistling my name
Open up a beer
And you take it over here
And play a video game
I'm in his favorite sun dress
Watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown
I say you the bestest
Lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite perfume on
Go play a video game
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby now you do
Singing in the old bars
Swinging with the old stars
Living for the fame
Kissing in the blue dark
Playing pool and wild darts
Video games
He holds me in his big arms
Drunk and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of
Watching all our friends fall
In and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playing video games

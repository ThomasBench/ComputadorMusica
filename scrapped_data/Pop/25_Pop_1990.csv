0,All This Time,Sting,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/sting/all-this-time-chords-84267,"I looked out across
The river today,
I saw a city in the fog and an old church tower
Where the seagulls play,
I saw the sad shire horses walking home
In the sodium light
I saw two priests on the ferry
October geese on a cold winter's night
And all this time,
The river flowed
Endlessly to the sea.
And all this time,
The river flowed
Endlessly to the sea.
And all this time
The river flowed
Endlessly to the sea
If I had my way
I'd take a boat from the river
Men go crazy in congregations
One by one

1,Too Much,Spice Girls,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/spice-girls/too-much-chords-456580,"  Love is blind, as far as the eye can see
  Deep and meaningless, words to me
  Easy lover, I need a friend
  Road to nowhere, twist and turns but will this never end.
Well my dear you'll know that he pleases me
But sometimes illusion aint no revolution
That aint no release for me.
Too much of something is bad enough
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied.
  Unwrap yourself from around my finger
  Hold me too tight or left to linger
  Something fine built to last
  Slipped up there I guess were running out of time too fast
Yes my dear you know he soothes me (moves me)
There's no complication, there's no explanation
It's just a groove in me.
Too much of something is bad enough
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied.
What part of no dont you understand, (understand, understand)
I want a man not a boy who thinks he can
Boy who thinks he can.
Too much of something is bad enough
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied.
Too much of nothing so why dont we give it a try
Too much of something were gonna be living a lie.
Too much of nothing so why dont we give it a try

And you hug yourself - on the cold cold ground
You wake the morning - in a stranger's coat
No one would you see
You ask yourself - who'd watch for me
My only friend - who could it be
It's hard to say it     I hate to say it
it's probably me
When you belly's empty - and the hunger's so real
You're too proud to beg - and too dumb to steal
You search the city - for your only friend
No one would you see
You ask yourself, - who'll watch for me
A solitary voice to speak out and set you free
I hate to say it - I hate to say it,
but it's probably me
You're not the easiest person, I ever got to know
And it's hard for us both, and let our feelings show
Some would say, I should let you go your way
You'll only make me cry
Well If there's one guy - just one guy
Who'd   lay     down his   life   for you  and Die
I had to say it - I had to say it
but it's probably me
When the world's gone crazy - and it makes no sense
There's only one voice that comes to your defense
When the jury's out and your eyes search the room
And one friendly face is all you need to see

Who cares whose laws you're governed by
Who cares what name you call a town
Who'll care when you're six feet beneath the ground

A ray of hope, a beam of light
An end to thirty years of night

Under the Arctic fire
Over the seas of silence
Hauling on frozen ropes

All colours bleed to red
Asleep on the ocean's bed
Drifting in empty seas
For all my days remaining

Why should I,
Why should I cry for you?
Dark angels follow me
Over a godless sea
Mountains of endless falling

The stars seem to lose their place

Take me back
So I'll cry with a limp, just get by on a limb
Till these blue eyes of mine they are closed
So here's to an old fashioned peck on the cheek
And farewell my sweet Northern Rose
Give me one last love song
To bring you back, bring you back
Give me one last video
Just dressed in black, dressed in black
Give him a chorus and that bit at the end
Where he wails on and on 'bout the loss of a friend
Let him scream loudly ""well this love could mend""
Let it die, let it die
Those bloody great ballads we hated at first
Well I bought them all, now I'm writing worse
Save us from baldness and saving the earth
Take me back
And I'll smile with a limp, and I'll love with a limp
Till the clouds disappear from above
And as the storm moves away all I can say
Is there's a towel on the door for your love
Give me one last love song
To bring you back, bring you back
Give me one last video
Just dressed in black, dressed in black
Give him a chorus and that bit at the end
Where he wails on and on 'bout the loss of a friend
Let him scream loudly ""well this love could mend""

You told me last night, you were a sun now
With your very own devoted satellite
Happy for you and I am sure that I hate you
Two suns too many, too many able fires, hey yes
You’ve been wasting my time this time
I said you never learned to take
And if I'm hangin' on to your shade
I guess I'm way beyond the pale
I guess I’m way beyond the pale
Had me a trick and a kick and your message
You'll never gain weight from a doughnut hole

I just pacify their egos
I am not my house, my car or my songs
They are only stops along my way
I am like the winter, I'm a dark cold female
With a golden ring of wisdom in my cave
And it's me who is my enemy
Me who beats me up
Me who makes the monsters
Me who strips my confidence
I am carrying my voice
I am carrying my heart
I am carrying my rhythm
I am carrying my prayers
But you can´t kill my spirit, it's old and it is strong
And like a mountain I'll go on and on
But when my wings are folded the brightly colored moth
Blends into the dirt into the ground
And it's me who is my enemy
Me who beats me up
Me who makes the monsters
Me who strips my confidence
And it's me who's too weak
And it's me who's too shy to ask for the thing I love

Claim your right to see the truth.

Will drill a hole in you.

I've seen it coming from the flash of your light.

Wrapped in the warm gentle breeze
So shy, a bundle of butterflies
Flush with heat of desire

The love, the hurt
I've seen you when your dreams were falling in the dust
But I never stopped believing in you
I always thought our love was strong enough
One you could hold on to
You never see it coming
You just let it fly
On silent wings, silent wings
You can't hide what you you feel inside
And the fire has left your eyes
On silent wings
I see us in our dreams and we're dancing
I can almost hear the song
But the prayers, they go unanswered
But we both know, we're just hanging on
I feel ashamed, but I'll never know the reason why
The rug was pulled so gently from under my feet
I only know that something good has died
Between you and me, oh it's just a memory
You never see it coming
You just go separate ways
On silent wings, silent wings
There's no more promises to break
Or our love has slipped away
On silent wings
You never see it coming
But you know it has to end
On silent wings, silent wings
I will never be the same again
I feel the whisper of the wind
On silent wings

The someone you once loved so long ago, so well
Never wonder what I’ll feel as living shuffles by
You don’t have to ask me and I need not reply
Every momentof my life from now until I die
I will think or dream of you and fail to understand
How a perfect love can be confounded out of hand
Is it written in the stars
Are we paying for some crime
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time
Is this God’s experiment
In which we have no say
In which we’re given paradise
But only for a day
Nothing can be altered, oh, there is nothing to decide
No escape, no change of heart, nor any place to hide
You are all I’ll ever want but this I am denyin’
Sometimes in my darkest thoughts I wish I never learned
What it is to be in love and have that love returned

wiens tere poëzie de crisistijd trotseerde naar hoger idealen en menselijkheid op zoek,
toen werd zijn werk geroemd van alle kanten, op zo'n talent had men al jarenlang gewacht.
Hij zag zijn naam opeens gedrukt in alle kranten, ze vonden hem nog beter dan hij zelf ooit had gedacht.
De mandarijnen maakten ruzie in hun blaadjes en iedereen had hem het eerst ontdekt,
hij werd het middelpunt van culturele praatjes en al was hij pas begonnen, de verwachting was gewekt.
Want een wonderkind van twintig is altijd een goed begin.
Ja, die jongen kan wat worden, ja, daar zit nog heel veel in.
Maar van de kunst alleen kan niemand leven, dus het werd een baantje bij een grote krant.
En wat ie verder in zijn leven heeft geschreven, hield met zijn idealen geen verband.
Het was de bezetting die het vuur weer deed ontwaken. Hij wou de ondergrondse in als held.
Hij zou de vijand wel eens goed weten te raken met de bezieling van zijn literair geweld.
Het concentratiekamp kwam hij nog net te boven, maar idealen had hij toen allang niet meer.
En alles waar hij ooit in kon geloven, was verpletterd met de kolf van een geweer.
En een wonderkind van veertig, dat is een naar geval
die zoveel had kunnen worden, maar die niks meer worden zal.
Ja, hij deed nog wel een keertje een vertaling of zoiets, waar geen eer mee kon behaald.
Maar zijn debuut was niet meer vatbaar voor herhaling en naar zijn nieuwe werk werd door geen mens getaald.
Hij heeft nog jaren eenzaam drinkend zitten wachten in een hoekje van de kunstenaarssociëteit, waar de
jongens nauwelijks om zijn grappen lachten, maar een pilsje of een borrel kon hij altijd aan ze kwijt.
Ze hebben hem op zijn kamertje gevonden met een briefje aan zijn kinderen in zijn hand.
En toen pas schreven ze dat ze hem waarderen konden en hij kreeg een stukje in Vrij Nederland.
Want een wonderkind van vijftig voldoet niet aan zijn plicht.
Hij had niet ouder mogen worden, hij heeft de wereld opgelicht, ja.
Want een wonderkind van vijftig voldoet niet aan zijn plicht.
Hij had niet ouder mogen worden, hij heeft de wereld opgelicht.
Ach, een wonderkind van vijftig, dat is immers geen gezicht,
dus om consequent te blijven deed hij zelf het boek maar dicht.

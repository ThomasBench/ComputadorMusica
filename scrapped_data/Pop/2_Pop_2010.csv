0,Despacito,Luis Fonsi,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/luis-fonsi/despacito-chords-1932541,"Si, sabes que ya llevo rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy(DY)
Vi, que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy (oh)
Tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (oh yeah)
Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
Sube sube sube, sube sube...
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos (favorito, favorito baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido
Si te pido un beso, ven dármelo
Yo sé que estás pensándolo
Llevo tiempo intentándolo
Mami esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bom bom
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom bom
Ven prueba de mi boca para ver como te sabe
Quiero quiero, quiero ver cuanto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamos lento, después salvaje
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas, con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia, con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Y es que esa belleza, es un rompecabezas
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza
Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito
Sube, sube, sube, sube, sube
Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos (favorito, favorito baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro
Hasta provocar tus gritos
Y que olvides tu apellido
Despacito
Vamo' hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico
Hasta que las olas griten ‘ay bendito'
Para que mis hechos se queden contigo
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Que le enseñes a mi boca
Tus lugares favoritos (favorito, favorito baby)
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito
Hasta provocar tus gritos (Fonsi)
Y que olvides tu apellido (DY)
Despacito

Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't, nah
I'll be lounging on the couch, just chillin' in my snuggie
Click to MTV so they can teach me how to dougie

Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex

Your wild heart will live for younger days

We were only eleven
But acting like grownups
Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing love is forever and ever
Well, I guess that was true
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
Of an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends
Oops I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
Better hit me, baby, one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
Of the days when we were young
Singing at the top of both our lungs
Now we're under the covers
Fast forward to eighteen
We are more than lovers
Yeah, we are all we need
When we're holding each other
I'm taken back to 2002
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
Of an old Mustang, where we sang
Songs with all our childhood friends

Stand by and we will,
Watch the flames burn auburn on

And if we should die tonight,
We should all die together.
Raise a glass of wine,
For the last time.

Prepare as we will,
Watch the flames burn auburn on

Inside the mountain.
I see fire,
Burning the trees.
And I see fire,
Hollowing souls.
I see fire,
Blood in the breeze.
Oh should my people fall then,
Surely I’ll do the same.
Confined in mountain halls,
We got too close to the flame.

Hold fast and we will,
Watch the flames burn auburn on

Desolation comes upon the sky.

Inside the mountain.

Burning the trees.
And I see fire,
Hollowing souls.
I see fire,
Blood in the breeze.
And if the night is burning,
I will cover my eyes,
For if the dark returns,
Then my brothers will die.
And as the sky is falling down,
It crashed into this lonely town.
And with that shadow upon the ground,
I hear my people screaming out.
And, I see fire,
Inside the mountain.
I see fire,
Burning the trees.
And I see fire,
Hollowing souls.

when I was alone
Nowhere to go
and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the moon
and even sometimes he would go away too
Then one night as I close my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
he came to me
with the sweetest smile
told me he wanted to talk for awhile
He said Peter Pan that's what they call me.
  I promise that you'll never be lonely.
And ever since that day
  I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
  And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
Run, run, lost boy they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to lost boys like me
And lost boys like me are free
He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him, and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day
  I am a lost boy, from Neverland
Usually hangin' out with Peter Pan
  And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

Even Captain Hook, you are my perfect storybook

Forever a lost boy at last
And for always I will say
  I am a lost boy from Neverland
Usually hangin' out with Peter Pan
  And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook

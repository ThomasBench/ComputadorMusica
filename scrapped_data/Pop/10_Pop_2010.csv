You ain't nothing but a troublemaker, girl
You had me hooked again from the minute you sat down
The way you bite your lip got my head spinnin' around
After a drink or two I was putty in your hands
I don't know if I have the strength to stand
Trouble troublemaker, yeah, that's your middle name,
I know you're no good but you're stuck in my brain
And I wanna know
Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad
My mind keeps saying run as fast as you can
I say I'm done but then you pull me back
I swear you're giving me a heart attack, troublemaker
It's like you're always there in the corners of my mind
I see a silhouette every time I close my eyes
There must be poison in those finger tips of yours
Cause I keep comin' back again for more
Trouble troublemaker, yeah, that's your middle name
I know you're no good but you're stuck in my brain, and I wanna know
Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad
My mind keeps saying run as fast as you can
I say I'm done but then you pull me back
I swear you're giving me a heart attack, troublemaker
Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad
My mind keeps saying run as fast as you can, troublemaker
I say I'm done but then you pull me back
I swear you're giving me a heart attack, troublemaker
Maybe I'm insane 'cause I keep doing the same damn thing
Thinking one day we gon' change, but you know just how to work that back
And make me forget my name what the hell you do I won't remember
I'll be gone until November and you'll show up again next summer, yeah!
Typical middle name is Prada Fit you like a glove girl I'm sick of the drama
You're a troublemaker but damn girl it's like I love the trouble
And I can't even explain why
Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad
My mind keeps saying run as fast as you can, troublemaker
I say I'm done but then you pull me back
I swear you're giving me a heart attack, troublemaker
Why does it feel so good but hurt so bad
My mind keeps saying run as fast as you can, troublemaker
I say I'm done but then you pull me back
I swear you're giving me a heart attack, troublemaker

Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love
I did
And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did
And now when all is done
There is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You can go ahead tell them
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible
Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worst
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love is worst
Empty promises will wear
I know (I know)
And know when all is gone
There is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own you can go ahead tell them
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline

Kept on the inside and no sunlight
Sometimes a shadow wins

Say what you wanna say

Bow down to the mighty

Maybe one of these days you can let the light in
Show me how big your brave is

What if he runs the other way and I can't hide from it?
If when he knows me, he's only disappointed?
What if I give myself away, to only get it given back?

somewhere where they don't have girls
He could have masterminded some way to find me
He could be colorblind

He could be less than kind
Or even worse he could be very nice, have lovely eyes
And make me laugh, come out of hiding

Pretends he doesn't know, that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning-e-e-e-ing
And I heard you moved on, from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt, is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see-e-e-e-e

And I realize, the joke is on me,  yeah

I hope to God you're never leaving""

To be right where you are. How old is your soul?
I won't give up on us, even if the skies get rough.

I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make.
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use
the tools and gifts we got, yeah, we got a lot at stake.
And in the end you're still my friend, at least we did intend

Made love for the first time
And you said to me
There's something, something about this place
Something about lonely nights and my lipstick on your face
Something something about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah something about
Baby you and I
Been two years since I let you go,
I could've listened to a joke for rock n roll
And muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart
On my birthday you sang me a heart of gold
With a guitar hummin and no clothes
This time I'm not leavin without you
You said sit back down where you belong
Sit back down on the couch where we
Made love for the first time
And you said to me
There's something, something about this place
Something about lonely nights and my lipstick on your face
Something something about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah something about
Baby you and I
We got a whole lot of money but we still pay rent
'Cause you can't buy a house in heaven
There's only three men that I'mma serve my whole life
It's my daddy and Nebraska and Jesus Christ
There's something, something about the chase (six whole years)
I'm a New York woman born to run you down 
Still want my lipstick all over your face
Somethin', somethin' about just knowing when it's right
So put your drinks up for Nebraska
For Nebraska, Nebraska, I love ya
It's been a long time since I came around
It's been a long time but I'm back in town
But this time I'm not leaving without you

40,Are You Satisfied,MARINA (Marina and The Diamonds),https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/marina-marina-and-the-diamonds/are-you-satisfied-chords-956543,"I was pulling out my hair
The day I cut the deal
Chemically calm
Was I meant to feel happy?
But my life was just about to change
One life pretending to be
The cat who got the cream
Oh, everybody said ""Marina is a dreamer""
People like to tell you what you're gonna be
It's not my problem if you don't see what I see
And I do not give a damn if you don't believe
My problem is my problem:
That I never am happy
It's my problem, it's my problem
Oh, how fast I will succeed
Are you satisfied with an average life?
Do I need to lie to make my way in life?
High achiever don't you see
Baby, nothing comes for free
They say I am a control freak
Driven a greed to succeed
Nobody can stop me
Cause it's my problem
If I want to pack up and run away
It's my business if I feel the need to
Smoke and drink and swear
It's my problem, it's my problem
If I feel the need to hide
And it's my problem if I have no friends
And feel I want to die
Are you satisfied with an average life?
Do I need to lie to make my way in life?
Are you satisfied with an easy ride?
Once you cross the line, will you be satisfied?
Saaad inside ... innnn this life ... Unsatisfied, praying
Saaad inside ... innnn this life ... Unsatisfied, waiting
Are you satisfied with an average life?
Do I need to lie to make my way in life?
Are you satisfied with an easy ride?
Once you cross the line, will you be satisfied?
Are you satisfied?
Are you satisfied?
Are you satisfied?
Are you satisfied?
Are you satisfied?
Are you satisfied?
Are you satisfied?
Are you satisfied?

  Reflections still look the same to me, as before I went under.
  And it's peaceful in the deep, cathedral where you cannot 
  Breathe no need to pray no need to speak, now I am under.
  Oh and it's breaking over me, a thousand miles down to the sea
  Bed, I found a place to rest my head
And the arms of the ocean are carrying me,
And all this devotion was rushing out of me,
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner like me,
But the arms of the ocean delivered me.
  Though the pressure's hard to take, it's the only way I can escape,
  It seems a heavy choice to make, now I am under.

And the crashes are heaven for a sinner like me,
But the arms of the ocean delivered me.
And it's over, and I'm going under,
But I'm not giving up, I'm just giving in,
Whoaaa, slipping underneath,
ooooo, so cold but so sweet.
In the arms, of the ocean, so sweet and so cold,
And all this devotion, I never knew at all,
And the crushes are heaven, for a sinner released,
And the arms of the ocean...
Delivered me..

Mine is a watery pit. Painless with immense distance
From medic from colleague, friend, enemy,

All colours and cares glaze to grey, shrivelled and stricken to dots,
Left hand grasps what the body grasps not oh

Doors open like arms my love, Painless with a great closeness

re-united with his leg and with you, Taro.

0,Forever Now (ver 2),Michael Bublé,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/2525154,"  I just met you
  It seems like yesterday
  You opened up your eyes
And I recognized your face
You know that you're the one that we've been waiting for
We're gonna keep you safe
First time I held you in my arms
I knew I'd love you all the way
   I tuck you in at night
  Another day has passed
Every week goes by a little faster than the last
It wasn't so long ago
We walked together and you held my hand
And now you're getting too big to want to
But I hope you'll always understand
  That I'm always gonna lift you up
  And I'm never gonna let you down
  No matter what you do
I'm forever proud of you
I love you forever now
Through your ears I hear it
  Through your eyes I see
  A world full of magic
Full of possibilities
You know as well as anybody how tough this life can be
But you've got so much strength inside you
A strengh I pray you'll never need
  And I'm always gonna lift you up
  And I'm never gonna let you down
  Time flies by
I hope you realize that I
  Love you forever now
I'm always gonna be right here
I'll always gonna cheer you up
I'm always gonna have your back
You're never gonna be alone
That I'm always gonna lift you up
  And I'm never gonna let you down
  No matter what you do
I'm forever proud of you
I love you forever now
[Outro]
  I love you forever now

1,When I Was Older (ver 2),Billie Eilish,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/billie-eilish/when-i-was-older-chords-2569248,"   When I was older, I was a sailor, on an open sea
   But now I'm underwater, and my skin is paler, than it should ever be
Mmm-hmmm
   I'm on my back again
Dreaming of a time and place where you and I remain the best of friends
Even after all this ends, can we pretend?
   I'm on my, I'm on my back again
It's seeming more and more like all we ever do is see how far it bends
Before it breaks in half and then, we bend it back again
Guess I got caught in the middle of it
Yes I've been taught, got a little of it in my blood, in my blood
Memories burn like a forest fire
Heavy rain turns any funeral pyre to mud, in the flood
   When I was older, I was a sailor, on an open sea
   But now I'm underwater, and my skin is paler, than it should ever be
   I'm watching movies back to back in black and white, I never
   Then going over you, I'm overdue for no endeavors
   You'd really like it in the limelight
   I'm still a victim in my own right
   When I was older, I was a sailor, on an open sea

 Doch alle reden auf dich ein
Und manchmal denkst du, sie werden dich nie verstehen
 Doch sie reden alle Scheiß
Ob du schön bist, zeigt nicht der Zeiger deiner Waage
 Das liest du nicht in Kommentaren
Denn dass du wunderschön bist, kannst du nicht im Spiegel sehen
Denn du bist ein Unikat, einzig in deiner Art
Wir alle ecken an so wie in ei'm Quadrat
Du bist ein Unikat, du bist so wie du bist
Egal, was sie labern, wir geben keinen F**k
Ob du was kannst, siehst du nicht am Kontostand
 Doch alle geben damit an
Mann, lass sie reden, das ist nur Kinderkram
 So wie Likes auf Instagram
Doch du schiebst 'n Film
Und hältst dich darin nur für 'ne Nebenfigur
Aber es ist deine Welt
Und die anderen leben darin nur
Und das, was zählt, ist nicht der Schnitt deiner Haare
 Nicht deine Haut, deine Farbe
Denn dass du wunderschön bist, kannst du nicht im Spiegel sehen
Denn du bist ein Unikat, einzig in deiner Art
Wir alle ecken an so wie in ei'm Quadrat
Du bist ein Unikat, du bist so wie du bist
Egal, was sie labern, wir geben keinen F**k
Dich gibt's nur ein-einmal
Du bist ein Kunstwerk, es steckt in deiner DNA
Dich gibt's nur ein-einmal

hai preso il mio giorno e lo hai reso migliore

tu resta la stessa, la stessa di sempre

  It's a big shame
So many feelings, struggling to leave my mouth
And it's not that rare for me to let myself down
In a big way
    But I had enough time and I found enough reason to accept that
It's not the same anymore
I lost the joy in my face

I should be happy, of course
But things just got much harder
Now it's just hard to ignore

Putting on my best face

I just wanna hit the hay
People knocking on me like every day
I'm tired of taking stress
If only there could be another way
I'm tired of feeling suppressed
And when they want me the most

No point in feeling upset
I'll stand up straight like I'm tall

Then you smiled over your shoulder

I pulled you closer to my chest
and you asked me, to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know

Scared of letting go
I know I needed you
But I'll never show
I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go 
I'll wake you up with some
breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee with a kiss on your head
I'll take the kids to school
wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars, for that night
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

It all just sounds like uh, uh, uh, uh
Too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers and held your hand
Should have gave all my hours when I had the chance
Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby is dancing, but she's dancing with another man.
Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours when he has the chance
Take you to every party cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done when I was your man!
Do all the things I should have done when I was your man!

But something about it felt like home somehow, and I,
Left my scarf there at your sisters house
And you still got it, in your drawer, even now
Oh your sweet dispositon and my wide eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
The autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and, and magics not here no more
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all
Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin size bed
And your mothers telling stories 'bout you on a t-ball team
You tell me about your past thinkin' your future was me
And I know it's long gone and it was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed too
Cause here we are again in the middle of the night
We dance around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well
And maybe we got lost in translation maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
Hey you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lyin' here
Cause I remember it all all all too well
Time won't fly it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You cant get rid of it cause you remember it all too well yeah
Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it oh
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

      He drives a Chevy   Malibu
And when he calls he calls for me and not for you
He lives for love, he loves his drugs, he loves his baby too

And when he calls he calls for me and not for you
He prays for love, he prays for peace and maybe someone new
But I can't help him, can't make him better
And I can't do  nothing about this strange weather
Cause you are unfixable
 I    can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable
You are unfixable

And so is the girl you used to call

Sunsets, small town, I'm out of time
Will you still love me when I shine
From words, but not from beauty?
My father's love was always strong
My mother's glamour  lives on and on
Yet, still inside I felt alone
For reasons unknown to me
But, if you send for me, you know I'll come
And, if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run

And we were young and pretty
The other woman      has time to manicure her nails
The other woman is perfect where her rival fails
And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair, anywhere.
The other woman      enchants her clothes with French perfume
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
There are never toys that's scattered     everywhere
   And when her old man comes to call
   He finds her waiting like a lonesome queen
  'Cause to be by her side
   It's such a change from old routine
But the other woman         will always cry herself to sleep
The other woman will never have his love to keep
And as the years go by the other woman
Will spend her life alone
Alone, alone 
who ho aaah
ah ah whoo hooo ho
Alone
I paint my nails black
I dye my hair a darker shade of brown
Cause you like you like your women Spanish
Dark strong and proud
And paint the sky black
You said if you could have your way
You'd make a night time all today
So it'd suit the mood of your soul

Nothing, my sparrow blue
Oh, what can I do?

I paint the house black
My wedding dress black leather too
You have no room for light
Love is lost on you
I keep my lips red
They seem like cherries in the spring
Darling you can't let everything
Seem so dark blue
And oh, what can I do?
To turn you on, or get through to you?
Oh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful but you don't have a clue

'Cause you were so much better than the rest of them
Out of all the others you were the honest man
He loved guns and roses, guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
He loved guns and roses, roses, roses
Motorcycle love, divine, I should've learned to let you play
We should've left Las Vegas, and then began again
To kill thy king, Detroit, back to the promised land
He loved guns and roses, guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
He loved guns and roses, roses, roses
   I can feel it comin' in the air tonight
   I can see you bathing in the summer light
   You got game, boy, game, boy
   You got game, boy, game, boy
   You got game, boy, game, boy

Roses, roses, roses
White lines, pretty baby, tattoos
Don't know what they mean, they're special, just for you
White palms, baking powder on the stove
Cooking up a dream, turning diamonds into snow
I feel you, pretty baby, feel me
Turn it up hot, loving you is free
I like it down, like it down way low
But you already know that, you already know
Come on down to Florida, I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh ya
Guns in the summertime, drink a Cherry Cola lime
Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my
 Yayo, yayo, yayo
 And all the dope things
 Yayo, yayo, yayo
Zoomin' my miles in gold hoops
You like your little baby like you like your drinks, cool
White lines, pretty daddy, go ski it
You snort it like a champ, like the winter we're not in
Come on down to Florida, I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh ya
Guns in the summertime, drink a Cherry Cola lime
Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my 
 Yayo, yayo, yayo
 And all the dope fiends
 Yayo, yayo, yayo
  We could get high in Miami ooh 
  Dance the night away
  People never die in Miami ooh 
  That's what they all say 
  (You believe me, don't you baby?)
Come on down to Florida, I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh ya
Guns in the summertime, drink a Cherry Cola lime
Prison don't mean nothing to me if you'll be by my 
 Yayo, yayo, yayo
 All the Floridians like
 Yayo, yayo, yayo
 All the Colombians like
 Yayo, yayo, yayo
 And all my girlfriends
 Yayo, yayo, yayo
  That's how we do it, like
  Mmhmm, pretty baby
  White lines, pretty baby
  Gold teeth, pretty baby
  Dance the night away
I've been to Hollywood Hills taking violet pills
Writing all of my songs about my cheap thrills
You're a hard man  to love and I'm
A hard woman to  keep track of
 You like to rage, don't do that
 You want your way, you make me so mad
 Got your gun, I've got my dad
 Is this happiness?
 Is this happiness?
 Is this happiness?
 Is this happiness?
Caught up in Hollywood Hills crushing violet pills
You've been trying to write a novel about your cheap thrills
You think you're Hunter S. Thompson
I think you're fucking crazy as the  day's long
 Man to man, heart to heart
 I love you but you drive me so far
 Wish you well on that star
 Is this happiness?
 Is this happiness?
 Is this happiness?
 Is this happiness?
  Witch Hazel, Witch Hazel
  Betrayal, betrayal
  One gun on the table
  Headshot if you're able
 Is this happiness?
 Is this happiness?
 Is this happiness?
 Is this happiness?
  Are you gonna hurt me now?
  Or are you gonna hurt me later?
  Are you gonna go to town?
  Maybe you should play it safer
  You've got me all dressed up tonight
  You've got me all freaked out tonight
 You don't wanna break me down
 You don't wanna say goodbye and
 You don't wanna turn around
 You don't wanna make me cry but
 You caught me once
 Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again
 You caught me once
 Maybe on the flipside you could catch me again
        Drinks on the patio
  Are you gonna tell me now?
  Are you gonna tell me later?
  Cause if you think that I don't know
  I'm gonna have to say you're crazy
  I'm getting all dressed up tonight
  I already know what you got in store
 You don't wanna break me down
 You don't wanna say goodbye and
 You don't wanna turn around
 You don't wanna make me cry but
 You caught me once
 Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again
 You caught me once
 Maybe on the flipside you could catch me again
So you think you're in charge? Do you?
Actin' like a big shot, I'm sure
So you think you're in charge? Do you?
You're actin' like a big shot
 You don't wanna break me down
 You don't wanna say goodbye and
 You don't wanna turn around
 You don't wanna make me cry but
 You caught me once
 Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again
 You caught me once
 Maybe on the flipside you could catch me again

Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you're the best
I got my red dress on tonight
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Got my hair up real big beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feeling alive
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me any more
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you're the best
I've got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh oh
I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruising down the coast goin' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me any more
Kiss me hard before you go

I just wanted you to know

Later's better than never
Even if you're gone I'm gonna drive, drive

He didn’t like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn’t get this song but I do, I do
Walked in expecting you’d be late
But you got here early
And you stand and wait
I walk to you
You pulled my chair out and helped me in
And you don’t know how nice that is
But I do
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it’s strange that you think I’m funny ‘cause he never did
I’ve been spending the last 8 months thinking all love ever does
Is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again
You said you never met one girl who
Has as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don’t know why I’m coming off a little shy
But I do
But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it’s strange that you think I’m funny ‘cause he never did
I’ve been spending the last 8 months thinking all love ever does
Is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again
And we walk down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about
The movies that your family watches
Every single Christmas
And I won’t talk about that
For the first time, what’s past is past
‘Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it’s strange that you think I’m funny ‘cause he never did
I’ve been spending the last 8 months thinking all love ever does

Would delve where there no more walking on eggshells
Where ideas are for free

Where the canvas is bare
And there's no more despair
And your third eye would stare

And, every whisper, it's the worst, emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now
So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing
It isn't easy for me to let it go
Cause
I've swallowed every single word
And
Every whisper, every sigh
Eats away at this heart of mine
And there is a hollow in me now
So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn
And it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing
And it's not enough
To tell me that you care
When, we both know the words are empty air
You give me nothi-------------ng

       Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
  I think I did it again
I made you believe were more than just friends, oh baby
It might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious
Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oops!...I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby
Oops!...you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
  You see my problem is this
I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes, they truly exist
  I cry, watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways
But to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oops!...i did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby
Oops!...you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
       Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
       Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yes it is
But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end
Well baby, I went down and got it for you
  Oops! I  did it again to your heart
Got lost in this game, oh baby
   Oops!...you think that I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
Oops!...I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby
Oops!...you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent
Oops!...I did it again
I played with your heart, got lost in the game
Oh baby, baby
Oops!...you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

 You keep me without chains.

Than to drown in your love and not feel
your rain.
Set me free, leave me be.

Here I am and I stand so tall, just the way I'm supposed to be.
But you're on to me and all over me.
 You loved me 'cause I'm fragile.
 When I thought that I was strong.

Everything I think I need here on the ground.
 But you're neither friend nor foe though I can't seem to let you go.

You’re keeping me down... ohh, woah...

Was how to shoot somebody who’d out drew ya

  What do you feel when you see the homeless on the street?
  Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep?
  What do you feel when you look in the mirror?
Are you proud?
How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye?
And tell me why
  Dear Mr President, were you a lonely boy
  Were you a lonely boy?
How can you say, no child is left behind
We're not dumb, and we're not blind
They're all sitting in your cells
What kind of father might take his own daughter's rights away?
And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay?
I can only imagine what the first lady has to say
You've come a long way, from whiskey and cocaine
How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye?
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Minimum wage with a baby on the way
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Re-building your house after the bombs took them away
Let me tell you 'bout hard work
Building a bed out of a cardboard box
Let me tell you 'bout hard work, hard work, hard work
You don't know nothing 'bout hard work, hard work
Hard work!

How do you walk, with your head held high

if I tell the world,    I'll never say enough

 And when the rain would fall down
 I'd just stare out my window
 Dreaming of what could be
 And if I'd end up happy
 I would pray 
 Trying hard to reach out
 But when I tried to speak out
 Felt like no one could hear me
 Wanted to belong here
 But something felt so wrong here
 So I'd pray 
 I could break away 
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly.
I'll do what it takes till I touch the sky. 
 Make a wish, take a chance, 
 Make a change, and break away.

 Swinging with revolving doors

Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye

Elles passent en un instant comme fanent les roses. 
On me dit que le temps qui glisse est un salaud 
que de nos chagrins il s'en fait des manteaux pourtant quelqu'un m'a dit
C'est quelqu'un qui m'a dit que tu m'aimais encore. 
Serais ce possible alors
On me dit que le destin se moque bien de nous 
Qu'il ne nous donne rien et qu'il nous promet tout
Parais qu'le bonheur est à portée de main, 
Alors on tend la main et on se retrouve fou
Pourtant quelqu'un m'a dit
Que tu m'aimais encore, 
C'est quelqu'un qui m'a dit que tu m'aimais encore. 
Serais ce possible alors ? 
Mais qui est ce qui m'a dit que toujours tu m'aimais?
Je ne me souviens plus c'était tard dans la nuit, 
J'entend encore la voix, mais je ne vois plus les traits
""Il vous aime, c'est secret, lui dites pas que j'vous l'ai dit""
Tu vois quelqu'un m'a dit... 
Que tu m'aimais encore, me l'a t'on vraiment dit... 
Que tu m'aimais encore, serais ce possible alors ?

I got my angel now

I ain't never gonna shut you out

You know you're my saving grace 
You're everything I need and more

Burning through my darkest night

Gravity can't forget 
To pull me to the ground again

All rejoicing in the world

We can try
We lived an adventure
Love in the Summer
Followed the sun till night
Reminiscing other times of life
The feeling was stronger
The shock hit eleven
Got lost in your eyes

Are you gonna leave me now
Can’t you be believing now
Can you remember and humanize,
It was still where we’d energized,
Lie in the sand and visualize like its 75 again

To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet that's my stuff - Yes
If I bought it  please don't touch (don't touch)
And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time and
It's my mine name that is on that Jag
So remove your bags let me call you a cab
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I'm such a fool - Talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute - baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet ya thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
Cause you was untrue 
Rolling her around in the car that I bought youOO
Baby drop them keys hurry up before your taxi leaves
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I'm such a fool - Talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you in a minute

You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I will have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking..... 
You're irreplaceable (irreplacable)
So since I'm not your everything
How about I'll be nothing, nothing at all to you (nothing)
Baby I wont shed a tear for you (I wont shed a tear for you)
I won't lose a wink of sleep (a wink of sleep)

Searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that one
Really loves my company
He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
But clouds are rollin' in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy
With some other guy
   I don't wanna do this anymore
   I don't wanna be the reason why
Everytime I walk out the door
 I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
   I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be...
A murderer
I feel it in the air
As I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Accepts i'm gonna be out late
I say I won't belong
Just hangin' with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well

And it kills him inside

Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!""
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever want to be king?
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
(Ohhhhh Ohhh Ohhh)

hemmafester och en stulen bil

Snurra flaskan
jag har aldrig

vad vill du veta om mig
fråga bara
jag berättar vad som helst
Det var 17 år
17 år i staden där jag växte upp och så
märker du hur fort det går
och jag var 17 år ville inte va den
som blev kvar
Jag har slitit ut så många skor
i en stad där ingen längre bor
hjälpte till på min brorsas restaurang
mina vänner ville va som han
Valborgskaos på stora torget
rackaberget ’95
vi bodde högst upp

en vattenfestival
minns att ingen ville åka hem
jag skulle utomlands
jag bytte efternamn
och jag blev en av dom som aldrig kommit hem

Once or twice was enough And it was all in vain
Time starts to pass Before you know it you’re frozen
But something happened For the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground Found something true
And everyone’s looking round Thinking I’m going crazy
But I don’t care what they say I’m in love with you
They try to pull me away But they don’t know the truth
My heart’s crippled by the vein That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open
Keep bleeding Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open
And it’s draining all of me 
Oh they find it hard to believe 
I’ll be wearing these scars 
For everyone to see 
I don’t care what they say

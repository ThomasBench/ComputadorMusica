1,You Are Not Alone,Michael Jackson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/michael-jackson/you-are-not-alone-chords-657042,"Another day has gone, I'm still all alone,
How could this be? You're not here with me.
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why,
Did you have to go, and leave my world so cold?
Everyday I sit and ask myself : How did love slip away ?
Something whispers in my ear and says that...
You are not alone, for I am here with you.
Though you're far away, I am here to stay.
But you are not alone, for I am here with you,
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart,
But you are not alone.
No...
'Lone, why?
'Lone...
Just the other night I thought I heard you cry,
Asking me to come, and hold you in my arms.
I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear,
But first I need your hand, then forever can begin.
Everyday I sit and ask myself : How did love slip away ?
Something whispers in my ear and says that...
You are not alone, for I am here with you.
Though you're far away, I am here to stay.
But you are not alone, for I am here with you,
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart,
You are not alone, for I am here with you.
Though you're far away, I am here to stay.
But you are not alone, for I am here with you,
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart,
But you are not alone.

 How can life be what you want it to be

 You waste your tme with hate and regret
You're broken, when your heart's not open

 Let all the hurt inside of you die

hard to find your dreams
Without someone to share it with

With satelite television

 And if you jump you just might fall
And if you shout I'll only hear you

And I know that it is love
And this place could be much
Brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel
There's no hurt or sorrow
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong it only cares for joyful giving
If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear or dread we stop existing
And start living
Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
Make a better world
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
And the dream we were conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth crucify this soul
Though it's plain to see
Be God's glow
We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords
Into plowshares
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place

It requires a dedication.

Everything is nothing when you got no one
And you did walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing.
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the messages is clear
This could be the year of the real thing.
No more will you cry baby I will hurt you never.

Se non ci sei tu con me, con me
Su le finestre
Mostra a tutti il mio cuore Che hai accesso
Chiudi dentro me 
La luce Che, hai incontrato per strada.
Con te partiro
Paesi che non ho mai
Veduto e vissuto con te
Adesso si li vivre
Con te partiro
Su navi per mari Che io lo so
No no non esistono piu
Con te io li rivivro.
Quando sei lontana Sogno allorizzonte E mancan le parole
E io si lo so Che sei con me con me
Tu mia luna tu sei qui con me
Mio sole tu sei qui con me, Con me, con me, con me.

La brume viendra dans sa robe blanche
Y'aura des feuilles partout
Couchées sur les cailloux
Octobre tiendra sa revanche
Le soleil sortira à peine
Nos corps se cacheront sous des bouts de laine
Perdue dans tes foulards
Tu croiseras le soir
Octobre endormi aux fontaines
Il y aura certainement,
Sur les tables en fer blanc
Quelques vases vides et qui traînent
Et des nuages pris aux antennes
Je t'offrirai des fleurs
Et des nappes en couleurs
Pour ne pas qu'Octobre nous prenne
On ira tout en haut des collines
Regarder tout ce qu'Octobre illumine
Mes mains sur tes cheveux
Des écharpes pour deux
Devant le monde qui s'incline
Certainement appuyés sur des bancs
Il y aura quelques hommes qui se souviennent
Et des nuages pris sur les antennes
Je t'offrirai des fleurs
Et des nappes en couleurs
Pour ne pas qu'Octobre nous prenne
Et sans doute on verra apparaître
Quelques dessins sur la buée des fenêtres
Vous, vous jouerez dehors
Comme les enfants du nord
Octobre restera peut-être.
Vous, vous jouerez dehors

and i wish on a star that somewhere you are
thinking of me too

til to-morrow i'll be holding you tight
and there's nowhere in the world i'd rather be
than here in my room, dreaming a-bout you and me
Wonder if you even see..... me
And I wonder if you know I'm there
If you looked in my eyes Would you see what's inside?
Would you even care?
now i'm dream-ing of you to-night

and there's nowhere in the world i'd rather be......

    You've been the sweetest part of my life so long

   For the fire and the faith that was you and me

e mancan le parole,
si lo so che non c'è luce
in una stanza quando manca il sole,
se non ci sei tu con me, con me.
Su le finestre
mostra a tutti il mio cuore
che hai accesso,
chiudi dentro me
la luce che
hai incontrato per strada.
Time to say goodbye. 
Paesi che non ho mai 
veduto e vissuto con te,
adesso sì li vivrò.
Con te partirò su navi per mari
che, io lo so, no, no, non esistono più
it's time to say goodbye. 
Quando sei lontana sogno all'orizzonte
e mancan le parole,
e io si lo so
che sei con me, con me,
tu mia luna tu sei qui con me,
mio sole tu sei qui con me,
con me, con me, con me.
Time to say goodbye. 
Paesi che non ho mai
veduto e vissuto con te,
adesso sì li vivrò.
Con te partirò su navi per mari
che, io lo so, no, no, non esistono più
con te io li rivivrò.

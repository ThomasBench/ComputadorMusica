Can't stop staring at those ocean eyes
Burning cities and napalm skies
Fifteen flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes
No fair
You really know how to make me cry
When you give me those ocean eyes
I'm scared
I've never fallen from quite this high
Falling into your ocean eyes
Those ocean eyes
Yeah, yeah-eah-eah
I ain't really trippin' if you wanna go
I know I made you cry last year when I was on the road
I meant it when I said it, you can always hit my phone

I'ma make this fetty, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I never would forget you, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Look me in my eyes, tell me you ain't a part of me, no fair
No fair (yeah, yeah-eah-eah)

I must be missing something
They just keep doing nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Better off without them
They're nothing but unstable
Bring ashtrays to the table
And that's about the only thing they share
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever
Wakin' up at sundown (Ooh)
They're late to every party (Ooh)
Nobody's ever sorry (Ooh)
Too inebriated now to dance
Morning as they come down (Come down)
Their pretty heads are hurting (Hurting)
They're awfully bad at learning (Learning)
Make the same mistakes, blame circumstance
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better

Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever

On your cigarette break
I can't afford to love someone

And your mother's favorite song

Sorry that I can't believe that anybody ever really
Starts to fall in love with me
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry I could be so blind
Didn't mean to leave you
And all of the things that we had behind
  Ooh   ooh   ooh
I run away when things are good
And never really understood
The way you laid your eyes on me
In ways that no one ever could
And so it seems I broke your heart
My ignorance has struck again
I failed to see it from the start
And tore you open 'til the end
And I'm sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry that I can't believe that anybody ever really
Starts to fall in love with me
Sorry to my unknown lover
Sorry I could be so blind
Didn't mean to leave you

And if there's love in this life, there's no obstacle
That can't be defeated
For every tyrant a  tear, for the vulnerable
In every lost soul, the bones of the miracle
For every dreamer, a dream we're unstoppable
With something to believe in
Monday left me broken
Tuesday I was through with hoping
Wednesday my empty arms were open
Thursday waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love
To come around
We are one of a kind irreplaceable
How did I get so blind and so cynical
If theres love in this life we´re unstoppable
No we can´t be defeated

Wednesday my empty arms were open

Do you hang on every, word, I, say
Lose yourself in time,
At the mention of my name.
Will I ever know
How it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me
Whichever road I choose you'll go?

You know I give a fuck about you everyday
Guess it's time that I tell you the truth
If I share my toys, will you let me stay?

  But always hit the floor
I've spent a lifetime running
And I always get away
But with you I'm feeling something
That makes me want to stay
  I'm prepared for this
  I never shoot to miss
But I feel like a storm is coming
If I'm gonna make it through the day
Then there's no more use in running
This is something I gotta face
  If  I   risk it all
  Could you  break my fall?
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here I'm suffocating
I want to feel love, run through my blood
Tell me is this where I give it all up?
For you I have to risk it a-all
Cause the writing's on the wall
  A million shards of glass
  That haunt me from my past
As the stars begin to gather
And the light begins to fade
When all hope begins to shatter
Know that I won't be afraid
  If I    risk it all
  Could you  break my fall?
How do I live? How do I breathe?

And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying, oh my oh, well no I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'

Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
For all the times you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

Cause if you like the way you look that much

Denn du bist online, doch Du schreibst nicht und ich schlage auf den Schreibtisch.
Frag mich, ob du grad allein bist, oder fühlst du grad das gleiche?
Ich will nur dass du weißt, wie oft ich Briefe an dich schreib.
Und sie wieder zerreiß, und dass ich Dich liebe und so'n Scheiß.
Ich will nur dass du weißt, wie oft ich Lieder für dich schreib,
und sie niemandem zeig, weil ich will dass niemand davon weiß.
Und ich schreib SMS, doch ich schick sie nicht weg, ob du online bist hab ich so oft gechecked.
Und ich war an deiner Tür, nur geklopft hab ich nicht, ich wollte nur sehen ob da wer bei dir ist.
   Alle meine Freunde raten, dich mir aus dem Kopf zu schlagen,
die wissen gar nicht was sie sagen, dich zu vergessen dauert Jahre.
Und ich geh kaum noch auf die Straße, denn ich seh überall nur Paare.
Und trägt ne andre' deinen Namen, ja dann raubts mir fast den Atem.
Jedesmal wenn eine Frau dein Parfüm an sich trägt, bilde ich mir einen Moment ein, 
dass du mir direkt gegenüber stehst.
Ich will nur dass du weißt, wie oft ich Briefe an dich schreib.
Und sie wieder zerreiß, und dass ich Dich liebe und so'n Scheiß.

Thought I found a way out (Found)
But you never go away (Never go away)
So I guess I gotta stay now
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
Isn't it lovely, all alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
Walking out of town
Looking for a better place (Looking for a better place)
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space
But I know someday I'll make it out of here

Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end
Always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened
And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger
And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records
And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
And I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
But you didn't have to cut me off

I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So keep dancing, come on
I can't stop the, 
I can't stop the
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
(I can't stop the feeling)
Got this feeling in my body
(I can't stop the feeling)
Got this feeling in my body
(I can't stop the feeling)
Wanna see you move your body
(I can't stop the feeling)
Got this feeling in my body

En enfer mon ange
J’ai prévu nos adieux
À la terre mon ange
Et je veux partir avec  toi
Je veux mourir dans tes  bras
Que la mer nous mange le  corps, ah
Que le sel nous lave le  cœur, ah
Je t’aimerai encore
Je t’aimerai encore
Je t’aimerai encore
Je t’aimerai encore
Je m’excuse auprès des dieux
De ma mère et ses louanges
Je sais toutes les prières
Tous les vœux
Pour que ça change
Mais je veux partir avec  toi
Je veux mourir dans tes  bras
Que la mer nous mange le  corps, ah
Que le sel nous lave le  cœur, ah
Je t’aimerai encore
Je t’aimerai encore
Je t’aimerai encore
Je t’aimerai encore
On brûlera toutes les deux
En enfer mon ange
Tu peux écrire tes adieux
À la terre mon ange
Car je veux partir avec  toi
Je veux mourir dans tes  bras
Si la mer nous mange le  corps, ah
Si le sel nous pique le  cœur, ooh
Je t’aimerai encore
Je t’aimerai encore
Je t’aimerai encore
Je t’aimerai encore

    I'm not one of those who can    easily hide
    I don't have much money    but, boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where    we both could live
    So excuse me forgetting    but, these things I do
    You see I've forgotten if    they're green or they're blue
    Anyway the thing is    what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes    I've ever seen
    And you can tell everybody    this is your song
    It may be quite simple but    now that it's done
    I hope you don't mind
    I hope you don't mind    that I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the world
    If I was a sculptor,    but then again no
    Or a girl who makes potions in    a traveling show
    I know it's not much but    it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and    this one's for you
    And you can tell everybody    this is your song
    It may be quite simple but    now that it's done
    I hope you don't mind
    I hope you don't mind    that I put down in words
How wonderful life is now you're in the world

49,Dark Paradise,Lana Del Rey,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lana-del-rey/dark-paradise-chords-1128935,"All my friends tell me I should move on
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song
Ahhh, that's how you sang it
Loving you forever, can't be wrong
Even though you're not here, won't move on
Ahhh, that's how we played it
And there's no remedy for memory your face is
Like a melody, it won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me and telling me
But I wish I was dead
Every time I close my eyes                              
It's like a dark paradise                               
No one compares to you                                  
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side 
Every time I close my eyes                              
It's like a dark paradise                               
No one compares to you                                  
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side 
All my friends ask me why I stay strong
Tell 'em when you find true love it lives on
Ahhh, that's why I stay here
And there's no remedy for memory your face is
Like a melody, it won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me and telling me
But I wish I was dead
Every time I close my eyes

I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side  
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight
Oh oh oh oh, ha ha ha ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh oh oh oh, ha ha ha ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
There's no relief, I see you in my sleep
And everybody's rushing me, but I can feel you touching me
There's no release, I feel you in my dreams
Telling me I'm fine
Every time I close my eyes                              
It's like a dark paradise

You’re gonna love the clientele
The cheap rent and the climates’ swell
Annabelle I’ve been drunk since half past twelve
Don’t bring me down
Don’t bring me down
The world it seems to be ending constantly
Between the smoking, drinking and getting high
I’d shed a tear if I could find the time
Ah, Ah, Ah
God can’t save us
Ah, Ah, Ah
So let’s live like sinners
Commiserations to your mum and your dad
My reassurances it’s not that bad
Ah, Ah, Ah
You’ve got to live a little
When their world just wants you sad
Annabelle where the forbidden dwell
Come lay me down
Come lay me down
The world it seems to be ending constantly
Between the smoking, drinking and getting high
I’d shed a tear if I could find the time
Ah, Ah, Ah
God can’t save us
Ah, Ah, Ah
So let’s live like sinners
Commiserations to your mum and your dad
My reassurances it’s not that bad
Ah, Ah, Ah
You’ve got to live a little
When their world just wants you sad
The heavens are open
The angels descending
God bless you, undress you and this unhappy ending.
The underworld kids of the choir will sing
“Hallelujah! God has left the building”
Ah, Ah, Ah
God can’t save us
Ah, Ah, Ah
So let’s live like sinners
Commiserations to your mum and your dad
My reassurances it’s not that bad
Ah, Ah, Ah
You’ve got to live a little
When their world just wants you sad

Or is this just how we're livin now?
Refuse-to-wake cause I have-never-been this close
You always think I'm leavin'
Before I've had the chance to stay
Darling-it'll-be ok
If-you-look-me in the eyes
Just look me in the eyes I sing now
Don't be afraid of the fire babe
I'd-never-let-you burn
All these bridges we cross all have water underneath
When-the-ashes of lost love make it hard to breathe
My love if we burn would-you-burn right next to me?
And-I-can-still hear you breathin'
Like-each-and-every-time you say my name
All the clouds and all the rain, paint-a-picture of my day
There's so much revealed when
You-take-the-time-to-know-me-for who I am
Darling, just who I am
Don't be afraid of the fire babe
I'd-never-let-you burn
All these bridges we cross all have water underneath
When-the-ashes-of lost love make it hard to breathe
My love if we burn would-you-burn right next to me?
I-was-in-the-dark the day that I met you
Now-you-expect-me just to forget you-
Act-like-the fire never burned it was my solstice my refuge
Sittin'-on-the-sun I was so nervous to let you
Share-with-me-this-pain the-reason I don't take a day off
My-intentions-they-were-pure I'm just a beacon for chaos
If that fire ever burned just let it burn
I said if that fire ever burned just let it burn
Don't be afraid of the fire babe
I'd-never-let you burn
All these bridges we cross all have water underneath
When-the-ashes-of lost love make it hard to breathe
My love if we burn would-you-burn right next to me?
And is it safe to say....... you are
And is it safe to say....... you are
Oh babe, you're-the-flame the-fire but most of all you're the spark

2,Enough For Now,Ethan Gruska,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ethan-gruska/enough-for-now-chords-2970527,"In another light
I'm stuck to another life
Skip over to the other line
Way upfront
In another car
Maybe livin' on another shore
Somethin' different that I'm livin' for
Or someone
Cover to cover
Never satisfied
I'm going under
I wanna go home, won't never look back
Maybe I'll try
Maybe I'll die trying
To let this be enough
For now, for now enough
Maybe I'll try
Maybe I'll die trying
To let this be enough
For now
I won't wish for better luck
I'm over everyone
I stay home, stay on the run
I go blind when the visions come
I'm kept under
And there's no other life
There's no living in another lie
There's nothing special about you and I
We're on our own like everyone else
Maybe I'll try
Maybe I'll die trying
To let this be enough
For now, for now enough
Maybe I'll try
Maybe I'll die trying
To let this be enough
For now
I won't wish for better luck
When you lay your head down, you are home
How does everyone else do that?
The grass is dead on the other side
I'll get to it but I suspect that everything I have
Is what I've been dreaming of, so
Maybe I'll try
Maybe I'll die trying
To let this be enough
For now, for now enough
Maybe I'll try
Maybe I'll die trying
To let this be enough
For now
I won't wish for better luck

To let this be enough

Haven't met somebody new in what feels like forever
I'm happy we stayed out all night dancing
  Oh, what a rush as you held me close, spinning slow
  We drank too much, let our bodies touch on the way back home
And I got this feeling, after you leave in the morning
I'll still be drunk on you, still be drunk on you
 Drunk on you, drunk on you
Baby, I'll still be drunk on you
Drunk on you, drunk on you
Baby, I'll still be drunk on you
We were sitting curbside, late night, city views
Sipping on some cheap wine and staring at the moon
Haven't felt a spark in what feels like forever and ever
Happy we stayed out all night dancing
  Oh, what a rush as you held me close, spinning slow
  We drank too much, let our bodies touch on the way back home
And I got this feeling, after you leave in the morning
I'll still be drunk on you, still be drunk on you
Drunk on you, drunk on you
Baby, I'll still be drunk on you (Baby, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be drunk)
Drunk on you, drunk on you (Baby, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be drunk on you, drunk on you)
Baby, I'll still be drunk on you
It doesn't feel like I just met you
It's like I know you, but I hold my feelings back
Because I just met you
And I don't wanna get ahead of myself, no
It doesn't feel like I just met you
It's like I know you, but I hold my feelings back
     I don't wanna get ahead of myself, oh
     But look at me get ahead of myself, oh
  Oh, what a rush as you held me close, spinning slow
  We drank too much, let our bodies touch on the way back home
And I got this feeling, after you leave in the morning
I'll still be drunk on you, still be drunk on you
(Baby, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be drunk)
(Baby, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be drunk on you, drunk on you)
(Baby, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be drunk)
(Baby, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be drunk on you, drunk on you)
 I got this feeling, after you leave in the morning
I'll still be drunk on you, still be drunk on you
Drunk on you, drunk on you

Farci sgridare da qualcuno
Ah, che noia essere grandi
Andare ai compleanni e parlare
Di soldi, dei figli degli altri
Ah, è tardi e devo già andare
E mi manca aspettare l’estate
Comprare le caramelle colorate
E mi manca la strada in due in bici
Mi manco io, mi manchi tu
E mi manca una bella canzone
Pagare qualcosa con le figurine
E mi manca la biro tra i denti
Mi manco io, mi manchi tu
 Ti  manco io e ti manchi tu?
Avevo voglia di parlare con te
Te lo ricordi il tuo primo pallone
Finiva sotto le macchine
Però col vento sapeva volare
Non sai che voglia di giocare che ho
Anche di piangere e soffiarmi il naso
Poi sprofondare nell’erba più alta
Tornare a casa sporco di prato
Ah, invece siamo già grandi
Con il dovere di dare risposte
Firmare e non lanciare sassi
Oh ah, ti voglio ancora bene

From the taste of true love's lips
There is more to me than potion
Like a poison running thick and
Nothing ever was a story
Only guaranteed to end
And the more I push the more he
Push back and we start again

Back up around the bend
And I see the rope's untying
And the bridge comes caving in and

When the breaking went to bend
When you got your tables turning
When you take my heart again

Lassies mourn and seamen flow
Rowing with one hand hey ho
Six weeks dry without consent
They all said no so off I went
Left the ship and aimed at shore
a sturdy grip around the oar.
Yo ho, hey ho - hey all hands in a row
Man the pumps down below
Yo hey ho - now we row
Rowing in a rowing boat
A trail behind me left afloat
I’ll raise the level of the sea
Enjoying my own company
One oar on the deck I stow
Frees next hand to go below
I ain't going straight to port
Of fantasies I’m never short
Yo ho, hey ho - hey all hands in a row
Man the pumps down below
Yo hey ho - now we row
Some like rowing two and two
Or pass the ore along the crew
Others row in solitude
All dressed up or in the nude
Some go left, and some go right
In circles rowing day and night.
Takes a while to get me there
But timewise I'm a millionaire
My starboard arm as strong and grand
As nimble be my pistol hand.
Greasy oil from sperm whale spleen
Keeps my leather nice and lean
Rowing with one hand hey ho
Round and round and round I go

Rowing with one hand hey ho

45,You And Your Friends,Peach Pit,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/peach-pit/you-and-your-friends-chords-3067274,"Anytime you call me up past one it’s not my favourite way,
To get at the feeling.
I’ve gotten awful lots since tenth grade,
Had you locked and leaving.
If this could wrap around and through ya.
I’ll be at the spot up river, thought you’d be there anyway.
Where’d you think we’re meeting.
Come on let me hear it,
Everyone’s a villain baby save for you and your friends.
I’ll be in division, she’s freezing in the kitchen.
Won’t you let me be the best one that you know,
But you won’t.
Anytime you call me up past one it’s not a bother kid,
Later we’ll be laughing.
Had ya been sitting in my thought again
I’d have seen you passing.
If this could wrap around and through ya.
I’ll be at the spot up river, thought you be there anyway.
Where’d you think we’re meeting.
Come on let me hear it,
Everyone’s a villain baby save for you and your friends.
I’ll be in division, she’s freezing in the kitchen.
Won’t you let me be the best one that you know,
But you won’t.
Come on let me hear it,
Everyone’s a villain baby save for you and your friends.
I’ll be in division, she’s freezing in the kitchen.
Won’t you let me be the best one that you know.

46,Live At The Swamp,Peach Pit,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/peach-pit/live-at-the-swamp-chords-3070886,"Come to see that you could be just my type
Dumping your guts on the lawn as we're live at the swamp
Natalie's in psychedelic sideswipe
She's had a couple and coming up tears in her bloom
Charlie's off it too
Holding you is bettering me
And I know you won't say it
Wheeling out over the week
And I'd be down to waste it
Come to see that you and me have timed right
Hit by the blotter as I rip the water in two
Now you've got me folded up in hindsight
As if a day would go by without thinking of you
And ones not in view
Holding you is bettering me
And I know you won't say it
Wheeling out over the week
And I'd be down to waste it
Holding you is bettering me
And I know you won't say it
Wheeling out over the week
And I'd be down to waste it

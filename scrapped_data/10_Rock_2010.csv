    i want to remember, i think it was about noon
   it's getting harder to understand, to understand
   how you felt in my hands, in my hands
i could be a pretty girl, i'll wear a skirt for you
i could be a pretty girl, shut up when you want me to
i could be a pretty girl, won't ever make you blue
i could be a pretty girl, i'll lose myself in you
i was so blinded by you, now i cry
just thinking 'bout the fool that i was
I WAS SUCH A FOOL!
i'm alone now but it's better for me
i don't need all your negativity
i could be a pretty girl, i'll wear a skirt for you
i could be a pretty girl, shut up when you want me to
i could be a pretty girl, won't ever make you blue
i could be a pretty girl, i'll lose myself in you

I'm smiling for you
I'd do anything
For you, for you
It's always for you
And never for me
and I need it to stop
So let me tell you, please
I'm always sad
And I'm always lonely
But I can't tell you
That I'm breaking slowly
Closed doors
Locked in, no keys
Keeping my feelings hidden
There is no ease
I need it to stop
And I want to be able
To open up but,
My feelings are fatal
  (My feelings are fatal)
   How many times
Must I keep it inside
I need to let go
And I swear that I've tried
But opening up
Means trusting others
And that's just too much,
I don't want to bother
So I'll keep it inside
And I'll bury it deep
I know it's not healthy
But you won't hear a peep
Though I'm always sad
And I'm always lonely
I could never tell you
That I'm breaking slowly
Closed doors
Locked in, no keys
Keeping my feelings hidden
There is no ease
I need it to stop
And I want to be able
To open up but,
My feelings are fatal
Oh oh oh ho ohh
My feelings are fatal
Oh ho oh oh oh ho oh oh oh ohh

The thirsty without price
We'll take a cup of kindness yet

Callin' me out when I'm wounded

Your wild fire lies and your humiliation

Washed up and ranting about the 
Same old   bitter   things
Drunk and grumblin' all about how I  can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean...and a liar...and pathetic
And alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

 Not nearly as loud as a voice singing
 Let it happen, let it happen (It's gonna feel so good)
 Just let it happen, let it happen
 All this running around
 Trying to cover my shadow
 An ocean growing inside
 Now all the others seem shallow
 All this running around
 Bearing down on my shoulders
 I can hear an alarm
 Must be morning
 I heard about a whirlwind that's coming around
 It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound, and
 When it happens, when it happens (I'll be holding on)
 So let it happen, let it happen
 All this running around
 I can't fight it much longer
 Something's trying to get out
 And it's never been closer
 If my ticker fails
 Make up some other story
 But if I never come back
 Tell my mother I'm sorry
 And it means, we move on ice giving
Trying to get dreaming
Trying to pose living
You knew I'm not thinking that I would let you in
Any other silver
And I would just do it
Get the meshed thinking
Get the meshed dreaming
Why would I do it
Anyone'd think that 
I could not do it, we move on ice giving
Trying to get dreaming
Trying to pose living
You knew I'm not thinking that I would let you in
Any other silver
And I would just do it
Get the meshed thinking
Get the meshed dreaming
Why would I do it
Anyone'd think that 
 I will not vanish and you will not scare me
Try to get through it
try to bounce to it
All the while thinking I might as well do it
They be lovin' someone
and I'm not that stupid
Get the meshed thinking
Take the next ticket to take the next train
Why would I do it?
And you wanna think that 
Maybe, I was ready
All along
Oh maybe, I was ready
All along
Oh maybe, I was ready     |

Running from my own life now

Looking up to the sky for something I may never find
Stop calling
It's time to let me be
If you think you can save me
I'd dare you to try
Lift the heart from the depths it's fallen to
We all want something new
But can't seem to follow through
Something's better than nothing
Or so that I thought
Now I know it's just one dream
All these others gonna tear me apart
Love is calling
It's time to let it through
Find a love that will make you
I dare you try
Crazy guy
I think this is deep
Think it's meant to be
More than anything I can think of
I'm ready to try
Treat me right
I'm still a good man's daughter
Let me in if I break
And be quiet if I shatter
Getting tired of looking
You know that I hate the game
Don't wanna waste any more time
You know I been holding out
Love is calling
It's time to give to you
Something you can hold onto
I dare you try

Driven a greed to succeed

Smoke and drink and swear
It's my problem, it's my problem

as if I needed a reminder
oh, I do only what I wanna

3:10   pm, Capa pends death, quivers, last rattles, last chokes
All colours and cares glaze to grey, shrivelled and stricken to dots,
Left hand grasps what the body grasps not oh 
   le photographe est mort.
 3.1415, alive no longer my amour, faded for home May of '54
Doors open like arms my love, Painless with a great closeness
To Capa, to Capa Capa dark after nothing,
re-united with his leg and with you, Taro.
Do not spray into eyes – I have sprayed you into my eyes.

Good turned to bad and bad turned to misery
I found out what it is and what it's not
And all I ask for sure ain't what I got,no
Well I've been rained on, rode hard and put up wet
Danced with the devil 'til I'm in debt
Took all I got and there ain't much left of me
I've been knocked down, drug out and left for dead
Barely held together by a few old threads
And I'm still here there ain't much left to see,no
Well I'm still holding on and there ain't much left of me
Thought that I hit bottom but I ain't there yet
'Cause you'd be surprised of how low a man can get
I watched stolen dreams slip through my hands
And now I'm getting out of here while I still can... ohh...
Well I've been rained on, rode hard and put up wet
Danced with the devil 'til I'm in debt
Took all I got and there ain't much left of me
I've been knocked down, drug out and left for dead
Barely held together by a few old threads
And I'm still here there ain't much left to see,no
Well I'm still holding on and there ain't much left of me

Well my fall from grace was a sight to see
Nobody even cared what became of me
Do I have to get down on my knees
And ask the Lord ,Lord have mercy on me
Well I've been rained on, rode hard and put up wet
Danced with the devil 'til I'm in debt
Took all I got and there ain't much left of me

Haben nie die Neugier verlor'n

Wir haben gelacht und geweint
Wir haben Frieden geschlossen

Doch alle diese Dinge sind so klein
Denn das Größte was wir können ist Mensch zu sein
Und wir gehen den Weg von hier

Denn wir gehen den Weg von hier
Weiter und weiter ein Leben lang, für immer

Die wir vorher nicht kannten
Wir haben Sprechen gelernt 
Und uns Liebe gestanden
Wir haben Lieder geschrieben
Wir haben getanzt und gesungen
Wir haben Geister gerufen
Und Dämonen bezwungen
Es ist nicht immer einfach zu verzeihen
Doch das Größte was wir können ist Mensch zu sein
Und wir gehen den Weg von hier

Doch wer will das schon sein
Wir haben alle kleine Fehler

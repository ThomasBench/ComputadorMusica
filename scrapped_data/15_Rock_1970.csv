0,Levon,Elton John,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/elton-john/levon-chords-481453,"Levon wears his war wound like a crown.
He calls his child Jesus
`Cause he likes the name
And he sends him to the finest school in town
And Levon, Levon likes his money
He makes a lot they say
Spend his days counting
In a garage by the motorway
He was born a pauper to a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times said God is dead and the war's begun
Alvin Tostig has a son today
And he shall be Levon and he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon in tradition with the family plan
And he shall be Levon and he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon
Levon sells cartoon balloons in town
His family business thrives
Jesus blows up balloons all day
Sits on the porch swing watching them fly
And Jesus, he wants to go to Venus
Leaving Levon far behind
Take a balloon and go sailing
While Levon, Levon slowly dies
He was born a pauper to a pawn on a Christmas day
When the New York Times said God is dead and the war's begun
Alvin Tostig has a son today
And he shall be Levon and he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon in tradition with the family plan
And he shall be Levon and he shall be a good man
He shall be Levon

 Paddles cut the water
 In a long and hurried flight
 From the white man  to the fields of green
 and the homeland  we've never seen
 They killed us in our teepees
 They might have left some babies
 Cryin' on the ground
 But the firesticks  and the wagons come
 And the night falls  on the settin' sun
 They massacred the buffalo
 The taxis run across my feet
 And my eyes have turned to blanks
 In my little box  at the top of the stairs
 With my indian rug  and a pipe to share
 I wish I was a trapper
 To sleep with Pocahontas
 and find out how she felt
 In the mornin' on the fields of green
 In the homeland  we've never seen
 And maybe Marlon Brando
 We'll sit and talk of Hollywood
 And the good things there for hire
 And the Astrodome  and the first teepee
 Marlon Brando,  Pocahontas and me

Tell you what I'd do
I'd throw away the cars and the bars and the wars
And make sweet love to you

         There were plants and birds and rocks and things,
         There was sand and hills and rings.
         The first thing i met was a fly with a buzz
         And the sky with no clouds.
         The heat was hot and the ground was dry,
         But the air was full of sound.
         I've been through the desert on a horse with no name,
         It felt good to be out of the rain.
         In the desert you can't remember your name
         'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain.
         La la, la la    la la la, la la la, la la. 
         After two days in the desert sun, my skin began to turn red
         After three days in the desert fun,
         I was looking at a river bed.
         And the story it told of a river that flowed
         Made me sad to think it was dead.
         I've been through the desert on a horse with no name,
         It felt good to be out of the rain.

              After nine days I let the horse run free
         ’Cause the desert had turned to sea
         There were plants and birds and rocks and things
         There was sand and hills and rings
         The ocean is a desert with it’s life underground
         And a perfect disguise above
         Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
         But the humans will give no love
         I've been through the desert on a horse with no name,
         It felt good to be out of the rain.

Half a cup of Rock and Rye.
Farewell to you old Southern skies

Is what you left behind,
Get yourself a powder charge
And seal that silver mine.
Lost my boots in transit, babe,
A pile of smokin' leather.
I nailed a retread to my feet
And prayed for better weather.
They say that when your ship comes in,
The first man takes the sails;
The second takes the afterdeck,
The third the planks and rails
What's the point of callin' shots;
This cue ain't straight in line.
Cue ball's made of styrofoam
And no one's got the time.
Across the Rio Grandeeo, Across the lazy river.

in a country where they turned back time
you go strolling through the crowd like
Peter Lorre contemplating a crime.
She comes out of the sun in a silk dress
running like a water color in the rain.
Don't bother asking for explanations.
She'll just tell you that she came
She doesn't give you time for questions
as she locks up you arm in hers.
And you follow 'til your sense of
which direction completely disappears.
By the blue-tiled walls near the market stalls
there's a hidden door she leads you to.
""These days,"" she says, ""I feel my life just
like a river running through
Well she looks at you so cooly
and her eyes shine like the moon
She comes in incense and pathchouli
so you take her to find what's
waiting inside
Well morning comes and you're still with her
and the bus and the tourists are gone.
And you've thrown away your choice and
lost your ticket so you have to stay on.
But the drumbeat strains of the night
remain in the rhythm of the newborn day.
You know sometime you're bound to leave her
but for now you're gonna stay

48,Hard Headed Woman,Cat Stevens,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/cat-stevens/hard-headed-woman-chords-84499,"  I'm looking for a hard headed woman
  One who'll take me for myself
  And if I find my hard headed woman
  I won't need nobody else, no, no, no
       I know a lot of fancy dancers
       People who can glide you on a floor
       They move so smooth but have no answers
       When you ask ""why'd you come here for?""
       I know, many fine feathered friends
       but their friendliness depends on how you do
  I'm looking for a hard headed woman
  one who'll make me feel so good
  And if I find my hard headed woman
  I know my life will be as it should, yes, yes, yes
  I'm looking for a hard headed woman
  One who'll take me for myself
  And if I find my hard headed woman
  I won't need nobody else, no, no, no
      Hard headed woman
  I know, many fine feathered friends
  but their friendliness depends on how you do
  They know many sure fired ways
  To find out the one who pays and how you do

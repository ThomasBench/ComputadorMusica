0,Two Suns In The Sunset,Pink Floyd,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/pink-floyd/two-suns-in-the-sunset-chords-1456113,"8/8 | D   |
In my rear view mirror, the sun is going down.
Sinking behind bridges in the road,
I think of all the good things that we have left undone
And I suffer premonitions, confirmed suspicions,
   of the holocaust to come
The rusty wire that holds the cork, that keeps the anger in,
Gives way, then suddenly it's day again,
The sun is in the east, even though the day is done,
Two suns in the sunset, fffft
could be the human race is run
Like the moment when the brakes lock
And you slide towards the big truck     (Oh No)
You stretch the frozen moments with your fear  (Aaaaaaaaaaahh!!)
 And you'll never hear their voices  (Daddy Daddy!)
 And you'll never see their faces
 You have no recourse to the law, anymore
And as my windshield melts, and my tears evaporate,
Leaving only charcoal to defend,
Finally, I understand the feelings of the few,
Ashes and diamonds, foe and friend,
We were all equal in the end
(Solo as lib to fade)

ash in the pages, now I've got myself lost.    I was

The hurt and the anger and the joy of the pain

3,The End Of The Innocence,Don Henley,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/don-henley/the-end-of-the-innocence-chords-1053884,"I remember when the days were long,
and rolled beneath a deep blue sky
Didn't have a care in the world,
with mommy and daddy standing by
But happily ever after fails,
and we've been poisoned by these fairy tales
The lawyers dwell on small details,
since daddy had to fly
Ah, but I know a place where we can go,
that's still untouched by man
We'll sit and watch the clouds go by,
and the tall grass wave in the wind
You can lay your head back on the ground,
and let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense,
but this is the end,     this is the end
of the innocence
Oh beautiful for spacious skies,
but now those skies are threatening
They're beating plowshares into swords,
for this tired old man that we elected king
Armchair warriors often fail,
and we've been poisoned by these fairytales
The lawyers clean up all details,
since daddy had to lie
Ah, but I know a place where we can go,
that's still untouched by man
We'll sit and watch the clouds go by,
and the tall grass wave in the wind
You can lay your head back on the ground,
and let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense,
but this is the end,     this is the end
of the innocence
Who knows how long this will last,
or how we've come so far so fast
But somewhere back there in the dust,
that same small town in each of us
I need to remember this, 
so baby give me just one kiss
And let me take a long last look,
before we say goodbye
Just lay your head back on the ground,
and let your hair fall all around me
Offer up your best defense,
but this is the end,     this is the end,
of the innocence

And I didn't want to hear
But I knew that it would come
An old true friend of ours
Was talking on the phone
She said you'd found someone
And I thought of all the bad luck
And the struggles we went through
How I lost me, and you lost you
What are all these voices
Outside love's open door
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more
I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I knew
I'm learning again
I've been trying to get down
To the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about
Forgiveness, Forgiveness
Even if, Even if you don't love me anymore

So the pound has dropped and the children are creating
The other half ran away
Taking all the cash and leaving you with the lumber
Got a pain in the chest
Doctors on strike what you need is a rest
It's not easy love, but you've got friends you can trust
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand cos friends will be friends
Right till the end
Now it's a beautiful day,
The postman delivered a letter from your lover
Only a phone call away
You tried to track him down but somebody stole his number
As a matter of fact
You're getting used to life without him in your way
It's so easy now, cos you got friends you can trust
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention
Friends will be friends,
When you're through with life and all hope is lost
Hold out your hand cos friends will be friends

Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Boom, bah, bay, bay, boom, bah, bay, bay
Do day dah do day dah,  that's okay
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming, ""Let me out!""
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people - people on streets
Day, day, dee, dee dee oo, oo, bop. Okay!
Chippin' around, kick my brains 'round the floor

Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why, why, why...?

Insanity laughs under pressure we're cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?..
'Cause love's such an old-fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves

20,Romeo And Juliet (verÂ 2),Dire Straits,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/dire-straits/romeo-and-juliet-chords-739772," A lovestruck Romeo sings a streetsuss serenade
 Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
 Finds a street light, steps out of the shade
 Says something like, ""you and me babe, how about it?""
 Juliet says, ""hey it's Romeo, you nearly gave me a heart attack""
 He's underneath the window, she's singing, ""hey la my boyfriendâs back
 You shouldn't come around here, singing up to people like that
 Anyway, what you gonna do about it?""
 Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start
 And I bet and you exploded into my heart
 And I forget, I forget, the movie song
 When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?
 Come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame
 Both dirty, both mean, yes, and the dream was just the same
 And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real
 How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?
 When you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold
 You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
 You promised me everything, you promised me thick and thin, yeah
 Now you just say, ""oh Romeo, yeah, you know I used to have a scene with him""
 Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
 You said I love you like the stars above, I'll love you till I die
 There's a place for us, you know the movie song
 When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?
 I can't do the talks like they talk on the TV
 And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be
 I can't do everything but I'll do anything for you
 I can't do anything 'cept be in love with you
 And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be
 All I do is keep the beat; the bad company
 And all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme
 Juliet I'd do the stars with you any time
 Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
 You said I love you like the stars above; I'll love you till I die
 There's a place for us, you know the movie song
 When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?
 And a love struck Romeo sing the streets a serenade
 Laying everybody low with a love song that he made
 Find a convenient street light, steps out of the shade

I was shy, I turned away before she caught my eye
I was shakin' in my shoes whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Something had a hold on me when angel passed close by
Those soft and fuzzy sweaters, too magical to touch
To see her in that negligee is really just too much

I don't like to see so much pain
    So  much wasted
And this moment keeps slipping away
    I get so tired 
Working so hard for our survival
     I look to the time with you
    To keep me awake and alive
  And all my instincts,  they return
  And grand facade,  so soon will burn
  Without a noise,   without my pride

People make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know.

And say that I can't hold on
There's no easy way
It gets harder each day

To the name of this town in a desktop globe
Exit wound in a foreign nation
Showing the home of the one this was written for
My apartment looks upside down from there
Water spirals the wrong way out the sink
And her voice is a backwards record
It's like a whirlpool and it never ends
Ana Ng and I are getting old and we still haven't walked
In the glow of each other's majestic presence
Listen Ana hear my words, they're the ones you would think
I would say if there was a me for you
All alone at the '64 World's Fair
Eighty dolls yelling ""Small girl after all""
Who was at the Dupont Pavilion?
Why was the bench still warm? Who had been there?
Or the time when the storm tangled up the wire
To the horn on the pole at the bus depot
And in the back of the edge of hearing
These are the words that the voice was repeating:
Ana Ng and I are getting old and we still haven't walked
In the glow of each other's majestic presence
Listen Ana hear my words, they're the ones you would think
I would say if there was a me for you
When I was driving once I saw this painted on a bridge:
""I don't want the world, I just want your half""
They don't need me here, and I know you're there
Where the world goes by like the humid air
And it sticks like a broken record
Everything sticks like a broken record
Everything sticks until it goes away
And the truth is, we don't know anything

But on the Che Guevara highway filling up with gasoline
Fidel Castro's brother spies a rich lady who's crying
Over luxury's disappointment so he walks over and he's trying
To sympathise with her but he thinks that he should warn her
That the Third World is just around the corner
In the Soviet Union a scientist is blinded
By the resumption of nuclear testing and he is reminded
That Dr. Robert Oppenheimer's optimism fell
At the first hurdle
In the Cheese Pavilion and the only noise I hear
Is the sound of people stacking chairs and mopping up spilt beer
And someone asking questions and basking in the light
Of the fifteen fame filled minutes of the fanzine writer
Mixing Pop and Politics he asks me what the use is
I offer him embarrassment and my usual excuses
While looking down the corridor out to the where the van is waiting
I'm looking for the Great Leap Forwards
Jumble sales are organized and pamphlets have been posted
Even after closing time there's still parties to be hosted
You can be active with the activists or sleep in with the sleepers
While you're waiting for the Great Leap Forwards
One leap forward two leaps back
Will politics get me the sack?
Waiting for the Great Leap Forwards
Here comes the future and you can't run from it
If you've got a blacklist I want to be on it
Waiting for the Great Leap Forwards
It's a mighty long way down rock nd roll
From Top of the Pops to drawing the dole
Waiting for the Great Leap Forwards
If no one happens to understand  
Start your own revolution, cut out the middleman
Waiting for the Great Leap Forwards
So join the struggle while you may
The revolution is only a T-shirt away
Waiting for the Great Leap Forwards
In a perfect world we'd all sing in tune
But this reality so give me some room!
Waiting for the Great Leap Forwards
Waiting for the Great Leap Forwards   (Beam me up Scotty!)

But I can see you, your brown skin shining in the sun.
You got your hair combed back and your sunglasses on, baby.

After the boys of summer have gone.
I never will forget those nights. I wonder if it was a dream.
Remember how you made me crazy, Remember how I made you scream.
Now I don't understand what Happened to our love.
But baby, when I get you back, I'm gonna show you what I'm made of.

I can tell you my love for you will still be strong

You got your top pulled down and your radio on, baby

I was dreaming in my dreaming
Of an aspect bright and fair
And my sleeping, it was broken 
But my dream it lingered near
In the form of shining valleys 
Where the pure air recognised
And my senses newly opened
I awakened to the cry
That the people have the power
To redeem the work of fools
Upon the meek the graces shower
It's decreed, the people rule
People have the power
People have the power
People have the power 
People have the power
Vengeful aspects became suspect
And bending low as if to hear
And the armies ceased advancing
Because the people had their ear
And the shepherds and the soldiers 
Lay beneath among the stars
Exchanging visions and laying arms
To waste in the dust
In the form of shining valleys 
Where the pure air recognised
And my senses newly opened 
I awakened to the cry 
People have the power
People have the power
People have the power 
People have the power
Where there were deserts I saw fountains 
Like cream the waters rise 
And we strolled there together 
With none to laugh or criticise 
And the leopard and the lamb 
Lay together truly bound 
I was hoping in my hoping 
To recall what I had found
I was dreaming in my dreaming 
God knows a purer view 
As I lay down to my sleeping 
I commit my dream to you 
People have the power
People have the power
People have the power 
People have the power
The power to dream, to rule 
To wrestle the world from fools 
It's decreed, the people rule 
It's decreed, the people rule 
Listen, I believe everything we dream 
Can come to pass through our union 
We can turn the world around 
We can turn the earth's revolution 
People have the power
People have the power
People have the power 
People have the power
The power to dream, to rule 
To wrestle the world from fools

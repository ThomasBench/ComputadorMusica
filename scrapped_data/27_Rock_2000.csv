0,La Mar The Ocean (ver 2),The Beautiful Girls,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-beautiful-girls/la-mar-the-ocean-chords-694836,"This day is getting older,
in fading light it's beautiful.
This wind is blowing colder,
and too soon I'll feel it's pull.
Still, I took all my chances,
earned myself an even score.
Try to learn my lessons well.
And I don't have the answers,
for those questions anymore.
Only love can be both heaven and hell.
So sturdy up, sturdy up your heart,
for the road is long ahead.
I'll be with you even though we're apart,
but your road is yours to tread.
And so it goes, and so it goes,
and so it goes, slows your mind, mind, mind,
And so it goes... and so it goes, and so it goes, slows your mind, mind, mind, mind, mind.
I've grown old on this ocean,
gave her all, my stronger years.
Gave my wife my devotion,
when she died, the ocean my tears.
I've tried to teach you well son,
all of everything I knew.
Of how to live this life be true.
Don't bow your head to no one,
and no matter what you do,
if you start then see it through.
So sturdy up, sturdy up your heart,
for the road is long ahead.
I'll be with you even though we're apart,
but your road is yours to tread.
And so it goes, and so it goes,
and so it goes, slows your mind, mind, mind,
And so it goes... and so it goes, and so it goes, slows your mind, mind, mind.

And things go wrong no matter what I do
Now and then it seems like life is just too much
But you've got the love I need to see me through

Oh
When friends are gone I know my take on love is real
You know it's real
Cause you got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
Time after time I think, ""Oh Lord what's the use?""
Time after time I think its just no good

Got on the bus put my headphones on and pressed play

And your mama
Takes a shine to her best son
All the girls, they seem to like you
Cause you're handsome,
Like to talk, and a whole lot of fun
But now your girl's gone a missin'
And your house has got an empty bed
The folks'll wonder 'bout the wedding
They won't listen to a word you said
Gonna take your mama out all night
Yeah, we'll show her what it's all about
We'll get her jacked up on some cheap champagne
We'll let the good times all roll out
And if the music ain't good, well it's just too bad
We're gonna sing along no matter what
Because the dancers don't mind at the New Orleans
If you tip 'em and they make a cut
Do it
Take your mama out all night
So she'll have no doubt
That we're doing all the best we can
Gonna do it
Take your mama out all night
You can stay up late
'cause baby you're a full grown man
It's a struggle
Livin' like a good boy oughta
In the summer
Watchin' all the girls pass by
When your mama
Heard the way that you'd been talking
I tried to tell you
That all she'd wanna do is cry
Now we end up takin' the long way home
Lookin' overdressed wearin' buckets of stale cologne
It's so hard to see streets on a country road
When your glasses in the garbage
And your Continental's just been towed
Gonna take your mama out all night
Yeah, we'll show her what it's all about

This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have
All of me
You used to captivate me
By your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts
My once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away
All of the sanity in me
These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have
All of me
I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have
All of me

Adding their breeze to the summer nights.
Outside, water like air was great.

I surrender my heart
here I stand take my hand

this earth was just a field
of cold and lonely space
without you
now everything's alive
now everything's revealed
and the story of my life
is all about you
So if you feel the cool winds
blowing through your nights
I will shelter you

your fears away

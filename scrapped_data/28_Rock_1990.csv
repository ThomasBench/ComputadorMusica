Even then the folks in town said with prejudised eyes
That boy's not right

And saw the man inside

She loves to watch the sun go down
We used to walk along the ri.... ver
And dream our way out of this town
No one understood what I felt for Mary
No one cared until the night she went out walking all alone
And never came home
Man with the badge came knocking next morning
Here was I surrounded by a thousand fingers suddenly
Pointing right at me
I swear I left her by the river
I swear I left her safe and sound

1,She (ver 2),Elvis Costello,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/elvis-costello/she-chords-1509278,"She may be the face I can't forget 
A trace of pleasure or regret 
May be my treasure or the price I have to pay
She may be the song that summer sings 
May be the chill that autumn brings 
May be a hundred different things
Within the measure of a day 
She may be the beauty or the beast 
May be the famine or the feast 
May turn each day into a Heaven or a Hell 
She may be the mirror of my dreams
A smile reflected in a stream 
She may not be what she may seem 
Inside her shell.... 
She, who always seems so happy in a crowd 
Whose eyes can be so private and so proud 
No one's allowed to see them when they cry 
She maybe the love that cannot hope to last 
May come to me from shadows of the past
That I'll remember 'til the day I die
She maybe the reason I survive 
The why and wherefore I'm alive 
The one I'll care for through the rough and ready years 
Me, I'll take her laughter and her tears 
And make them all my souvenirs
For where she goes I've got to be
The meaning of my life is 
She....She 
Oh, she....

Well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....
Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....
Baby I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
But love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....
Well there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me do you
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelu-u-u-u-jah ....
Well, maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
It's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light

And the radio

Where is the life that I recognize?
Gone away

Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Passion or coincidence
Once prompted you to say
""Pride will tear us both apart""

Cross the rooftops
Run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart
What is happening to me?

Where is my friend when I need you most?

Tell of suffering and greed
Fear today, forgot tomorrow

Without you...
   Another tricky situation
   A get to drowin' in the blues
   And I find myself thinkin' 
   Well - what would you do? 
   Yes! - it was such an operation
   Forever paying every due
   Hell, you made a sensation
   You found a way through - and
One by    one
Only the good die   young
They're only flyin' too close to the sun
We'll remember -
Forever...
   And now the party must be over
   I guess we'll never understand
   The sense of your leaving
   Was it the way it was planned? 
   And so we grace another table
   And raise our glasses one more time
   There's a face at the window
   And I ain't never, never sayin' goodbye...

  Only the good die   young
  They're only flyin' too close to the sun
  Cryin' for nothing
  Cryin' for no-one
  No-one but you

To Jerusalem.""

Where many martyrs fell
And I know no one can sing the blues

As they were taking down the tents
The stars above the barren trees
Were his only audience
Them charcoal gypsy maidens
Can strut their feathers well
But nobody can sing the blues

See them big plantations burning
Hear the cracking of the whips
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming
(And) see the ghosts of slavery ships
I can hear them tribes a-moaning
(I can) hear the undertaker's bell
(Yeah), nobody can sing the blues

There's a woman by the river
With some fine young handsome man
He's dressed up like a squire
Bootlegged whiskey in his hand
There's a chain gang on the highway
I can hear them rebels yell
And I know no one can sing the blues

Well, God is in heaven
And we all want what's his
But power and greed and corruptible seed
Seem to be all that there is

Of the St. James Hotel

Where the great plains begin
At the hundredth meridian

Where the great plains begin
Driving down a corduroy road
Weeds standing shoulder high
Ferris wheel is rusting
Off in the distance
At the hundredth meridian
At the hundredth meridian
At the hundredth meridian
Where the great plains begin
Left alone to get gigantic
Hard, huge and haunted
A generation so much dumber than it’s parents
Came crashing through the window
A raven strains along the line of the road
carrying muddy old skull
The wires whistle their approval
Off down the distance
At the hundredth meridian (hundredth meridian)
At the hundredth meridian (you’re going to miss me)
At the hundredth meridian (trust me)

And I remember Hengelo
It would seem to me
I remember every single fucking thing I know
If I die of vanity, promise me, promise me
If they bury me some place I don’t want to be
You’ll dig me up and transport me, unceremoniously
Away from the swollen city breeze, garbage bag trees
Whispers of disease and the acts of enormity
And lower me slowly and sadly and properly
Get Ry Cooder to sing my eulogy
At the hundredth meridian (hundredth meridian)
At the hundredth meridian (you’re going to miss me)

We'll just keep on trying
Till the end of time

48,Ironic (ver 2),Alanis Morissette,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/alanis-morissette/ironic-chords-560766,"An old man turned ninety-eight
He won the lottery  and died the next day
It's a black fly in your chardonnay
it's a death row pardon two minutes too late
and isn't it Ironic?    Don't you think?
It's like rain_____   on your wedding day
It's a free ride______  when you've already paid
It's the good advice_____  that you just didn't take
And who would've thought it figures
Mr. Play-it-Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids good-bye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
and as the plane crashed down he thought ""well isn't this nice""
and isn't it Ironic?    Don't you think?
It's like rain_____   on your wedding day
It's a free ride______  when you've already paid
It's the good advice_____  that you just didn't take
And who would've thought it figures
Well life has a funny way of sneaking up on you when you think everything's
okay and everything's going right
And life has a funny way of helping you out when you think everythings gone
wrong and everything blows up in your face
A traffic jam when you're already late
a no-smoking-sign on your zigarette break
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the men of my dreams an then meeting his beautiful wife
and isn't it ironic?  Don't you think?
a little too ironic     And yeah i really do think
It's like rain_____   on your wedding day
It's a free ride______  when you've already paid
It's the good advice_____  that you just didn't take
And who would've thought it figures
Life has a funny way of sneaking up on you
Life has a funny, funny way of helping you out
helping you out

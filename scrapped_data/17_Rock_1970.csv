She stayed with me just long enough to rescue me
And she told me a story yesterday
About the sweet love between the moon and the deep blue sea
And then she spread her wings high over me
She said she’s gonna come back tomorrow          And I said
Fly on my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Tomorrow I’m gonna be by your side
Sure enough this morning she came unto me
Silver wings silhouetted against a childs sunrise
And my angel she said unto me
Today is the day for you to rise
Take my hand your gonna be my man your gonna rise
And then she took me high over yonder
Fly on my sweet angel
Fly on through the sky
Fly on my sweet angel
Forever I’m gonna be by your side

warm over here. You've got so much to say, say what you mean,
mean what you're thinking, and think anything.
Oh why, why must you waste your life away,
You've got to live for today, then let it go
Oh, lover, I want to spend this time with you,
There's nothing I wouldn't do, if you let me know.
And I can't keep it in, I can't hide it and I can't lock it away.
I'm up for your love, love heats my blood,
Blood spins my head, and my head falls in love, oh.
No, I can't keep it in, I can't keep it in, I've gotta let it out.
I've gotta show the world, world's got to know,
Know of the love, love that lies low, so
why can't you say, if you know, then why can't you say.
You've got too much deceit, deceit kills the light,
light needs to shine, I said shine light , shine light.
Love, that's no way to live your life,
You allow too much to go by, and that won't do.
No, lover, I want to have you here by my side
Now don't you run, don't you hide, while I'm with you.
No I can't keep it in, I can't keep it in, I've gotta let it out.
I've got to show the world, worlds got to see, see all the love

Maman ne travaille plus sans ses exitants

Je suis chargé d’électricité
Si par malheur au coeur de l’accélérateur
J’rencontre une particule qui m’mette de sale humeur

When you put me on the Wolverine up to Annandale
It was still September when your daddy was quite surprised
To find you with the working girls in the county jail
I was smoking with the boys upstairs
When I heard about the whole affair
I said,  Oh   no
William and Mary won't do 
Well I did not think the girl
Could be   so    cruel
And I'm never going back
To my   old     school
Oleanders growing outside her door
Soon they're gonna be in bloom up in Annandale
I can't stand her doing what she did before
Living like a Gypsy queen in a fairy tale
Well I hear the whistle but I can't go
I'm gonna take her down to Mexico

Guadalajara won't do
Well I did not think the girl
Could be    so  cruel
And I'm never going back
To my    old    school
California tumbles into the sea
That'll be the day I go back to Annandale
Tried to warn you about Chino and Daddy Gee
But I can't seem to get to you through the U.S.Mail

Put another log on the fire for me

Look out my window, what do I see
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me

And it looks as though they're here to stay
What are we coming to
No room for me no fun for you
I think about a world to come
Where the books were found by the Golden Ones
Written in pain written in awe
By a puzzled man who questioned what we were here for
All the strangers came today

Gotta make way for the homo superior
Look out at your children
See their faces in golden rays

The earth is a bitch, we've finished our news
Homo sapiens have outgrown their use

I wonder what's gone wrong, I can't help but wonder what's gone wrong

I dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly
And looking back down on me smiled reassuringly
And I dreamed I was flying....
And high up above my eyes could clearly see
The Statue of Liberty - sailing away to sea
And I dreamed I was flying.
For we come on the ship they call Mayflower
We come on the ship that sailed the moon
We come in the ages most uncertain hours and sing an American Tune

For days and nights they battled the Bantu to their knees
They killed to earn their living and to help out the Congolese

And I'm a handsome son of a bitch
Women's liberation
Came creeping all across the nation
I tell you people, I was not ready
When I fucked this dyke by the name of Freddy
She made a little speech then
Uuh, she tried to make me say when
She had my balls in a vice, but she left the dick
I guess it's still hooked on but now it shoots too quick
Oh God I am the American dream
But now I smell like Vaseline
I'm a miserable son of a bitch
So I went out and bought me a leisure suit
I jingle my change, but I'm still kinda cute
Got a job doing radio promo
And none of the jocks can even tell I'm a homo
Eventually me and a friend
Sort of drifted along into S&M
I can take about an hour on the tower of power
As long as I gets a little golden shower

48,Words,Neil Young,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/neil-young/words-chords-88644," Someone and someone were down by the pond
 Lookin' for somethin' to plant in the lawn.
 Out in the fields they were turnin' the soil
 I'm sittin' here hopin' this water will boil
 When I look through the window and out on the road
 They're bringin' me presents and saying hello.
 Singing Words words between the lines of age.
 Words words between the lines of age.
 If I was a junkman sellin' you cars,
 Washin' your windows and shinin' your stars,
 Thinkin' your mind was my own in a dream
 What would you wonder and how would it seem?
 Livin' in castles a bit at a time
 The King started laughin' and talkin' in rhyme.
 Singing Words, Words between the lines of age
 Words words between the lines of age.

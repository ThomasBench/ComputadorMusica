0,Youre A Big Girl Now,Bob Dylan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bob-dylan/youre-a-big-girl-now-chords-1010115," Our conversation  was short and sweet
 It nearly swept me  off-a my feet.
And I'm back in the rain, oh
And you are on dry land,
You made it there somehow
  You're a big girl now.
 Bird on the horizon, sittin' on fence
 He's singin' his song for me at his own expense
And I'm just like that bird, oh,
Singin' just for you
I hope that you can hear,
  Hear me singin' through these tears.
  Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
  Oh, but what a shame that all we've shared can't last.
I can change, I swear, oh
See what you can do
I can make it through,
  You can make it    too.
  Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
  You've known it all the time, I'm learnin' it these days .
Oh, I know where I can find you, oh,
In somebody's room.
It's a price I have to pay
  You're a big girl all the way.
  A change in the weather is known to be extreme
  But what's the sense in changing horses in midstream?
I'm going out of my mind, oh
With a pain that stops and starts,
Like a corkscrew to my heart
 Ever since we've been apart.
                             (fade out)

She wrote one time'n sent her love

I wonder what kind of love she's thinkin' of.
Dear Katie,
If you can hear me,
I can't wait to have ya near me.
Oh, Katie, since ya 
caught that bus,
Well, I just don't know how things are with us.
I'm still here and you're out there.
Katie laughed when I said I was lonely.
She said, There's no need t'feel that way.
Katie said that I was her only one,
But then I wonder why she didn't wanna stay.
Dear Katie, 
if I'm the only one,
How much longer will you be gone?
Oh, Katie, won't ya tell me straight:
I'll believe you,
But please come through.
I know it's wrong to be apart this long;
You should be here, near me.    
Katie's been gone and now her face is slowly fading from my mind.
She's gone to find some newer places, Left the old life far behind.
Dear Katie, dont ya miss your home?
I dont see why you had to roam.
Dear Katie, since you've been away
I lose a little something every day
I need you here, but you're still out there.
Dear Katie, please drop me a line,
just write, Love, to tell me you're fine.
Oh, Katie, if you can hear me,
I just cant wait to have you near me.
I can only think where are you,
What ya do, may be there's someone new.

3,Hurricane (ver 2),Bob Dylan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bob-dylan/hurricane-chords-1702305,"Pistol shots ring out in the bar room night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
She cries out ""My God they killed them all""
Here comes the story of the Hurricane 
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell but one time
He could have been the champion of the world
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
And another man named Bello movin' around mysteriously
""I didn't do it"" he says and he throws up his hands
""I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand 
I saw them leaving"" he says and he stops
One of us had better call up the cops
And so Patty calls the cops 
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights 
Flashing on the hot New Jersey night
Meanwhile somewhere in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around
The number one contender for the middleweight crown 
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
When a cop pulled them over to the side of the road 
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson that's just the way things go
If you're black you might as well not show up on the street
Less you wanna draw the heat
Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dextor Bradley were just down prowling around
He said ""I saw two men runnin' out, they looked like middleweights
They jumped in to a white car with out of state plates""
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
The cops said ""Wait a minute boys, this one's not dead""
So they took him to the infirmary 
And although the man could hardly see
He told them that he could identify the guilty man
Four in the morning and they hauled Rubin in
They took him to the hospital and brought him upstairs
The wounded man looked up through his one dying eye
Says ""Why you bring him in for? He ain't the guy
Yes, here is the story of the Hurricane 
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done 
Put in a prison cell but one time 
He could have been the champion of the world
Four months later the ghetto all in flame
Rubin's in South America fighting for his name
While Author Dexter Bradley still in the robbery game
And the cops are putting the screws to him looking for someone to blame
""Remember that murder that happened in the bar?""
""Remember you said you saw the getaway car?""
""You think you'd like to play ball with the law?""
""Think it might have been that fighter that you saw runnin' that night""
""Don't forget that you are white""
Arthur Dextor Bradley said ""I'm really not sure""
Cops said ""A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job and we're talking to your friend Bello
Now you don't want to go back to jail, be a nice fellow
You'll be doing society a favor
That son of bitch is brave and getting braver
We want to put his ass in a stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain't no gentleman Jim""
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
""It's my work"" he'd say ""I do it for pay""
And when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way
Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along the trail
But then they took him to the jailhouse 
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse
All Rubin's cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig circus, he never had a chance
The judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all white jury agreed
Rubin Carter was falsely tried 
The crime was murder one and guess who testified
Bello and Bradley and they both badly lied
And the newspapers all went along for the ride
How can the life of such a man 
Be in the palm of some fool's hand
To see him obviously framed
Couldn't help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
Where justice is a game
Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink Martinis and watch the sun rise
While Rubin sit like Buddha in a ten foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell
That's the story of the Hurricane 
But it won't be over 'til they clear his name
And give him back the time he's done
Put in a prison cell but one time 
He could have been the champion of the world

I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love.
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong.
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawlin' down the avenue
No, there's nothin' that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love.
The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
And on the highway of regrets
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothin' like me yet.

Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love.

But I never knew how far down
I was falling,
before I reached the bottom
I was cold and you were fire
And I never knew how the pyre
Could be burning,
on the edge of the ice field
And the now chilly California wind,
is blowing down our bodies again
And were sinking deeper and deeper into the chilly California sand
Oh, I know you belong inside my aching heart
And can't you see my faded Levis bursting apart?
And don't you hear me crying;
Oh babe, don't go?
And don't you hear me screaming;
How was I to know? 
I'm in the middle of nowhere,
near the end of the line
But there's a border to somewhere waiting,
and there's a tankful of time
Oh, give me just another moment, to see the light of the day,
and take me to another land where, I don't have to stay
And I'm going to need somebody to make me feel like you do
And I will receive somebody with open arms, open eyes,
Open up the sky and let the planet that I love shine through
For crying out loud,
you know I love you
For crying out loud,
you know I love you
For crying out loud,
you know I love you
I was damned and you were saved,
and I never knew how enslaved,
I was kneeling;
in the chains of my master
I could laugh but you could cry,
and I never knew just how high,
I was flying;
ah, with you right above me
And the now chilly California wind,
is blowing down our bodies again
And were sinking deeper and deeper into the chilly California sand

For crying out loud,
you know I love you
For crying out loud,
you know I love you
For taking in the rain when I'm feeling so dry,
for giving me the answers when I'm asking you why,
and my oh my,
for that I thank you
for giving me a child when my body is old,
and don't you know,
for that I need you?
for finding me a highway and driving me home,
and you got to know,
for that I serve you?
for revving me up when I'm starting to stall,
and all in all,
for that I want you
For praying for my future in the days that remain,
Oh, lord,
for that I hold you

So I can't see her letting him go
Walk out of her heart
Walk out of her mind

In her frock coat and bipperty-bopperty hat

She's an old-time ambassador 
Of sweet talking, night walking games
And she's known in the darkest clubs
For pushing ahead of the dames
If she says she can do it
Then she can do it, she don't make false claims
But she's a Queen, and such are queens
That your laughter is sucked in their brains

Every night that goes between
I feel a little less
As you slowly go away from me
This is only another test
Every night you do not come
Your softness fades away
Did I ever really care that much?
Is there anything left to say?
Every hour of fear I spend
My body tries to cry
Living through each empty night
A deadly call inside
I haven't felt this way I feel
Since many a year ago
But in those years and the lifetimes past
I did not deal with the road
And I did not deal with you I know
Though the love has always been
So I search to find an answer there
So I can truly win
Every hour of fear I spend
My body tries to cry
Living through each empty night
A deadly call inside
So I try to say goodbye my friend
I'd like to leave you with something warm
But never have I been a blue, calm sea
I have always ...  been a storm
Always ...  been a storm
Ooh, always ...  been a storm

Es war ein schöner Tag, der letzte im August.
Die Sonne brannte so, als hätte sie's gewusst.
Die Luft war flirrend heiß, und um allein zu sein,
sagte ich den andern: Ich hab' heut' keine Zeit.
Da traf ich sie und sah in ihre Augen.
Und irgendwie hatt' ich das Gefühl,
als winkte sie mir zu und schien zu sagen:
  Komm setz' dich zu mir.
Ich war sechzehn und sie einunddreißig
und über Liebe wusste ich nicht viel;
sie wusste alles und sie ließ mich spüren:
  Ich war kein Kind mehr.   Und es war Sommer
Sie gab sich so, als sei ich überhaupt nicht da.
Und um die Schultern trug sie nur ihr langes Haar.
Ich war verlegen und ich wusste nicht wohin
mit meinem Blick, der wie gefesselt an ihr hing.
Ich kann verstehen , hörte ich sie sagen,
nur weil du jung bist, tust du nicht, was du fühlst.
Doch bleib bei mir, bis die Sonne rot wird;
dann wirst du sehen.“
Wir gingen beide hinunter an den Strand,
und der Junge nahm schüchtern ihre Hand.
Doch als ein Mann sah ich die Sonne aufgeh'n.
Und es war Sommer.

Soft,  strong, sweet and true.

Tapping at the window, touch your hair
So swift and bright strange figures of light float  in air.
Who can stop what must arrive now?
Something new is waiting  to be born
Dark as the night you're still by my side shine   inside.
Gone are the days we stopped to decide
Where we should go, we just ride.
Gone are the broken eyes we saw through in dreams
Gone, both dream and lie.
Life may be sweeter for this, I don't know,

While Lady Lullaby sings plainly through you
Love  still  rings  true.
Midnight on a carousel ride
Reaching for the gold ring down inside
Never could reach it, just slips away but I try.

Goodbye papa, it's hard to die, when all the birds are singing in the sky.
Now that the spring is in the air.
Little children everywhere,   when you see them I'll be there.
We had joy, we had fun. We had seasons in the sun,
but the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone.
We had joy, we had fun. We had seasons in the sun,
but the wine and the song like the seasons have all gone.
Goodbye Michelle, my little one. You gave me love and helped me find the sun.
And every time that I was down,
you would always come around and get my feet back on the ground.
Goodbye Michelle it's hard to die, when all the birds are singing in the sky.
now that the spring is in the air.
With the flowers everywhere,  I wish that we could both be there.
We had joy, we had fun. We had seasons in the sun,
but the stars we could reach were just starfish on the beach.

All our lives we had fun, we had seasons in the sun,

44,Lost In The Flood (ver 3),Bruce Springsteen,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bruce-springsteen/lost-in-the-flood-chords-842283,"The ragamuffin gunner is returnin' home like a hungry runaway
He walks through town all alone
He must be from the fort he hears the high school girls say
His countryside's burnin' with wolfman fairies dressed in drag for homicide
The hit and run, plead sanctuary, `neath a holy stone they hide
They're breakin' beams and crosses with a spastic's reelin' perfection
Nuns run bald through Vatican halls pregnant, pleadin' immaculate 
conception
And everybody's wrecked on Main Street from drinking unholy blood
Sticker smiles sweet as gunner breathes deep, his ankles caked in mud
And I said ""Hey gunner man that's quicksand, that's quicksand that ain't 
mud
Have you thrown your senses to the war or did you lose them in the flood?"" ...
That pure American brother, dull-eyed and empty-faced
Races Sundays in Jersey in a Chevy stock super eight
He rides `er low on the hip, on the side he's got Bound For Glory in red, 
White and blue flash paint
He leans on the hood telling racing stories, the kids call him Jimmy The 
Saint
Well the blaze and noise boy, he's gunnin' that bitch loaded to blastin' 
point
He rides head first into a hurricane and disappears into a point
And there's nothin' left but some blood where the body fell
That is, nothin' left that you could sell
Just junk all across the horizon, a real highwayman's farewell
And he said ""Hey kid, you think that's oil? Man, that ain't oil that's 
blood""
I wonder what he was thinking when he hit that storm
Or was he just lost in the flood? 
Eighth Avenue sailors in satin shirts whisper in the air
Some storefront incarnation of Maria, she's puttin' on me the stare
And Bronx's best apostle stands with his hand on his own hard ware
Everything stops, you hear five, quick shots, the cops come up for air
And now the whiz-bang gang from uptown, they're shootin' up the street
And that cat from the Bronx starts lettin' loose
but he gets blown right off his feet
And some kid comes blastin' round the corner but a cop puts him right away
He lays on the street holding his leg screaming something in Spanish
Still breathing when I walked away
And somebody said ""Hey man did you see that?
His body hit the street with such a beautiful thud""
I wonder what the dude was sayin' or was he just lost in the flood?
Hey man, did you see that, those poor cats are sure messed up
I wonder what they were gettin' into, or were they just lost in the flood?

And I can see it very well
There's a joke and I know it very well,
It's one of those that I told you long ago
Take my word I'm a madman don't you know
Once a fool had a good part in the play
If it's so would I still be here today
It's quite peculiar in a funny sort of way                                      
They think it's very funny everything I say
. . . Get a load of him he's so insane  
  We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
  The inlaws hope they'll see you very soon 
   But is it in your conscience that you're after
The ground's a long way down but I need more
 Is the nightmare black or are the windows painted
Will they come again next week  can my mind  really take it

Bopping in the country, fishing in a stream
Looking for an answer trying to find a sign
Until I saw your city lights honey I was blind
They said get back honky cat
Well I quit those days and my redneck ways
mmmmmm oh the change is gonna do me good
You better get back honky cat
It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
It's like trying to drink whisky, oh, from a bottle of wine
Well I read some books and I read some magazines
About those high class ladies down in New Orleans
And all the folks back home well, said I was a fool
They said oh, believe in the Lord is the golden rule
They said get back honky cat
Well I quit those days and my redneck ways
mmmmmm oh the change is gonna do me good
They said get back honky cat
Well I quit those days and my redneck ways
mmmmmm oh the change is gonna do me good
They said stay at home boy, you gotta tend the farm
Living in the city boy, is going to break your heart
But how can you stay, when your heart says no?
How can you stop when your feet say go?

That weren't no DJ that was hazy cosmic jive....

There's a starman waiting in the sky, he's told us not to blow it, cause he knows it all worthwhile

Switch on the TV we may pick him on Channel 2...

I could lie to myself but it's true
There's no de-nyin when I look in your eyes
Girl I'm out of my head over you
I lived so long be-lieving all love is blind
But everything about you is tellin me this time
It's for-ev-er, this time I know it there's no doubt in my mind
For-ev-er. Until my life is through, girl I'll be lovin you for-ev-er.
I hear the echo of the promise I made
When your strong you can stand on your own
But those words grow distant as I look in your face.
No I don't wanna go it alone.
I never thought I'd lay my heart on the line
But everything about you is telling me this time
It's for-ev-er, this time I know it there's no doubt in my mind
For-ev-er. Until my life is through, girl I'll be lovin you for-ev-er.
  I see my future when I look in your eyes
  It took your love to make my heart come alive
  Cause I lived my life believing all love is blind
But everything about you is tellin' me this time
It's for-ev-er, this time I know it there's no doubt in my mind
For-ev-er. Until my life is through, girl I'll be lovin you for-ev-er.

Are you ready for the time of your life, it's time you stand up and fight,
it's all right, it's all right. 
Hand in hand we'll take a caravan to the motherland.
One by one we're gonna stand up with pride, one that can't be denied.
Stand up, stand up!
From the highest mountain (and) valley low, we'll join together with hearts of gold.
Now the children of the world can see there's a better place for us to be.
The place in which we were born, so neglected and torn apart.
Ev'ry woman, ev'ry man join the caravan of love,
Stand up, stand up, stand up.
Ev'rybody take a stand, join the caravan of love,
Stand up, stand up, stand up.
I'm your brother, I'm your brother, don't you know?
She's my sister, she's my sister, don't you know?
We'll be living in a world of peace in the day when ev'ryone is free.
Well, the young and the old, won't you let your love flow from your heart?
Ev'ry woman, ev'ry man join the caravan of love,
Stand up, stand up, stand up.

We'd go down to the river,
and into the river we'd dive
Oh, down to the river we'd ride
Then I got Mary pregnant,
and man that was all she wrote
And for my nineteenth birthday, I got a union card, and a wedding coat
We went down to the courthouse,
and the judge put it all to rest
No wedding day smiles, no walk down the aisle,
no flowers, no wedding dress
That night we went down to the river
and into the river we'd dive
Oh, down to the river we'd ride

But lately there ain't been much work, on account of the economy
Now, all them things that seemed so important,
well, mister they vanished right into the air
Now I just act like I don't remember;
Mary acts like she don't care
But I remember us riding in my brother's car,
her body tan and wet down at the reservoir
At night on them banks I'd lie awake,
and pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
Now those memories come back to haunt me,
they haunt me like a curse
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true,
or is it something worse?
That sends me down to the river,

That sends me down to the river tonight

Speeding like a man on the run
A lifetime spent preparing for the journey
He is closer now, as the search is on
Reading from a map in the mind
Yes, there's that rugged hill and there's a boat on the river.
And when the rain came down,
He heard a wild dog howl.
There were voices in the night. (don't do it)
Voices out of sight. (don't do it)
""Too many men have failed before; whatever you do,
Don't pay the ferryman
Don't even fix a price
Don't pay the ferryman
Until he gets you to the other side""
In the rolling mist as he gets on board
Now there'll be no turning back
Beware that hooded old man at the rudder
And the lightning flashed and the thunder rolled
And people calling out his name
And dancing bones that jabbered and a-moaned on the water.
And then the ferryman said
""there is trouble ahead
So you must pay me now"" (don't do it)
""You must pay me now"" (don't do it)
And still that voice came from beyond: ""whatever you do,
   Yea....

    Läheisyyttäsi kaipaan, rakkauttasi tarvitsen.
    Olen sinussa kiinni ja sinuun kiinni jään. Sano:
    ""Pois!"" ja minä menen. Kohta huomaat, etten mennyt mihinkään.

And we were so gung-ho to lay down our lives
We came in spastic like tameless horses,
We left in plastic as numbered corpses
And we learned fast to travel light, 
Our arms were heavy but our bellies were tight
We had no home front, we had no soft soap
They sent us Playboy, they gave us Bob Hope
We dug in deep    and shot on sight
And prayed to Jesus Christ with all of our might
We had no cameras to shoot the landscape
We passed the hash pipe and played our Doors tapes
And it was dark, so dark at night
And we held on to each other, like brother to brother,
We promised our mothers we'd write
And we would all go down together,
We said we'd all go down  together,
Yes, we would all go down    together
Remember Charlie, remember Baker,
They left their childhood on every acre
And who was wrong? And who was right?
It didn't matter in the thick of the fight
We held the day in the palm of our hand
They ruled the night and the night seemed to last as long as 
Six weeks on Parris Island
We held the coastline, they held the highlands,
And they were sharp, as sharp as knives,
They heard the hum of motors, they counted the rotors
And waited for us to arrive
And we would all go down together,
We said we'd all go down  together,

entra odio ed esce amore
dal nome Gloria.

manchi come il sale
mi manchi piu del sole
sciogli questa neve
che soffoca il mio petto

scappa senza far rumore
dal lavore dal tuo letto
dai gradini di un altare
ti aspetto Gloria.

e invece di dormire
con la memoria torna
a un tuffo nei papaveri
in una terra libera
per chi respira nebbia
per chi respira rabbia
per me che senza Gloria
con te nuda sul divano
faccio stelle di cartone
pensando a Gloria.

Now there's a storm on my radar, but I can still fly
but you are the reason for the blue in my sky
Josephine, I'll send you all my love,
Josephine
Life without meaning, I was walking away
In the coldest of winters the night becomes day
Josephine, I'll send you all my love
and every single step I take, I'll take for you         my--------- Jo-seph-
-ine, I'll send you all my love,        Joseph-

Of you and I engaged in a kiss
The sweat of your body covers me
Can you my darling
Can you picture this?
Dream if you can a courtyard
An ocean of violets in bloom
Animals strike curious poses
They feel the heat
The heat between me and you
How can you just leave me standing?
Alone in a world that's so cold? (So cold)
Maybe I'm just too demanding
Maybe I'm just like my father too bold
Maybe you're just like my mother
She's never satisfied (She's never satisfied)
Why do we scream at each other
This is what it sounds like
When doves cry
Touch if you will my stomach
Feel how it trembles inside
You've got the butterflies all tied up
Don't make me chase you
Even doves have pride

Fill my guts and ease my head
Through the early morning sun

Cut loose, cause you're no use

You're a no-one nowhere washed up

Slurps upon my every word

On a day like today
I'll get away from
This constant debauchery
The wind in my hair
Makes me so aware
How good it is to live

Of so many other nights

Oh God, it's raining
And I'm not containing
My pleasure at being
So wet
Here on my own
All on my own
How good it feels to be alone

And I haven't felt so alive
In years
Is shining in the sky
Reminding me
Of so many other nights

I've been mistaken for dead

0,Jet Black Heart (ver 2),5 Seconds Of Summer,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/5-seconds-of-summer/jet-black-heart-chords-1762900,"Everybody’s got their demons
even wide awake or dreaming
I’m the one who ends up leaving, make it ok
See a war I wanna fight it
See a match I wanna strike it
Every fire I’ve ignited faded to grey
But now that I’m broken
And now that you know it
Caught up in a moment
Can you see inside?
And there’s a hurricane underneath it
Trying to keep us apart
I write with a poison pen
But these chemicals moving between us
Are the reason to start again
Now im holding on for dear life
There’s no way that we could rewind 
Maybe there’s nothing after midnight
That could make you stay
But now that I’m broken
And now that you know it
Caught up in a moment
Can you see inside?
Cuz I’ve got a jet black heart    
And there’s a hurricane underneath it
Trying to keep us apart
I write with a poison pen
But these chemicals moving between us
Are the reason to start again
(Woah, woah)
  The blood in my veins is made up of mistakes
  Lets forget who we are and dive into the dark
  As we burst into color we turn into life
And there’s a hurricane underneath it
Trying to keep us apart
I write with a poison pen
But these chemicals moving between us
Are the reason to start again
The blood in my veins is made up of mistakes  (To start again!)
lets forget who we are and dive in…

But Father, you worked your will. 
I had no righteousness of my own 
I had no right to draw near your throne, 
But Father, you loved me still. 
And in love, before you laid the world’s foundation, 
You predestined to adopt me as your own. 
You have raised me up so high above my station; 
I’m a child of God by grace, and grace alone 
You left your home to seek out the lost; 
You knew the great and terrible cost 
But Jesus, your face was set. 
I worked my fingers down to the bone; 
Nothing I did could ever atone, 
Jesus, you paid my debt. 
By your blood I have redemption and salvation. 
Lord you died that I might reap what you have sown, 
And you rose that I might be a new creation. 
I am born again by grace, and grace alone. 
I was darkness all of my life, 
I never knew the day from the night, 
But Spirit, you made me see. 
I swore I knew the way on my own; 
Head full of rocks, a heart made of stone 
But Spirit, you moved in me. 
And At your touch my sleeping spirit was awakened; 
On my darkened heart the light of Christ has shone. 
Called into a kingdom that cannot shaken; 
Heaven’s citizen by grace, and grace alone. 
So I’ll stand in faith by grace, and grace alone 
I will run the race by grace, and grace alone 
I will slay my sin by grace, and grace alone 
I will reach the end by grace, and grace alone

Look at my face
All the stories it will tell I can't erase
The road is long
Just one more song
A little something to remind you when I'm gone
When I'm gone
The road to Hell
Along the way
Is paved with good intentions so they say
And some believe
That no good deed
That go unpunished in the end or so it seems
So when the day comes in
And the Sun won't touch my face
Tell the ones who cared enough
That I finally left this place
That's been so cold
Look at my face
All the stories it will tell I can't erase
The road is long
Just one more song
A little something to remind you when I'm gone
When I'm gone
So this is it
I say goodbye
To this chapter of my everchanging life
And there's mistakes
The path was long
And I'm sure I'll answer for them when I'm gone
When I'm gone

From the moment I first saw you I was yours and you were mine

And the echo of my mother's words, baby don't you play with fire
I was always playing the part
First love only set by a spark

Shouldn't have stood that close to the fire

Nowhere to hide, it's too late to say goodbye

Forced to watch the ashes floating, softly drifting to the ground

Because a vision softly creeping 
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence
In restless dreams I walked alone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light I saw
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence
Fools said I, you do not know
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach to you
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
And the sign flashed out it's warning
And the words that it was forming
The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls

 fallen from the sky    with grace
  into   your arms      race
  Lucid lovers me    and you
  a deal of matchless va - lue
 I was always quick to admit defeat
 empty statements of bones and meat
 And my heart it shook with fear
 I'm a coward behind a shield   and spear
 Take this sword and throw   it far
 Let it shine under the morning   star
  Who are you?   Who am I      to you?
  I am the antichrist    to you
 fallen from the sky    with grace
  into   your arms      race
 One for my heart and two for show
 three tears for all the souls   below
 One day we turned them into fi -   gurines
 burned them all with all my fa - vorite things

Bound up in shackles of all my failures

already been won”
I am redeemed, You set me free
So I’ll shake off these heavy chains
Wipe away every stain now I’m not who I used to be
I am redeemed                     I'm redeemed
All my life I have been called unworthy
Named by the voice of my shame and regret
But when I hear You whisper, “Child lift up your head”
I remember oh God, You’re not done with me yet
I am redeemed, You set me free
So I’ll shake off these heavy chains
Wipe away every stain now I’m not who I used to be   because
I don’t have to be the old man inside of me
Cause his day is long dead and gone        because
I’ve got a new name, a new life, I’m not the same
And a hope that will carry me home

Dressed up in silver and white with
Coloured old grey whistle test lights

Four stars out of fiveee and thats unheard of
Bridge and tunnel on the starlight express

Hokey cokey with the opposite sex

Too young to think about all that shit
And stalling only goes so far when you've got a head start
'Cause we could stay at home and watch the sunset

'Cause I could never rock like a Rolling Stone
I wonder how it feels to burn out young, yeah
'Cause I just wanna die before my heart fails
From heartbreak or cocktails and
Then maybe you'll cry once you know I'm gone
That's all I could ever want
'Cause I ain't scared of livin'
No, I ain't scared of livin'
No, I ain't scared of livin'
'Cause it's all we've got
What are we breathin' for if we ain't living?
And I don't want your love
I just wanna feel like I'm still livin'
And if there is no god
I know the day I die, I lived through heaven
And that I gave it hell
At least that's living
That's all I want
That's all I want
I tried being a writer but I hate what I write
You know, and every girl goes through a photography phase
You know, like horses, and taking dumb pictures of your feet

45,Beggin (ver 2),Måneskin,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/4160128,"I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'
Riding high when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, you won me then
But easy come and easy go and it would end
So, anytime I bleed, you let me go
Yah, anytime I feed, you get me know
Anytime I seek, you let me know
But I planted that seed, just let me grow
I'm on my knees when I'm beggin'
'Cause I don't wanna lose you
Hey, yeah, ra-ta-ta-ta!
'Cause I'm beggin', beggin' you
Uh, put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you, ah
And put your loving hand out, darlin'
I need you to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again
An empty shell, I used to be
A broken man that I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul
What we doin'? What we chasin'?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?
You're the wrong way track from the good
I want to paint a picture tellin' where we could be at
Like a heart in the best way should
You can give it away, you had it and you took the pay
But I keep walkin' on, keep openin' doors
Keep hopin' for, now the door is yours
Keep also home
'Cause I don't want to live in a broken home, girl, I'm beggin'
Mmm, yeah-yeah, yeah, I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'
I'm fighting hard to hold my own
Just can't make it all alone
I'm holding on, I can't fall back
I'm just a calm, 'bout to fade to black
I'm beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out

Pour a little salt we were never here
My my my - my my my - my my my my - my my ...
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My my my - my my my - my my my my - my my ...
Right in the moment this order's tall
I told you to be patient I told you to be fine
I told you to be balanced I told you to be kind
In the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines
Come on skinny love what happened here
Suckle on the hope in lite brassiere
My my my - my my my - my my my - my my ...
Sullen load is full so slow on the split
I told you to be patient I told you to be fine
I told you to be balanced I told you to be kind
Now all your love is wasted then who the hell was I?
Cause now I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines
Who will love you? who will fight?
And who will fall, far behind?
Come on skinny love ........

(piano in)
We are proud    individuals
  Living for the city
But the flames
Couldn't go much higher
We find  God     and religions
  To bait us with salvation
But no one, no nobody
Can give you the power
To rise
Over love
Over hate
Through this iron sky that's fast becoming our mind
Over fear and into freedom
Oh, that's life
That's dripping down the walls
Of a dream that cannot breathe
In this harsh reality
Mass confusion spoon fed to the blind
Serves now to define our cold society
From which we'll rise
Over love
Over hate
Through this iron sky that's fast becoming our mind
Over fear and into freedom
   You've just got to hold on
You've just got to hold on
And we'll rise
Over love
Over hate
Through this iron sky that's fast becoming our mind
Over fear and into freedom
Into freedom
From which we'll rise
Over love
Over hate
Through this iron sky that's fast becoming our mind
Over fear and into freedom
Freedom, freedom
Oh, rain on me
Rain on me
Rain on me

Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion 
But you are not the kind of boy 
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends 
And her snotty little family 
All dressed in pastel 
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room 
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
Thi--is i---is surely not 
What you thought it would be
I---I  lose myself in a daydream
Don't say ""Yes"", run away now
I'll meet you when you're out 
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow 
You need to hear me out
Fond gestures are exchanged 
And the organ starts to play a song 
That sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited 
By your lovely bride-to-be
She---e floats down the aisle 
Like a pageant queen 
But I--I kno--ow 
You wish it was me
Don't say ""Yes"", run away now
I'll meet you when you're out 
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow 
You need to hear me out
And they said ""Speak Now""
Don't say ""Yes"", run away now
I'll meet you when you're out 
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow 
Your time is running out
And they said ""Speak Now""
Ohooho laaaahhoh
Oooh (Say a single vow) ooohooh
I hear the preacher say speak now 
Or forever hold your pe---ace
There's a silence, there's my last chance 
I stand up with shaky hands 
All eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only lookin' at you
I am not the kind of girl 
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion 
But you are not the kind of boy 
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
 So don't say ""Yes"", run away now
I'll meet you when you're out 
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow 
You need to hear me out
They said ""Speak Now""
And you say ""Let's run away now""
I'll meet you when I'm out
Of my tux at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows
So glad you were around
When they said ""Speak no--ow""

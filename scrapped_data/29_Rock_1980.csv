She floats like a swan
Grace on the water
Lips like sugar
Lips like sugar
Just when you think you've caught her
She glides across the water
She calls for you tonight
To share this moonlight
You'll flow down her river
She'll ask you and you'll give her
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
She knows what she knows
I know what she's thinking
Sugar kisses  
Sugar kisses
Just when you think she's yours
She's flown to other shores
To laugh at how you break
And melt into this lake
You'll flow down her river
She'll ask you and you'll give her
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
She'll be my mirror
Reflect what I am
A loser and a winner
The king of Siam
And my Siamese twin
Alone on the river
Mirror kisses
Mirror kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses                                       
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses

À trop vouloir te regarder,
J'en oubliais les miennes
On rêvait de Venise et de liberté
J'aimerais quand même te dire
Tout ce que j'ai pu écrire
C'est ton sourire qui me l'a dicté.
Tu viendras longtemps marcher dans mes rêves
Tu viendras toujours du côté
Où le soleil se lève
Et si malgré ça j'arrive à t'oublier

2,Dont Give Up (ver 2),Peter Gabriel,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/peter-gabriel/dont-give-up-chords-1102148,"In this proud land we grew up strong
We were wanted all along
I was taught to fight, taught to win
I never thought I could fail
No fight left or so it seems
I am a man whose dreams have all deserted
I've changed my face, I've changed my name
But no one wants you when you lose
     Don't give up - 'cos you have friends
     Don't give up - you're not beaten yet
     Don't give up - I know you can make it good
Though I saw it all around
Never thought that I could be affected
Thought that we'd be last to go
It is so strange the way things turn
Drove the night toward my home
The place that I was born, on the lakeside
As daylight broke, I saw the earth
The trees had burned down to the ground
      Don't give up - you still have us
      Don't give up - we don't need much of anything
      Don't give up - 'cos somewhere there's a place where we belong
Rest your head
You worry too much
It's going to be alright
When times get rough, you can fall back on us, 
Don't give up,    please don't give up
Got to walk out of here, I can't take anymore
Gonna stand on that bridge, keep my eyes down below
Whatever may come and whatever may go,
That river's flowing,    that river's flowing
Moved on to another town
Tried hard to settle down
For every job, so many men
So many men no-one needs
     Don't give up - 'cos you have friends
     Don't give up - you're not the only one
     Don't give up - no reason to be ashamed
     Don't give up - you still have us
     Don't give up now - we're proud of who you are
     Don't give up - you know it's never been easy
     Don't give up - 'cos I believe there's a place
There's a place where we belong
Don't give up, don't give up ...

3,Here Comes The Flood (ver 2),Peter Gabriel,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/peter-gabriel/here-comes-the-flood-chords-1752502,"    When the night shows
    the signals grow on radios
    All the strange things
    they come and go, as early warnings
  Stranded starfish     have no place to hide
  still waiting for   the swollen      Easter tide
  There's no point in direction
  we can - not even choose a side.
    I took the old track
    the hollow shoulder, across the waters
    On the tall cliffs
    they were getting older, sons and daughters
  The jaded underworld         was riding high
  Waves of steel hurled metal      at the sky
  and as the nail sunk in the cloud,
  the rain  was warm and soaked the crowd.
Lord, here comes  the flood
We'll say goodbye  to flesh and blood
If again the seas are silent
in a - ny still alive
It   'll be those         who gave their is - land to  survive
Drink up,     dreamers, you're running dry.
    When the flood calls
    You have no home, you have no walls
    In the thun - der crash
    You're a thousand minds, within a flash
Don't be afraid to cry     at what you see
The actors gone, there's only you   and me
And if we break before the dawn,
they'll use   up  what we used to be.
Lord, here comes  the flood
We'll say goodbye  to flesh and blood
If again the seas are silent
in a - ny still alive
It   'll be those         who gave their is - land to  survive
Drink up,     dreamers, you're running dry.

Take me out tonight
because I want to see people and I want to see lights
Driving in your car oh please don't drop me home
because it's not my home, it's their home, and I'm welcome no more
And if a double-decker bus
crashes into us to die by your side
such a heavenly way to die
And if a ten ton truck
kills the both of us to die by your side

oh take me anywhere, I don't care

take me out tonight
oh take me anywhere, I don't care
Driving in your car I never never want to go home

And if a double-decker bus
crashes into us to die by your side

So I meet you at the cemetery gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
So I meet you at the cemetery gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
While Wilde is on mine
So we go inside and we gravely read the stones
All those people all those lives
Where are they now?
With loves, with hates
And passions just like mine
And then they lived
And then they died
And I want to cry
You say: ""ere thrice the sun hath door
Salutation to the dawn""
And you claim these words as your own
But I'm well read, have heard them said
A hundred times (maybe less, maybe more)
If you must write prose and poems
The words you use should be your own
Don't plagiarise or take on loan
There's always someone, somewhere
With a big nose, who knows
And who trips you up and laughs
When you fall
Who'll trip you up and laugh
When you fall
You say: ""ere long done do does did""
Words which could only be your own
You then produce the text
From whence was ripped
(some dizzy whore, 1804)
A dreaded sunny day
And I meet you at the cemetery gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side
A dreaded sunny day
And I meet you at the cemetery gates
Keats and Yeats are on your side - but you lose

          He just loved to live that way
          And he loved to take your money
         The old man spoke up in a bar
         Said i never been in prison
         A lifetime serving one ma-chine
         Is ten times worse than  prison
         Imagine if all the boys in jail
         Could now get out to-gether
         Whadda you think they'd want to say to us?
         While he was being clever
         Someday you'll meet your rocking chair
         'Cos that's where we're spinning
         There's no poiunt to wanna comb your hair
         When it's grey and thinning
         So we came to jazz it up,
         We never loved a shovel.
         Break your back to earn your pay,
         An' don't for-get to  grovel. Hey! 
         Get a-way, get away, get away, get away,
         Get away, get away, get away.
               Run rabbit run...
         I can't find that hole in the wall
         And i know that they never  will.

I know the girl sees things
Nobody else can see,
All of the secret fears inside
And all the craziness I hide
She looks into my soul
And reads me like nobody can
And she doesn't judge the man
She just takes me as I am
Come what may, she believes
And that faith is something
I've never known   before.
Come what may, she loves me
And that love has helped me open a door
Making me love myself a little  more
When I turn away
She knows those are the times
There's nothing she can say
Nothing that anyone can do
And so she lets me live it trough
And when I'm in my darkest hours of uncertaintly
She just simply lets me be
And goes right on loving me
..Making loving myself a little more
And when it seems my dreams
Have all slipped through my     fingers
When they just can't be found
I turn around and there they are
Shining in her eyes

Da gibt's gar nix, da brauch i net überlegen, heut muass i mir's wieder geben.
 Da führt ka Weg vorbei, alles andere is vollkommen egal
des is ma eh net neu, plötzlich bin i dann total sentimental,
und dann waß i, was i brauch und was i will, i brauch mei Überdosis G'fühl. 
 Dann muss i a paar alte Hadern hör'n, und muss zu de paar altern Hadern plärr'n.
 Rinnen muss das Schmalz, und i sag, Gott erhalt's, 
schenk mir no a Viertel ein, und denk was sein muss, des muss sein.
 Mit ""Long and Winding Road,"" da fang i an und bald bin I bei „Let it be“
Die Rührung und der Wein steign mir ins Hirn, jetz is ka Zeit mehr zu verlier'n
""Angie""  und ""If You Leave Me Now"", gleich bin i endgültig dran.
 So geht‘s bis viertel Viere in der Fruah, bald geht die Sunn auf, i hab no net g'nua.
 Die Straßn menschenleer, mei Kopf verraucht und schwer,
soviel Bilder, soviel G'schichten, soviel Schmerz und soviel Herz!
 Jetzt is es um mi g'scheh‘n, jetzt heb i ab, jetzt halt mi wirklich nix mehr auf
so is es halt im Leben, manchmal nimmt des Schicksal gnadenlos sein' Lauf.

48,Rock The Night,Europe,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/europe/rock-the-night-chords-67393,"  I've gone through changes
  I've gone through pain
  but there's not enough reason for me to go insane
  I know the feeling
  Just when it grows
  I'm in a rage up from my head down to my toes
  You know it ain't easy running out of thrills
  You know it ain't easy when you don't know what you want
  what do you want           Wohooo     you want to
  Rock now rock the night    'till early in the morning light
  Rock now rock the night  oh   oh
  Rock now rock the night  you better believe it's right
  Rock now rock the night  oh   oh       ohh

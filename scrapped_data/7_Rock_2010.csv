Tell me what you took, what you take

Tell me what you took, what you take
I think my fate is losing its patience
I think the ground is pulling me down
I think my life is losing momentum
I think my ways are wearing me down
I should move to a brand new city
Teach myself how to die

Wow, I look so weird here
My face has changed now
It's a big shame
So many feelings, struggling to leave my mouth
And it's not that rare for me to let myself down
In a big way
But I had enough time and I found enough reason to accept that
It's not the same anymore
I lost the joy in my face
My life was simple before
I should be happy, of course
But things just got much harder
Now it's just hard to ignore
It's not the same anymore
It's not the same anymore
It's not the same, but, it's not a shame 'cause
I spend a long time putting up with people
Putting on my best face
It's only normal when you stop things in the wrong way
It's only four o'clock and still, it's been a long day
I just wanna hit the hay
People knocking on me like every day
If only there could be another way
And when they want me the most
I'm tired of acting like I care, but I do
And I can't wait to hit the bed
'Cause it's not the same anymore
I lost the joy in my face
My life was simple before
I should be happy, of course (Of course)

I kept the feelings inside
I open up when shit gets built up this high
She makes it easy to cry
The words fall out of me and there's no more disguise
I miss the days when I was someone else
I used to be so hungry
Right now, my stomach's full as hell
And I've spent many months just hating on myself
I can't keep wishing things will be different
I wish I didn't need to get help
But I do
But I do
Oh-oh-oh
I been so hard on myself, yeah
Even my family can tell
And they barely saw what I felt
I wouldn't wish this on my enemy or anyone else
It's not the same
(It's not the same)
(It's not the same)
It's not the same as before
It's not the same anymore
I've learned so much from before
Now I'm not sure on advice
There's no excuses at all
No point in feeling upset
Won't take my place on the floor
I'll stand up straight like I'm tall
It's up to me, no one else
I'm doing this for myself
It's not the same anymore
It's better
It got better

And we're scouring the Alps and the Andes
And if they die then it is on my head
They follow paw prints in the snow to my throne, to my bed
You're pouting in your sleep, I'm waking still yawning
We're proving to each other that romance is boring
Sure there are things I could do if I was half prepared to
Prove to each other that romance is boring
Start as you mean to continue;
Complacent and self-involved
You're trying not to be nervous
If you were trying at all
I will wake, I will bake phallic cake
Take your diffidence, make it my clubhouse
But my strength's within lies, ventricle cauterized
It's the way of living that I espouse
You're pouting in your sleep, I'm waking still yawning
We're proving to each other that romance is boring
Sure there are things I could do if I was half prepared to
Prove to each other that romance is boring
We are two ships that pass in the night
You and I, we are nothing alike
I am a pleasure cruise, you are gone out to trawl
Return nets empty, nothing at all
You're pouting in your sleep, I'm waking still yawning
We're proving to each other that romance is boring
Sure there are things I could do if I was half prepared to
Prove to each other that romance is boring

Soon it will be over and buried with our past

Some days I don't know if I am wrong or right

No Happy ending.

We'll be ridin' on the horses, yeah yeah.
No woman, no cry,
It surely is a dream,

Once a jolly swagman, camped by a billabong.
Take on me,(When I come around)
Take Me On,(When I come around)

In a day or, two.
Save tonight,   (Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you.)
Fight the break of dawn.
Come tommorow,  (There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do.)
tommorow I'll be gone.
 I know she's playin with me,
 But thats okay 'cause I've got no self-esteem.
With a thousand eyes and a good disguise,
hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes.
'Cause I'm not here for your entertainment,
  you don't really wanna mess with me tonight.
 Cant read my, cant read my, no he can't read my,
poker face, come on Barbie lets go party.
Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me.
 She wants to touch me (woo-hoo),
She wants to love me (woo-hoo),
She'll never leave me (woo-hoo-oh-oh-oh).

Take your canvas bags, take your canvas bags,
Take your canvas bags, to the supermarket.
Take your canvas bags.
Nothings right I'm torn,
I'm all out of faith,
this is how I feel,
I'm cold and I am shamed,
lying naked on the floor.
Illusion never changed,
into something real,
I'm wide awake and I can see I'm more than a bird,
I'm more than a plane,
I'm a bird-plane,
I'm a bird-plane,
A mother fucking bird-plane.
Doesn't that sound familiar,
doesn't that sound too close to home
doesn't that make you shiver,
the way things could have gone.
And doesn't that seem peculiar,
'cause everyone wants a little more,
there's something I do remember,
to never go this far,
thats all it takes to be a star.

If just to shadow me through the night
Trace my steps through all my failure
And walk me out the other side

That valleyed hill called Calvary
But for the One I call Good Shepherd
Who like a lamb was slain for me

From a deep but empty grave

 You put your arm around me for the first time
 You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
 You are the best thing that's ever been mine
 Do you remember all the city lights on the water
 You saw me start to believe for the first time
 You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
 You are the best thing that's ever been mine
And I remember that fight, two thirty AM
You said everything was slipping out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
   Braced myself for the goodbye
   'Cause that's all I've ever known
   And you took me by suprise
   You said I'll never leave you alone
 I remember how we felt sitting by the water
 And every time I look at you it's like the first time
 I fell in love with a careless man’s careful daughter
 She is the best thing that’s ever been mine
Hold on, we can make it last
Hold on, never turn back
 You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
 You are the best thing that's ever been mine
(Hold on) Do you believe it?
(Hold on) We’re gonna make it now
(Hold on) And I can see it
Yeah, yeah (I can see it now, see it now, see it now)
 The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
 And I'm a house of cards
 You're the kind of reckless that should send me running
 But I kinda know that I won't get far
 And you stood there in front of me just
 Close enough to touch
 Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinking of
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
 My mind forgets to remind me
 You're a bad idea
 You touch me once and it's really something
 You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
 I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
 But with you I know it's no good
 And I could wait patiently but
 I really wish you would
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
I run my fingers through your hair
And watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
I'm captivated by you baby like a fireworks show
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
And the sparks fly, baby smile, and the sparks fly
I'm so glad you made the time to see me
How's life, tell me how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
You're guard is up, and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
It's still burned in the back of your mind 
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride 
Standing in front of you saying 
""I'm sorry for that night"" and I go 
Back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't
Nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had 
When you were mine 
I'd go back to December, 
Turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time
These days I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer all the beautiful times 
I watch you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and
All I gave you was goodbye
So this is me swallowing my pride 
Standing in front of you saying 
""I'm sorry for that night"" and I go 
Back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't
Nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had 
When you were mine 
I'd go back to December, 
Turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
I miss your tan skin your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms
That September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
If you loved again I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door I understand
But this is me swallowing my pride 
Standing in front of you saying 
""I'm sorry for that night"" and I go 
Back to December...
It turns out freedom ain't
Nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had 
When you were mine 
I'd go back to December 
Turn around and make it all right
I'd go back to December
Turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
        All the time
I am not the kind of girl 
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion 
But you are not the kind of boy 
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends 
And her snotty little family 
All dressed in pastel 
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room 
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
Thi--is i---is surely not 
What you thought it would be
I---I  lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say
Don't say ""Yes"" run away now
I'll meet you when your out 
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow 
You need to hear me out
And they said ""Speak Now""
Fond gestures are exchanged 
And the organ starts to play a song 
That sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited 
By your lovely bride-to-be
She---e floats down the aisle 
Like a pageant queen 
But I--I kno--ow 
You wish it was me
You wish it was me- Don't you?
Don't say ""Yes"" run away now
I'll meet you when your out 
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow 
You need to hear me out
And they said ""Speak Now""
Don't say ""Yes"" run away now
I'll meet you when your out 
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow 
Your time is running out
And they said ""Speak Now""
Ohooho laaaahhoh
Oooh(Say you see me now)ooohooh
I hear the preacher say speak now 
Or forever hold your pe---ace
There's a silence, there's my last chance 
I stand up with shaky hands 
All eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only lookin' at you
I am not the kind of girl 
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion 
But you are not the kind of boy 
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
Oops! Don't say ""Yes"" run away now
I'll meet you when your out 
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow 
You need to hear me out
They said ""Speak Now""
And you say ""Lets run away now""
I'll meet you when I'm out
Of my tux at the back door
Baby I didn't say my vows
So glad you were around
When they said ""Speak no--ow""
Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps, prayin' the floor won't fall through, again
My mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky and go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game but you changed the rules every day
Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight.
Well I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home.
I shoulda known.
Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame.
Maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away.
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand.
And I'll look back in regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can.""
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home.
Dear John, I see it all now it was wrong.
Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played by your dark twisted games 
When I loved you so?
I shoulda known.
You are an expert at sorry
And keeping lines blurry
And never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you run dry
Have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home.
    I see it all now that you're gone.
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song.
You shoulda known.
You shoulda known.
     Don't you think I was too young?
You shoulda known.
You, with your words like knives and swords
And weapons that you use against me 
You, have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feelin' like a nothin'
You, with your voice like nails on a chalk board
Callin' me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man
Well you can take me down with just one single blow
But you don't know, what you don't know...
Someday I'll be livin in a big ol' city 
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me 
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
You, with your swithching sides and
Your wild fire lies and your humiliation
You, have pointed out my flaws again
I walk with my head down
tryin' to block you out 
'cause I never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you  cold
But the cycle ends right now 'cause
You can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know
Someday I'll be livin in a big ol' city 
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me 
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
And I can't see you years from now in a bar
 Talkin' over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But no one's listening
Washed up and ranting about the 
same old   bitter   things
Drunk and grumblin' all about how I  can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean...and a liar...and pathetic
And alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean
But someday I'll be livin in a big ol' city 
And all you're ever gonna be is mean,  yeah--ah
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me 
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so...Someday
I'll be livin in a big ol' city (why ya gotta be so mean)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean (why ya gotta be so mean)
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me (why ya gotta be so mean)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so  mean?
I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
People would say, ""They're the lucky ones""
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fall out
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up I can't break through
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you
Like it's killing me?
I don't know what to say since a twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now-  Next chapter
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes
And trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should have held me
Oh, we're scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you
Like it's killing me?
I don't know what to say since a twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
    This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you'd say you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon
  Now I'm standing alone 
      In a crowded room  and we're not speaking                    
And I'm dying to know is it killing you
Like it's killing me?
I don't know what to say since a twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us 
Looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, no-----ow
   And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you
Like it's killing me?
I don't know what to say since a twist of fate
'Cause we're go-ing down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Your little hands wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids 
Flutter cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in 
Turn on your favorite night light
To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have honey
If you could stay like that
Oohhh darling don't you ever grow up, 
Don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Ohh darling don't you ever grow up, 
Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Wont let no one break your heart
No one will desert you
Just try to never grow up
Never grow up
You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out
Someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance 
Around in your PJs getting ready for school
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, 
Don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, 
Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
And no one's ever burned you
Nothin's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood rooOOoom
Memorize what is sounded like what your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I had is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up
Ohhh, I don't want to grow up
Wish I'd never grown up
Could still be little
Ooohh I don't want to grow up 
Wish I'd never grown up 
It could still be simple
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, 
Don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, 
Don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
Ooooh, I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want too
Please try to never grow up
Ohhhohoh,ohhoh, don't you ever grow up
Ohhhoh,(never grow up) just never grow up
There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity Shifiting eyes and vancancy 
vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered ""have we met?""
Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me
The playful conversation starts Counter all your quick remarks 
like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
 This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
The lingering question kept me up 2am, who do you love?
I wonder till I'm wide awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say,
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you
 This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
 This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
I was enchanted to meet you
This is me praying that this was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name until I see you again
These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
 This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
 This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you know
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
The story starts when it was hot and it was Summer
And, I had it all; I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say sabotage
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum 
She underestimated just who she was stealing from 
She's not a saint and she's not what you think 
She's an actress, Whoa
She's better known for the things that she does 
on the mattress, Whoa
Soon she's gonna find 
Stealing other people's toys on the playground 
Won't make you many friends 
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind 
There is nothing I do better than revenge, Ha 
She lives her life like it's a party and she's on the list 
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it 
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling 
And, she thinks I'm psycho cause I like to rhyme her name with things, but 
Sophistication isn't what you wear, or who you know 
or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go 
Oh they didn't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me 
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity 
She's not a saint and she's not what you think 
She's an actress, Whoa
She's better known for the things that she does 
on the mattress, Whoa
Soon she's gonna find 
Stealing other people's toys on the playground 
Won't make you many friends 
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind 
There is nothing I do better than revenge, Ha ha
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey 
You might have him, but haven't you heard 
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word     Whoa
She's not a saint and she's not what you think 
She's an actress, Whoa
She's better known for the things that she does 
on the mattress, Whoa
Soon she's gonna find 
Stealing other people's toys on the playground 
Won't make you many friends 
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind 
There is nothing I do better than revenge
And do you still feel like you know what you're doing, 
Cause I don't think you do, Oh 
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing 
I don't think you do, I don't think you do 
Let's hear the applause 
C'mon show me how much better you are 
See you deserve some applause 
Cause you're so much better 
She took him faster than you can say sabotage
   I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back
Wasn't it easi--er in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed, to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
  And everybody believed in you
 It's alright, just wait and see your,
String of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not what you've been, 
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent
  Did some things you can't speak of
But tonight you'll live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then
Wasn't it easi--er in your firefly catching days?
And everything out of reach 
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'till you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you
 It's alright just wait and see your,
String of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not what you've been,  
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd,  
Thirty-two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did,  
You're still an innocent 
Time turns flames to embers, 
You'll have new September's
Everyone of us has messed up too, ooh
Lines change like the weather, 
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to.. 
Be brand newww..,  Oohohohoh
 It's alright, just wait and see your,
String of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not what you've been,  
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd,  
Thirty-two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did,  
You're still an innocent 
You're still an innocent
Lost your Balance on a tightrope, ohoh
It's never too late to get it back
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all so quiet and I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake
Oh, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now
Stood there and watched you walk away from everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain and he just might make me smile
But the whole time I'm wishing he was you instead
Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now
I know
I know
I just know
You're not gone
You can't be gone
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
I can't go back
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd see it break
I still remember the look on your face,
Lit through the darkness at 1:58,
The words that you whispered for just us to know.
You told me you loved me so why did you go 
Away?
Away.
I do recall now the smell of the rain,
Fresh on the pavement. I ran off the plane.
That July 9th, the beat of your heart.
It jumps through your shirt. I can still feel your arms.
But now I'll go sit on the floor,
Wearing your clothes.
All that I know is I don't know.
How to be something you miss.
I never thought we'd have a last kiss.
Never imagined we'd end like this.
Your name forever the name on my lips.
I do remember the swing in your step.
The life of the party, you're showing off again.
And I roll my eyes and then you pull me in.
I'm not much for dancin', but for you I did.
Because I love your handshake, meetin' my father.
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets.
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of sayin' something.
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions.
And I'll go sit on the floor,
Wearing your clothes.
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss.
I never thought we'd have a last kiss.
Never imagined we'd end like this.
Your name forever the name on my lips.
Oo-oo-ooh.
So I'll watch your life in pictures
Like I used to watch you sleep
And I'll feel you forget me
Like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends
Just to ask them how you are.
Hope it's nice where you are.
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed.
You can plan for a change in the weather in town,
but I never planned on you changing your mind.
So I'll go sit on the floor,
Wearing your clothes.
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss.
I never thought we'd have a last kiss.
Never imagined we'd end like this.
Your name forever the name on my lips.
Just like our last kiss.
Forever the name on my lips.
Forever the name on my lips.
Just like our last.
I say remember this moment In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild 
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names 
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero On a history book page
It was the end of a decade But the start of an age
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered
I said remember this feeling I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged Screaming, ""this is absurd""
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in 
ripped up jeans got to rule the world
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""long live the look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
And you take a moment
Promise me this:
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you
Long,long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
long live the look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high
The waters rough
But this love is ours
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, cause right now you're mine
And you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high
The waters rough
But this love is ours
And it's not theirs to speculate
If it's wrong and your hands are tough but they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
Cause my heart is yours
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high
The waters rough
But this love is ours
Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories baby
Thinkin bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you
Come back, come back, come back to me-e like
You would, you would, if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me-e like
You could, you could, if you just said ""You're sorry""
I know that we can work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall
Chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
Nothings gonna change not for me and you
Not before I knew how much I had to lose
Come back, come back, come back to me-e like
You would, you would, if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me-e like
You could, you could, if you just said ""You're sorry""
I know that we can work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
  If you're out there if you're 
Somewhere if you're moving on
I've be waiting for you 
Ever since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just wanna see you back at my  front door
Come back, come back, come back to me-e like
You would, before, you said it's not that easy
Before the fight before I locked you out
But I'd take it all back now
Come back, come back, come back to me-e like
You would, you would, if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me-e like
You could, you could, if you just said ""You're sorry""
I know that we can work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now
You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby what about the ending, Oh
I thought you'd be here by noow ohhoohhohhohh
 That you'd be here by now
Tall dark and Superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
Its the same thing to me
He's got his mothers eyes his fathers ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you sa--ay
And, you'll smile and say how are you
I'll say just fine
I always forget to tell you, I love you, I love you ... forever!
I watch Superman fly away 
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world I'll be around
And I watch Superman fly away
Come back I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down
Talk dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yea--ah
Something in his deep browns eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation and
I can't hear one single word they saa--ay
And you'll leave got places to be and I'll be o-kay
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day
I watch Superman fly away 
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world I'll be around
And I watch Superman fly away
Come back I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down
And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't take some other girl
Don't forget! Don't forget! About me!
I'm far away but I never let you go
I'm lovestruck and looking out the window
Don't forget! Don't forget! Where I'll be!
Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you
'Cause I loved you from the very first day
I watch Superman fly away 
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world I'll be around, forever and ever!
I watch Superman fly away
I swear I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down   
 La, la, la, la, la, la, when you come back down

45,Thank You (ver 2),Chris Cornell,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/chris-cornell/thank-you-chords-507903,"If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you.
When mountains crumble to the sea, there will still be you and me.
Kind woman, I give you my all, Kind woman, nothing more.
Little drops of rain whisper of the pain, tears of loves lost in the days gone by.
Our love is strong, with you there is no wrong, together we shall go until we die.
An inspiration is what you are to me, inspiration, look and see.
And so today, my world it smiles, your hand in mine, we walk the miles,
Thanks to you it will be done, for you to me are the only one.
Happiness, no more be sad, happiness....I am glad.
Little drops of rain whisper of the pain, tears of loves lost in the days gone by.
Our love is strong, with you there is no wrong, together we shall go until we die.
An inspiration is what you are to me, inspiration, look and see.
If the sun refused to shine, I would still be loving you.
When mountains crumble to the sea, there will still be you and me.
ooooh       ooooh    hooooh

oooooh      oooooh   ooh ooh

My friends are in the bathroom
my lover she's waiting for me
My seats been taken by some sunglasses
asking 'bout a scar
and I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're trying to forget
but between the drinks and subtle things
you know I'm trying hard to take it back
so if by the time the bar closes
and you feel like falling down
I'll carry you home 
Tonight
We are young
So let's set the world on fire
than the sun
Carry me home tonight
Just carry me home tonight
Carry me home tonight
Just carry me home tonight

I’ve cheated and I’ve lied
I’ve fallen down from grace 
A few too many times
But I find holy redemption
When I put this car in drive
Roll the windows down and turn up the dial
Can I get a hallelujah
  Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singing every single verse
Yeah I guess that’s my church
When Hank brings the sermon
  And Cash leads the choir
It gets my cold cold heart burning
Hotter than a ring of fire
When this wonderful world gets heavy
And I need to find my escape
I just keep the wheels rolling, radio scrolling
Until my sins wash away
Can I get a hallelujah
  Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singing every single verse
Yeah I guess that’s my church
Can I get a hallelujah
  Can I get an amen
Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singing every single verse
Yeah I guess that’s my church
Can I get a hallelujah
  Can I get an amen

When I play the highway FM
I find my soul revival
Singing every single verse

But I'm not finished   'cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leaving, carrying your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreaming  of bumping into you
          Now it's three in the morning 
And I'm trying to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply
       Why'd you only call me when you're high? 
High,  why'd you only call me when you're high?
Somewhere darker, talking the same shite
I need a partner,   well  are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen, more I get through the gears
Incapable of making alright decisions and having bad ideas
          Now it's three in the morning 
And I'm trying to change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply

  With abandon in their eyes
  But in our bedroom we're bloodshot and beat
  And never so alive
  And I know what's on your mi-i-ind
God knows I put it the-e-ere
But if I took it ba-a-a-ck
Well you'd be nowhere
You'd be nowhere again
  Now look at you all torn up
  I left you waiting to bleed
  I guess the truth works two ways
  Maybe the truth's not what we need
  And I know what's on your mi-i-ind
God knows I put it the-e-ere
But if I took it ba-a-a-ck
Well you'd be nowhere
You'd be nowhere again
  But in my cold arms
You don't sleep
In my cold arms
Your fear beats
In my cold arms
You stay

This way you won't        force me to proceed

Fuck it if they try and get to us

Than let you down.

 Or how we survived so long
 'Till you set fire to my atmosphere
 And I remember how I spent the 23rd
 When I'm thirty thousand feet in the air
 Chasing that sundown
 Feeling like the edge of this world is near
 But you'll feel better when you wake up

 This is more than just a phase, love
 And even though it seems like half the world away
 Things will be better in America

 Stay, you're not gonna leave me
 This place is right where you need to be
 And why your words gotta mean so much to them
 So stay, you're not what you're hearing
 'Cause I've been watching you changing
 And who said you're one in a million
 Cause you see only what you want to
 Your tunnel vision haunts you
 When you keep sleeping through the PM
 You’re sleepwalking, just keep talking
 And maybe you can talk your way out of this deep end
 Just tell me what you're thinking
 I'm scared that you might fall
 But you're not
 And you'll feel better when you wake up

 And it's always shining somewhere

Just a little hush, babe
Our veins are busy but my heart's in atrophy
Any way to distract and sedate
Adding shadows to the walls of the cave
You and I nursing on a poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
Some whiff of this death and guts
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we can feel none of it
Something isn't right, babe
I keep catching the words but the meaning's thin    
I'm somewhere outside my life, babe

So we're slaves to any sEmblance of touch
Lord we should quit but we love it too much
Sedated we're nursing on a poison that never stung

And heaven knows a place somewhere for the misunderstood
You know I'd give you blood if it'd be enough
Devil's on my doorstep since the day I was born
It's hard to find a sunset in the eye of a storm
But I'm a dreamer by design and I know in time
We'll put this behind
For what it's worth I'm sorry for the hurt
I'll be the first to say, I made my own mistakes
For what it's worth I know it's just a word
And words betray
Sometimes we lose our way
For what it's worth
Behind the lens is a poisoned picture you paint
And let's not pretend you were ever searching for saints
Cos I've been crucified for just being alive
Somewhere in the crossfire of this whispering war
Seems like I forgot just what I was fighting for
But underneath my skin there's a fire within
Still burning
For what it's worth I'm sorry for the hurt
I'll be the first to say I made my own mistakes
For what it's worth I know it's just a word
And words betray
Sometimes we lose our way
For what it's worth
The first bird to fly gets all the arrows
Let's leave the past behind with all our sorrows
I'll build a bridge between us and I'll swallow my pride
For what it's worth I'm sorry for the hurt
I'll be the first to say I made my own mistakes
For what it's worth I know it's just a word

When you concentrate enough

Every touch is a redefined phrase

Inside my workshop behind the old arcade
Electric desires
Had unraveled all my wires
Now I'm in the box for safekeeping
The news reporters reported that I died
But all my organs were living on inside
Circuit board to brain
With two lungs collecting change
One big human heart gently beeping
You can't win me, I can't be beat
I won't hurt you, unless you cheat
You can't see me behind the screen
I'm half human and half machine
Thank God for business, they let me take the floor
I stood so proudly, like I was going to war
Players soon appeared, and I quickly was revered
This must be what love would have felt like
Such dedication, they came from miles away
With eyes so piercing, they'd wait their turn to play
Perfect patient lines, because I was in their minds
I could do whatever I felt like (Whatever I felt like)
You can't win me, I can't be beat
I won't hurt you, unless you cheat
You can't see me behind the screen
I'm half human and half machine
I'm happy for years and years
And only eaten the occasional maintenance man
Only driving a few kids to madness
Maybe they were predisposed to madness, who knows?
I only want to have fun
But now they're telling me my days here are done
Cause there's a little tiny box they make in Japan
And pretty soon it's gonna fit in your hand
It's getting lonely, it's getting hard to breathe
The arcade's empty, I think it's Christmas Eve
Someone's broken in, now they're painting on my skin
Breaking me and taking my quarters
Bashing in my face with a crowbar
Kicking me and pushing me over
Now they see my blood on their sneakers
You can't win me, I can't be beat
I won't hurt you, unless you cheat

Leaving my child behind
Now, I suffer the curse and now, I am blind
With all this anger, guilt and sadness
Coming to haunt me forever
I can't wait for the cliff at the end of the river
Is this revenge I am seeking
Or seeking someone to avenge me?
Stuck in my own paradox, I wanna set myself free
Maybe, I should chase and find
Before they'll try to stop it
It won't be long before I'll become a puppet
It's been so long
Since I seen my son
Lost to this monster
To the man behind the slaughter
Since you've been gone
I've been singing this stupid song
So, I could ponder
The sanity of your mother
I wish I lived in the present
With the gift of my past mistakes
But the future keeps luring in like a pack of snakes
Your sweet little eyes, your little smile is all I remember
Those fuzzy memories mess with my temper
Justification is killing me but killing isn't justified
What happened to my son? I'm terrified
It lingers in my mind and the thought keeps on getting on bigger
I'm sorry, my sweet baby, I wish I'd been there

To the man behind the slaughter

46,A Million Dreams,P!nk,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/pnk/a-million-dreams-chords-2518794,"I close my eyes and I can see
A world that's waiting up for me that I call my own
Through the dark, through the door
Through where no one's been before
But it feels like home
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say I've lost my mind
I don't care, I don't care, if they call me crazy
We can live in a world that we design
'Cause every night, I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
There's a house we can build
Every room inside is filled with things from far away
Special things I compile
Each one there to make you smile on a rainy day
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy
They can say, they can say we've lost our minds
See I don't care, I don't care, if they call us crazy
Run away to a world that we design
'Cause every night, I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
However big, however    small
Let me be part of it all
Share your dreams with me
We may be right, we may be wrong
But I wanna bring you along to the world I see
To the world we close our eyes to see
We close our eyes to see
'Cause every night, I lie in bed
The brightest colors fill my head
A million dreams are keeping me awake
I think of what the world could be
A vision of the one I see
A million dreams is all it's gonna take
A million dreams for the world we're gonna m--a---ke
For the world we're gonna make

47,I Always Wanna Die Sometimes,The 1975,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-1975/i-always-wanna-die-sometimes-chords-2530971,"I bet you thought your life would change
But you're sat on a train again
Your memories are sceneries for things you said
But never really meant
You build it to a high to say goodbye
Because you're not the same as them
But your death it won't happen to you
It happens to your family and your friends
I pretend
And I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die, sometimes
You win, you lose, you sing the blues
There's no point in buying concrete shoes
And I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die
Am I me through geography?
I can hardly speak
And when I try it's nothing but a squeak
On the video
Living room for small
If you can't survive; just try
And I always wanna die, sometimes
I always wanna die, sometimes
Always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die
And I always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die
Always wanna die, sometimes
Sometimes... Sometimes...
I... Sometimes...
Always wanna die
Always wanna die, sometimes

I sold my soul, I'm waiting for my pay in full
I only want, your dying love, I've seen enough
      I tried but, I don't think so, maybe it was me who was fucking up
I gave all I could give but, it seems like it never really was enough
I feel left out, I don't see how
My whole life can change in one week
I don't mind my own reflection
I don't see how, you've been let down
Don't speak unless you have to
Why you always seem in a bad mood?
Your whole life you had an attitude
One day, is this so bad for you?
I'm sorry if I hurt you, I'm sorry if it got that bad
I'm sorry I can't help you, somebody should've had your back
      I tried but, I don't think so, maybe it was me who was fucking up
I gave all I could give but, it seems like it never really was enough
I changed my, whole life when
I learned to, ignore them
I changed my, whole life up
Maybe it was not enough
I don't think I'm allowed to
Make a deal with your selfish ways
They're acting vicious out there
There's lots of demons out here
I'm sorry if I hurt you, I'm sorry if it got that bad
I'm sorry I can't help you, somebody should've had your back

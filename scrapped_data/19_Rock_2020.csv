Slippin' through dreamland like a tourist
Pullin' down backstreets, deep in your head
Slippin' through dreamland like a tourist
That first friend you had, that worst thing you said
That perfect moment, that last tear you shed
All you've done in bed, all on Memorex
All round round your head, all round round your head
Pullin' down backstreets, deep in your head
Slippin through dreamland like a tourist
Pullin' down backstreets, deep in your head
Slippin' through dreamland like a tourist
You've had too much of the digital love
You want everything live, you want things you can touch
Make it feel like a movie you saw in your youth
Make it feel like that song that just unopened you
You were ten years old, holdin' hands in the classroom
He had a gun on the first day of high school
You want something bizarre, old conceptual cars
You want girls dressed in drag, you want boys with guitars
Pullin' down backstreets, deep in your head
Slippin' through dreamland like a tourist
Pullin' down backstreets, deep in your head
Slippin' through dreamland like a tourist
You see in Kodachrome, you see pink and gold
You see Mulholland glow, you see in airplane mode
All round round your head, all round round your head
All round round your head, all round round your head
You float in the pool where the soundtrack is canned
You go ask your questions like, ""What makes a man?""
Oh, it's 2020, so it's time to change that
So you go make an album and call it Dreamland

1,Seasons,NEEDTOBREATHE,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/needtobreathe/seasons-chords-3131018,"We can’t decide if we are fallen
Because every single call is a chance
To realize we’re dependent
On the fate of our circumstance
We’ve been living minute to minute
We’ve been holding on to every breath
Somehow our hearts are still in it
But our innocence has left
We’re in for nasty weather
And I’ll ride it out with you
We won’t be riding highs and lows
Like tides of ocean blue
We won’t be here forever
Just a moment then we’re through
We can’t be shifting with the sands
Like seasons always do
Like seasons always do
Everything we said was a reason
For us to pick up our things and go
But even when we climbed up the mountain
We knew that we had nowhere to go
We’re in for nasty weather
And I’ll ride it out with you
We won’t be riding highs and lows
Like tides of ocean blue
We won’t be here forever
Just a moment then we’re through
We can’t be shifting with the sands
Like seasons always do
I was in, I was in perpetual
anticipation
I never knew what was worse
The evil I, the evil I had spent my time
Reliving all of the worrying that made it hurt
I am done, I am done with waiting on
the creek to rise
Cause there’s more to life, there’s more to life
There’s more to life
We’re in for nasty weather
And I’ll ride it out with you

If silence is the voice of a new generation
Then I could live up to all of your expectations

Anxious more often than lookin alive.
Stoned more than feeling.
Drunk more than sleeping.
Too loud in Sweden, they turned off the lights.
Can I take a piece of you
swerving through mountains
after the night shift?
Pull off in traffic and let me outside.
Carelessly plant it
Sleep mask and wishing,
“Turn into something, don’t let it die.”
Can I take a piece of you ‘cross the state line
like the rhythm steals my body
like the summer steals my mind?
The feeling that follows you from a past life,
when you lose it in a moment
can you tell yourself it’s fine?
Pictures of toilets across the planet.
Stuff this in your pocket and wait in the line to
trade it for chocolates, cough drops, some weird chips, coffee or something.
I don’t have the time.

La sua faccia mentre guida
E la sua musica leggera
Tu che fai la scema

Hai messo il rossetto, sembrava come sangue sulle labbra
E tutti questi sassi nelle scarpe sono diventati sabbia
Perché sto in giro a cercarti da una notte intera
Chi ti ama ti segua, ma a te nemmeno te ne frega

La sua giacca e la camicia
Il tuo abito da sera

Sigarette come caramelle
Una dietro l’altra
Lei neanche mi guarda
Prima ti cercavo, adesso ti evito
Tornerò da solo come sempre
Con la faccia bianca
E il cuore che non batte più

 Without a river in sight
Fingers crossed
Throughout the night
  Head underwater
 You can hear the sound
 What you've been feeling now
 Won't stick around
 And all of this time I spend just getting by
 Sometimes forget to wonder why
 Lately in another time
The sound's not quite the same
 I'm waking in a new place
Without need for all these names
 Maybe these lines on my skin
 Will one day answer the questions I'm asking
 But for now I'll keep an eye
 On the water reflecting the open sky

È solo perché non mi fido
Perché è sempre meglio ferire
Prima di essere ferito
Tiro da 3 con il mio cuore
Faccio canestro in un cestino
Ho voglia solo di restare in giro
Slegare il filo che mi tiene unito
Pensavo fosse primavera
Ma sono uscito e sento ancora il gelo
Speravo che stare da soli almeno
Servisse a non farci sentire il peso
Pensavo di saper nuotare
Ma per un pelo quasi non annego
Giuro, volevo bere un po' di meno
Però ho ancora il bicchiere pieno
Tutti i giorni come il venerdì, uh-uh-uh
No, non posso vivere così (Uh-uh-uh)
Mi han messo la droga nel bicchiere o sono io così
Che non riesco più a fermarmi? Uh-uh-uh

Che non riesco più a fermarmi? Uh-uh-uh
Mando giù un drink e sa di candeggina
Lo sento sciogliere i nodi alla gola
Se dopo questo ce n'è un altro ancora
Mi perderò come i vestiti tra le tue lenzuola
Tiro da 3 con il mio cuore
Non ti ho più vista come finite le scuole
Ti ho fissa in testa tipo i cerchi in hangover
Non riesco più a levarti come gomme dalle suole
Alzo il volume più che posso
Per non sentire il fastidio
Per fare pace con il mondo intero
Slegare il filo che mi tira indietro
Ma io stasera sento ancora il gelo
Speravo che starmene fuori almeno
Mi bastasse per distrarmi
E non pensarci più
Tutti i giorni come il venerdì, uh-uh-uh
No, non posso vivere così (Uh-uh-uh)
Mi han messo la droga nel bicchiere o sono io così
Che non riesco più a fermarmi? Uh-uh-uh
Tutti i giorni come il venerdì, uh-uh-uh
No, non posso vivere così (Uh-uh-uh)
Mi han messo la droga nel bicchiere o sono io così
Che non riesco più a fermarmi? Uh-uh-uh

O forse esco soltanto perché spero che accada
E se tutto è finito, è perché non era cosa

No shame at all in being such a filthy frigid Lysol-huffing whore

My words will sink into the sea
And I will know for a split second that
My whole life's ceased to be
The morning I woke up to leave there
As soon as I opened my eyes
It hurt so bad that I could taste it
So cold it burned all my insides
I've never felt anything like it
Heard my lungs scream like that before
Felt such a tear in my aorta
That it spilled all of the light I ever saw
Across the floor
I couldn't wrap my head around it
How such a nightmare could be real
And despite all of my bullshit
Nothing could stop it
Not God, not sex
And there's no shame in sleeping later
No shame at all in sleeping more
None at all in being such a goddamn filthy Clorox-huffing whore

 Always kept time in my back pocket

 Shut the door, then lock it
And where have all of my friends gone
And where did all of my friends go
And where have all of my friends gone

 Thought that I saw Jessi, then I got to feeling proud
To ever have known someone so pretty and so sweet
Who every-time she sang a song it'd sweep me off me feet
But oh my my, oh I guess
That she did her time, now she's laid to rest
There’s a campfire inside her soul
Still billows
I walked to town, devil one side of me
Held by an angel put poems inside of me
Down to my mouth said won’t you recite to me, okay
Every first Wednesday there goes that sound again
Sun’s going down and she's a sundowner
Stay calm, stay calm, and give me your palm
Give me your palm, and I’ll sing you a song
Young kids smoke cigarettes out on the avenue
Sun’s going down so you might as well have a few
Hey who are you? Did you hear the news?
Anthony's dead, and Poor Richard too
They billow, they billow, and it makes me nervous
They whittled a fiddle from wood in our service
Now that it’s dusk, kids scatter the avenue
Hey who are you? I'm a sundowner too

And my worst old times look fine from here
I know you walked this route
And you might help me out
You said what's done is done
I can't turn the hand 'round
But still it looks a long way down
Oh man, was it that much better then?
We were left alone, we were proud of our pain
And so I want to walk out in the night
See the wide young river flood rain
We're not on one straight line
I made my own way through
And when the track goes cold
I'll know that it's true
That rebirth won't work like it used to
Oh man, was it that much better then?
We were left alone, we were proud of our pain
And so I want to walk out in the night
See the wide young river flood rain
And I can't let go
Of a lot I've left
But what I kept
Each passing step
And you read the writ
Is it not worth it?
I inherited this and I'm overcome
That's that, we're a long way from the past

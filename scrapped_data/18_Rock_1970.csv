Though he's bathed in sweat he hasn't lost his style

Me, I'm just another face at Zanzibar
But the waitress always serves a secret smile   Whoa...
She's waiting out in Shantytown
She's gonna pull the curtains down for me,      for me
   I've got the old man's car,
I've got a jazz guitar
I've got a tab at Zan -- zi -- bar

Rose, he knows he's such a credit to the game,
But the Yankees grab the headlines every time
    Melodrama's so much fun
    In black and white for everyone to see     whoa
Me, I'm trying just to get to second base
And I'd steal it if she only gave the sign     whoa

My old man is another child that's grown old.
If dreams were thunder and lightning was desire
this old house would've burnt down a long time ago.
Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery.
Make me a poster of an old rodeo.
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to.
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go.
When I was a young girl I had me a cowboy,
wasn't much to look at, just a free ramblin' man.
But that was a long time, and no matter how I try,
the years just flow by like a broken-down dam.
Make me an angel that flies from Montgomery.
Make me a poster of an old rodeo.
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to.
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go.
There's flies in the kitchen, I can hear all their buzzin'
but I ain't done nothin' since I woke up today.
How the hell can a person go to work in the morning
And come home in the evenin' and have nothin' to say.

 Federico Lorca is dead and gone
Bullet holes in the cemetery walls
 The black cars of the Guardia Civil

Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
 Yo te acuerda, oh mi corazón.
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito

Spanish weeks in my disco casino
 The freedom fighters died upon the hill
They sang the red flag, they wore the black one
But after they died it was Mockingbird Hill
Back home the buses went up in flashes
 The Irish tomb was drenched in blood
Spanish bombs shatter the hotels
 My señorita's rose was nipped in the bud
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
 Yo te acuerda, oh mi corazón.
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
 Yo te acuerda, oh mi corazón.

Fixin' bayonets to fight the other line

Although you were surrounded by beauty unbounded
Your glance was intended for me
And though I tried to hide it I found myself looking to see you
So then you took your chances, you made your advances
Your touch took my breath away
But when you said hello, are you ready to go
Well I had just one thing to say
If you can't give me love Honey, that ain’t enough
Let me go look for somebody else
If you can't give me feelings with old fashioned meanings
Just stay in love with yourself

If you can't give me love (Love)
If you can't give me love (Love)
If you can't give me love (Love)

But honey I ain't looking for that
What I need is a man (lady), not some so-called aristocrat
Oh if only you'd waited, just hesitated, or maybe just asked me to dance
But you really don't know why I don't want to go
And baby that's why we don't stand a chance

Oh, you're a hard one, I know that you got your reasons,
These things that are pleasin' you can hurt you somehow
Don't you draw the queen of diamonds boy,
She'll beat you if she's able,
You know the queen of hearts is always your best bet
Now it seems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table
But you only want the ones you can't get.......
Desperado, oh you ain't getting no younger,
Your pain and your hunger, they're drivin' you home
And freedom,  well, that's just some people talking
Your prison is walkin' through this world all alone
Don't your feet get cold in the winter time
The sky won't snow and the sun won't shine
It's hard to tell the night time from the day
You're losin' all your highs and lows
Ain't it funny how the feelin' goes away......
Desperado, why don't you come to your senses
Come down from your fences,  open the gate
It may be raining,  but there's a rainbow above you

In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older I tripped the merry-go-round
With this very unpleasing, sneezing and wheezing, the calliope crashed to the ground
Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for a hot spot snappin' his fingers clappin' his hands
And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her hand
And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand
And some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers, ""Daddy's within earshot, save the buckshot, turn up the band""
And she was blinded by the light
Oh, cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
She got down but she never got tight, but she'll make it alright
Some brimstone baritone anti-cyclone rolling stone preacher from the east
He says, ""Dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that's where they expect it least""
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner all alone watchin' the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance
And she was blinded by the light
Oh, cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
He got down but he never got tight, but he's gonna make it tonight
Some silicone sister with her manager's mister told me I got what it takes
She said, ""I'll turn you on sonny, to something strong if you'll play that song with the funky break""
And Go-cart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe to go outside
And little Early-Pearly came by in her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride
Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer playin' backyard bombardier
Yes and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent a dude with a calling card who said, 
""Do what you like, but don't do it here""
Well, I jumped up, turned around, spit in the air, fell on the ground, asked him which was the way back home
He said, ""Take a right at the light, keep goin' straight until night, and then, boys, you're on your own""
And now in Zanzibar a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car hummin' a lunar tune
Yes, and the avatar said, ""Blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar 
we're gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon""
And some kidnapped handicap was complainin' that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night
Well I unsnapped his skull cap, between his ears I saw a gap and figured he'd be all right
He was just blinded by the light
Cut loose like a deuce another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Mama always told me not to look into the sights of the sun
Whoa , but mama that's where the fun is Ooh, yeah

She left here last early spring, is living there I hear
Say for me that I'm alright though things get kinda slow
She might think that I've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so. 
We had a falling out like lovers often will
And to think of how she left that night it still brings me a chill
Though our seperation it pierced me to the heart
She still lives inside of me we've never been apart
If you get close to her kiss her once for me
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free
Oh whatever makes her happy I wont stand in the way
Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
And I've never gotten used to it I just learned to turn it off
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting soft

I know every scene by heart they all went by so fast

a tutti i suoi retaggi indifferente

non sai dove andare
ma sai che ovunque andrai

rivivono, ci chiamano
boschi abbandonati
e perciò sopravvissuti vergini
si aprono, ci abbracciano

Just relax, take it easy, you’re still young

Find a girl, settle down, if you want you can marry.

But tell me, how can you stand there with your broken heart
Ashamed of playing the fool
One thing can lead to an-other; 
it doesn't take any sac-ri-fice
Oh, father and mother, sis-ter and brother,
if it feels nice, don't think twice
Just shower the people you love with love
Show them the way that you feel
Things are gonna work out fine if you only will
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way that you feel
Things are gonna be much better if you only will.
    You can run but you cannot hide;
       this is widely known
And what you plan to do with your foolish pride
when you're all by yourself alone
Once you tell somebody the way that you feel
you can feel it beginning to ease
I think it's true what they say about the squeaky wheel
always getting the grease.
Just shower the people you love with love
Show them the way that you feel
Things are gonna work out fine if you only will
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way that you feel
Things are gonna be much better if you only will.
Better to shower the people you love with love
Show them the way that you feel
Things are gonna be just fine if you only will
Shower the people you love with love
Show them the way that you feel
Things are gonna be much better if you only will.
Shower the people you love with love; show them the way that you feel (repeat)

  They say the rain must fall
  Just like pouring rain
  Make it rain
  Make it rain....  Love, love, love is sunshine.

From rockin' of the boat,

Pretty soon little girl I'm gonna take charge

and I'm heading straight into the storm Gonna be a twister to blow everything down

Blow away the dreams that break your heart Blow away the lies that leave you 
But lost and brokenhearted

But all around me everybody's multiplying,
And they're walking 'round like flies, man,
So I'm no better than the animals,
Sitting in their cages in the zoo, man,
'Cause com - pared to the flowers, and the birds, and the trees, 
I am an ape - man!
I think I'm so educated, and I'm so civilised,
'Cause I'm a strict vegetarian,
But with the over population, and inflation, and starvation,
And the crazy poli - tici - ans,
I don't feel safe in this world no more,
I don't wanna die in a nuclear war,
I wanna sail away to a distant shore,
And make like an ape - man!

I'm a King Kong man, I'm a vood - doo man,
Oh, I'm an ape - man,

Com - pared to the clouds as they roll by,

And the motor traffic rumble,    but, give me half a chance,
And I'd be taking off my clothes, and living in the jungle,

Is swinging up and down in a coconut tree,
Oh, what a life of luxury to be like an ape - man!

Oh, I'm an ape - man,
I'm a King Kong man, I'm a vood - doo man,

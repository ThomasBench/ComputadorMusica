 Unfaithful servant, you don't have to say you're sorry,
 If you done it just for the spite, or did ya do it just for the glory?
 Like a stranger you turned your back,
Left your keys and gone to pack.
Bear in mind who's to blame, and all the shame;
 She really cared, the time she spared and the home you shared.
 Goodbye to that country home,
 So long to a lady I have known,
 Farewell to my other side,
 I'd best just take it in stride.
 Unfaithful Servant, you'll learn to find your place;
 I can see it in your smile,
 and, yes, I can see it in your face.
 The mem'ries will linger on,
 But the good old days, they're all gone,
Oh! Lonesome servant, can't you see,
 That we're still one and the same, just you and me.

Making the shape of his questions to heaven
Whether the sun will fall in the evening,

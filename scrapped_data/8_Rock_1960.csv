Lovely Rita meter maid
Lovely Rita meter maid,
Nothing can come between us.
When it gets dark I tow your heart away.
Standing by a parking meter,
When I caught a glimpse of Rita,
Filling in a ticket in her little white book.
In a cap she looked much older,
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man.
Lovely Rita meter maid,
May I inquire discreetly,
When are you free to take some tea with me?
Took her out and tried to win her.
Had a laugh and over dinner,
Told her I would really like to see her again.
Got the bill and Rita paid it.
Took her home I nearly made it,
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two. Oh
Lovely Rita meter maid,
Where would I be without you?
Give us a wink and make me think of you.

3,Penny Lane,The Beatles,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-beatles/penny-lane-chords-479539,"In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs   
Of every head he's had the pleasure  to    know
And all the people that come and go,  stop and say hello.     
On the corner is a   banker with a motorcar,
The little children laugh at  him    behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mack in the pouring rain,     very strange.
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back
In Penny Lane there is a  fireman with an hourglass    
And in his pocket is a  portrait of the  Queen 
He likes to keep his fire engine clean, It's a clean machine.

ahh ahhh
ah ahhah       ah ah ah ah
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
     A four of fish and finger pie in summer, meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And tho' she feels as if she's in a play, she is anyway.
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain,      very strange.
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies

12,Need Your Love So Bad,Fleetwood Mac,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/fleetwood-mac/need-your-love-so-bad-chords-1475494,"I need someone's hand, to lead me through the night
I need someone's arms, to hold and squeeze me tight
Now when the night begins,      I'm at an end
Because I need   your love so bad.
I need some lips, to feel next to mine
I need someone to stand up, and tell me when I'm lyin'
And when the lights are low,  and it's time to go
That's when I need   your love so bad.
So why don't you give it up, and bring it home to me
Or write it on a piece of paper baby, so it can be read to me
Tell me that you love me, and stop driving me mad
Oh because I,    I need your love so bad.
I need your soft voice, to talk to me at night
I don't want you to worry baby, I know we can make everything alright
Listen to my plea, baby,    bring it to me
Because I need   your love so bad.

There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
 And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
   Rocky didn't like that
He said ""I'm gonna get that boy""
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said ""Danny boy this is a showdown""
But Daniel was hot- he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said ""Rocky you met your match""
And Rocky said, ""Doc it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better doc as soon as I am able""
Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room 
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival

Don't wanna cry when there's people there.
I get shy when they start to stare.
I'm gonna hide myself away, hey. But I'll come back again some day.
And when I do you better hide all the girls.
I'm gonna break their hearts all round the world.
Until then I'll cry instead.

As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale
She said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see......
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well been closed

 While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
 Still my guitar gently weeps
 I don't know why   nobody told you   how to unfold your love
 I don't know how  someone controlled you
 They bought and sold you
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
 While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
 Still my guitar gently weeps
 I don't know how   you were diverted
 You were perverted too
 I don't know how  you were inverted
 No one alerted you
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
 While my guitar gently weeps
 Look at you all...

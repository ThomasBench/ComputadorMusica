0,Ordinary Love,U2,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/u2/ordinary-love-chords-1443058,"The sea wants to kiss the golden shore
The sunlight warms your skin
All the beauty that's been lost before
Wants to find us again
I can't fight you  anymore
It's you I'm fighting for
The sea throws rocks together
But time leaves us polished stones
We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
We cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love
Birds fly high in the summer sky
And rest on the breeze
The same wind will take care of you and
I    will build our house in the trees
Your heart is on my sleeve
Did you put there with a magic marker
For years I would believe  
That the world couldn't wash it away
We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
We cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love
   Are we tough enough
For ordinary love
We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
We cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love
We can't fall any further
If we can't feel ordinary love
We cannot reach any higher
If we can't deal with ordinary love

Nervous as he tells me it's his first time on a plane.
We took off and headed East, I was thumbing through the magazines.
  He felt like talking and offered me his name.
So I asked him how he was
And he smiled and said, Well son,
I've been better, I've been worse
I've chased after pretty girls
Seen a couple places that I never though I'd see
I've walked into harder times, and I've walked out the other side
It seems like you end up getting what you need
Yeah, looking down from 30,000 feet, life's been good to me
I've been out a month or so, another night, another show
One hundred different cities, they all just seem the same
He asked me what it must be like, singing songs under the lights
Well, it's got its moments, just the same as anything
I miss my town, I miss my wife
But I'm up here with you tonight
I've been better, I've been worse
I have loved a pretty girl
Seen a couple places that I never though I'd see
I've walked into harder times, and I've walked out the other side
IT seems like you end up getting what you need
Yeah, looking down from 30,000 feet, life's been good to me
                Good to me
Sometimes we can get lost living in the here and now
Sometimes it takes the sky to see what's on the ground
I've been better, I've been worse
I have chased after a pretty girl
Seen a couple places that I never though I'd see
I've walked into harder times, and I've walked out the other side
IT seems like you end up getting what you need
Yeah, looking down from 30,000 feet, life's been good to me

nautin vain lomasta

ei tule enää reissuja evitskogiin
vanhemmat eros ja mökki myytiin
 kävin eilen ajamassa mökkitien
 muistin, että kauemmin se vie
 tutut reitit vaihtuneet pintoihin mustiin
 ei ukkikaan kerro enää sodasta
 se kasvaa heinää honkanummella
 nyt paremmin ymmärrän tarinan
 ja hänen tekojaan arvostan
 Faija anna mun ajaa mökkitie

I called you up, but we'd both agree
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance.

With his back against the San Francisco traffic
On the bridges side that faces towards the jail
Setting out to join a demographic,
He hoists his first leg up over the rail.
A phone call's made, police cars show up quickly.
The sergeant slams his passenger door.
He says, Hey son why don't you talk through this with me,
Just tell me what you're doing it for.
Oh, it's a little bit of everything,
It's the mountains, it's the fog,
It's the news at six o'clock,
It's the death of my first dog.
It's the angels up above me,
It's the song that they don't sing,
It's a little bit of everything.
There's an older man who stands in a buffet line,
He is smiling and he's holding out his plate,
And the further he looks back into his timeline,
That hard road always led him to today.
Making up for when his bright future had left him,
Making up for the fact that his only son is gone,
And letting everything out once, his server asks him,
Have you figured out yet, what it is you want?
I want a little bit of everything,
The biscuits and the beans,
Whatever helps me to forget about
The things that brought me to my knees.
So pile on those mashed potatoes,
And an extra chicken wing,
I'm having a little bit of everything.
Somewhere a pretty girl is writing invitations,
To a wedding she has scheduled for the fall,
Her man says, Baby, can I make an observation?
You don't seem to be having any fun at all.
She said, You just worry about your groomsmen and your shirt-size,
And rest assured that this is making me feel good,
I think that love is so much easier than you realize,
If you can give yourself to someone, then you should.
Cause it's a little bit of everything,
The way you joke, the way you ache,
It is getting up before you,
So I could watch you as you wake.
So on the day in late September,
It's not some stupid little ring,
I'm getting a little bit of everything.
Oh, it's a little bit of everything,
It's the matador and the bull,
It's the suggested daily dosage,
It's the red moon when it's full.
All these psychics and these doctors,
They're all right and they're all wrong,
It's like trying to make out every word,
When they should simply hum along.
It's not some message written in the dark,
Or some truth that no one's sees,
It's a little bit of everything.

Every one of them met tragic ends,
   With every passing day,
I'd be lying if I didn’t say,
That I miss them all tonight
And if they only knew what I would say
If I could be with you tonight
I would sing you to sleep,
Never let them take the light behind your eyes

As we fade in the dark, just remember
you will always burn as bright
     Be strong, and hold my hand.
Time, it comes for us, you'll understand.
     We'll say goodbye today,
And I'm sorry how it ends this way
If you promise not to cry
Then I'll tell you just what I would say
If I could be with you tonight
I would sing you to sleep,

you will always burn as bright

popped through the grass,

tree and suffered minor injuries

but he’s tripping balls, he’s tripping testes,
he got lost in the shower and he barely knows the hour

and in the box I’ll type,
I’ll know all the numbers to try,
I wanna know the lyrics that you think of when you’re high

in love with weird cut bangs and sweaters swaying kind of awkwardly
I’m in love with fresh air friends from overheated houses
till I uber up a giant park and dump my body in my dorm bed

I don’t call people anything that’s thought to be so sweet

and all these pretend spouses are a happy storybook,
that’ll turn to stark non-fiction in the time it took
for me to notice that I’m old, which means I’ll be 30 and happy
likely married to personified business casual khakis
and I’ll forget about it when I wake up late and stupid
I tried to tell the uber driver till he tried to hit it
I tried to tell myself because I’ve come this far along

Pupils glowing thoughts are flowing
Towards my lovely company
Your perfect kisses, hold me softly

Pests they follow me
Telling me my awful feelings
Make me hate everything

So let's arm the masses and see what the bastards do then.
Walking tall once set us apart, now we're down on all fours.
Do you cry my name in the dark, like I do yours?
These storms are getting stronger now, trusses all bend and sway.
Lightning hits, the power goes out in the fray.
As the waves crash high and the shoreline disappears,
I will scream to the sky: ""Hey, people live here!""
My dreams are not unlike yours,
They long for the safety and break like a glass chandelier.
But there's laughter and oh there is love, just past the edge of our fears.
And there is chaos when push comes to shove, but it's music to my ears.
May you be in heaven before the devil knows you're dead.
May these winds be always at your back.
'Cause when we're all just ghosts and the madness overtakes us,
We will look at the ashes and say: ""People lived here.""
From the penthouse to the holy martyr,
Sea to shining sea,
From the coffins full of kindergartners,
Is this what you call free?
From the hate that drips from all your crosses,
Are your hands so clean?
And the wildfire, it is spreading far,
From sea to shining sea.
When we're all just ghosts and the madness overtakes us,
Yeah I'll scream to the sky: ""Hey, people live here.""

Just teach me to despise.
Will time make men more wise?
Here within my lonely frame,
My eyes just hurt my brain.
But will it seem the same?
Come tomorrow, will I be older?
Come tomorrow, may be a soldier.
Come tomorrow, may I be bolder than today?
Now, the trees are almost green.
But will they still be seen?
When time and tide have been.
Fall, into your passing hands.
Please don't destroy these lands.
Don't make them desert sands.
Come tomorrow, will I be older?
Come tomorrow, may be a soldier.
Come tomorrow, may I be bolder than today?
Soon, I hope that I will find,
Thoughts deep within my mind.
That won't disgrace my kind.

Silly, but it’s true
Thinking of a sweet romance
Beginning in a queue
In the sun the ice was melting
No more sheltering now

Led me to a vow

You never cared for secrets I'd confide.
For you I'm just an ornament,
Something for your pride.
Always running, never caring,

Stolen minutes of your time 
were all you had to give.

The story's in the past with nothing to recall.
I've got my life to live and I 
don't need you at all
The roller coaster ride we took is
nearly at an end.
I bought my ticket with my tears, 
that's all I'm gonna spend.
And I think it's gonna be all right.

The morning sun is shining like a red rubber ball.  X2

Prestarme aquel cacharro que en el fondo apareció

Temblaba como un loco atacado de sambito, sí señor, bip, bip
Daba pena ver aquel perol, yu bi-du-bi du-bi-du du-bi
Monté mi cacharrito a una gran velocidad
A diez millas por hora recorrí por la ciudad
En cuento yo pare una morena a mi lado se montó, bip, bip
La chica se prendió de mi perol, yu bi-du-bi du-bi-du du-bi
Y muchas otras chicas que encontré por el camino
Estaban encantadas de montar en mi carrito
Conforme pasa el tiempo yo me estoy encariñando más y más, bip, bip

Lavado, preparado y pintado de verdad

And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes,
And your silver cross, and your voice like chimes,
Oh, who do they think could bury you?
With your pockets well protected at last,
And your streetcar visions which you place on the grass,
And your flesh like silk, and your face like glass,
who could they get to carry you?
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I put them by your gate,
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace, 
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace,
And your basement clothes and your hollow face,
Who among them can think he could outguess you?
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Into your eyes where the moonlight swims,
And your match-book songs and your gypsy hymns,
Who among them would try to impress you?
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I put them by your gate,
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss,
And you wouldn't know it would happen like this,
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug,
And your Spanish manners and your mother's drugs,
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew plugs,
Who among them do you think could resist you?
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I put them by your gate,
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
To show you the dead angels that they used to hide.
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Oh, how could they ever mistake you?
They wished you'd accepted the blame for the farm,
But with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm,
And with the child of a hoodlum wrapped up in your arms,
How could they ever, ever persuade you?
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I put them by your gate,
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row,
And your magazine-husband who one day just had to go,
And your gentleness now, which you just can't help but show,
Who among them do you think would employ you?
Now you stand with your thief, you're on his parole
With your holy medallion which your fingertips fold,
And your saint like face and your ghostlike soul,
Oh, who among them do you think could destroy you?
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands,
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes,
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums,
Should I put them by your gate,
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?

        Sitting on a hillside
        Watching all the people die
        I'll feel much better on the other side
        I'll bum a ride
        I believe in magic
        Why, because it is so quick
        I don't need power when I'm hypnotized

        Count me out
        I don't need the time of day

There in the road, it was straight ahead, the car was stalled, the engine was dead
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right, never forget the sound that night
The cryin' tires, the bustin' glass, the painful scream that I heard last
Well, where oh where can my baby be? The Lord took her away from me
  She's gone to heaven so I got to be good, so I can see my baby when I
leave this world
Well when I woke up, the rain was pouring down, there were people standing all around
Something warm a-runnin' in my eyes, but I found my baby somehow that night
I raised her head, and when she smiled and said, ""Hold me darling just a little while"",
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss, I found the love that I knew that I'd miss
But now she's gone, even though I hold her tight, I lost my love, my life, that night

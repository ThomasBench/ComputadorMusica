  Counting days ’til it’s over, my friends ‘til it’s over, my friends, count along
  Feeling rich, feeling poor, feeling nothing more
Self destructive on a rollercoaster fireball
  She’s on a hunt, cooking cooking cooking misery
  Left my heart on the shelf for way too long
Sick and tired, picking up from the dirty floor
I saw the line of snakes that came to me
The taste of good memories
A bag full of hope that was only for me and you
  No more broken dreams I feel like a loaded gun
Spitting bullets at your armor of mind control
  She’s on a hunt, cooking cooking cooking misery
  Cannot think, cannot talk, cannot do it right
Can’t call the doctor, he’s as sick as you and I
I saw the line of snakes that came to me
The taste of good memories
A bag full of hope that was only for me and you
So innocent were the days
The taste of good memories
A bag full of hope that was only for me and you
  Counting days ‘til it’s over, my friends
‘Til it’s over, my friends, count along

  Counting days ‘til it’s over, my friends
’Til it’s over, my friends, count along
  Counting days ’til it’s over, my friends
‘Til it’s over that thing called love
The taste of good memories
A bag full of hope that was only for me and you
So innocent were the days
The taste of good memories
A bag full of hope that was only for me and you
Please let it grow, where it belongs
There in the dark where the shadows are born
Leave it alone. I’m sure it will find its way to redeem and blossom
‘Cause I know..., the black rose will find its home

Never turns the lights down low
She can go there if you want her though.
There are no markings on her country roads,
No signs that show the way back home,
But when you get there you won't wanna go.
I've frozen all my desires,
Covered up in virgin snow
But when I stand beside her,
She burns yeah, she burns
Like petrol-soaked paper and fireworks,
And I'm burning, yeah I'm burning
I'm burning so deeply just breathing hurts,
I'm melting darling and I can't let go.
She likes to lay under the covers oh,
Pretend that everywhere's our home
Keeps me warm into my very soul
We get so tangled up it's hard to know
What is hers and what's my own
Vines at the bottom of an olive grove.
I've frozen all my desires,
Covered up in virgin snow
But when I stand beside her,

sopra gli stagni e le pozzanghere in città
sembra che se ne freghino
della ricchezza che ora viene e dopo va
prendimi non mi concedere
nessuna replica alle tue fatalità
eccomi son tutto un fremito, ehi...
Passano alcune musiche
ma quando passano la terra tremerà
sembrano esplosioni inutili
ma in certi cuori qualche cosa resterà
non si sa come si creano
costellazioni di galassie e di energia
giocano a dadi gli uomini
resta sul tavolo un avanzo di magia
Sono solo stasera senza di te
mi hai lasciato da solo davanti al cielo
e non so leggere, vienimi a prendere
mi riconosci ho le tasche piene di sassi
Sono solo stasera senza di te
mi hai lasciato da solo davanti a scuola
mi vien da piangere arriva subito
mi riconosci ho le scarpe piene di passi
la faccia piena di schiaffi
il cuore pieno di battiti
e gli occhi pieni di te
Sbocciano i fiori sbocciano
e danno tutto quel che hanno in libertà
donano non si interessano
di ricompense e tutto quello che verrà
mormora la gente mormora
falla tacere praticando l'allegria
giocano a dadi gli uomini
resta sul tavolo un avanzo di magia
Sono solo stasera senza di te
mi hai lasciato da solo davanti al cielo
e non so leggere, vienimi a prendere
mi riconosci ho un mantello fatto di stracci
Sono solo stasera senza di te

I looked your direction for excessive inspection
And I could not muster the courage to say a single word to you

But everyone cheated and no one could spell
You didn't say much of anything
I must have come off annoying cause you went to bed
I'll walk home with my eyes low
Dreaming of conversations we'll have tomorrow
Loose ends, my new friends
All the classes in high school we fell asleep in
And now I can hardly close my eyes
The next time I saw you was in your apartment
Oh why do I keep ending up here on starlit evenings?
I should be home sleeping
But this time you sat next to me on the couch (nice)
I stare out the window, hands glued tight and sore
Praying to god-knows-what that you would sever what stuck
With something shiny from the kitchen drawer
I'll walk home with my eyes low

And now I can hardly close my eyes

In a big city, they just dropped me off.

Burning out rubber

How he could have let her slip away
So long ago but still he wants to know
If anyone has seen her
And he’s sitting out in the night
Looking down upon the lights of Taormina
They were young and love was shining
Like the colours of the rainbow
Desire felt like choking
Love was smoking under the volcano
He can still taste her kisses
Sweet as the red wine from Messina
Now he’s sitting out in the night
Looking down upon the lights of Taormina
When they rambled along the shore
She used to call him her sweet senor
On a pathway to the sea
Maybe there they’ll be
The crowd calls for the emperor
Raise their hands to hail another king
But he’s been so long a wanderer
Another crowd can never mean a thing
He came, he saw, he conquered
Ten thousand voices roared in the arena
Now he’s sitting out in the night
Looking down upon the lights of Taormina
He hears the chimes of history
Myths of gods and men forever ringing
Ancient dreams in all their mystery
Wars for Sicily and Spartan women
In the mists of antiquity
Ships of war set sail from Carthagina
Now he’s sitting out in the night
Looking down upon the lights of Taormina

down the back streets where the pines grow

Leave it hanging on the line, lost inside my head,
is this the way I'll be denied again?

I've come to talk with you again,
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left it's seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence.
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone,
'neath the halo of a street lamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence.
And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking,
People hearing without listening,
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence.
Fools said i, you do not know
Silence like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you.
But my words like silent raindrops fell,
In the wells of silence
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made.
And the sign flashed out it's warning,
In the words that it was forming.
And the sign said, the words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.
And whisper'd in the sounds of silence.

Somewhere between all the land and the sky
Being by never forgiving
Nobody knows you and neither do I
Birds may believe at a distance
You wear a grin and keep perfectly still
Driven away with persistence
I wonder if they have wondered
Or will ever wonder, ever wonder
Farmer Jim hums when he's all alone
He may imagine you heard and he knew
You wouldn't hear what he might have known
I wonder whether he wonders if you ever wonder
Ever wonder
Scarecrow
Maybe the wind knows
Whether you wonder
Who's calling your name
Scarecrow
Maybe the wind knows
Whether you wonder
If you are to blame
Mother Earth's love whispered to me (and it wasn't her fault)
Real is a feeling and feeling is real
All of you are flowing through me
But you wouldn't know how to fathom or feel
When the wind blows
The wind knows
The wind knows
Scarecrow
Maybe the wind knows
Whether you wonder
Who's calling your name
Shame how nobody knows you
Only who wonders if you are to blame
Saving the grain of your golden domain
Without even reasoning why
The crows seem to know where you need them to go
Igniting a spark in their minds so they circle and fly
Fly
Fly  Fly    X7
You hang around for a living
Blown in the wind like a pinned butterfly
Monarch of ever forgiving
Some of us wonder if you want to die
Would you want to die?
How I wonder
Ever wonder
Ever wonder
Ever wonder

Textin', Ex's, get my feels
Sweatin' bullets, Netflix-chills
World's out there singin' the blues
Twenty more dead on the evening news
Think to myself: ""really, what's the use?""
I'm just like you, I was born to lose
Why oh why can't you just fix me?
When all I want's to feel numb
But the medication's all gone
Why oh why does God hate me?

46,Found What Ive Been Looking For,Tom Grennan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tom-grennan/found-what-ive-been-looking-for-chords-2140711,"Always fine lines between us
They say our days don’t mean much
Cast an anchor in the sand, what we did
But my ships have sailed and I’m here to tell that
I don’t mean like the others
And I…
I keep searching and I can’t seem to find what I’m wanting
It’s changing all the time and if you notice a different side of mine
Then I’ve found what I’ve been looking for
Found what I’ve been looking for
Found what I’ve been looking for
Found what I’ve been looking for
Should I wait, should I stay to see it
Arm fold cause I’m told, I need it
I’m not frightened to take off, step away
But my ships have sailed and I’m here to tell that
I don’t mean like the others
And I…
I keep searching and I can’t seem to find what I’m wanting
It’s changing all the time and if you notice a different side of mine
Then I’ve found what I’ve been looking for
Found what I’ve been looking for
Found what I’ve been looking for
Found what I’ve been looking for
I’ve been running round, running round, running round
Now I’m done, done now, done now, done now
Scared the magic might fade away
I keep searching and I can’t seem to find what I’m wanting
It’s changing all the time and if you notice a different side of mine
Then I’ve found what I’ve been looking for
Found what I’ve been looking for
Found what I’ve been looking for
Found what I’ve been looking for
Found what I’ve been looking for
Found what I’ve been looking for

But throwing stones could never be
The perfect way to start
Cos sticks and stones make broken bones
Empty words make broken homes
But its love that broke our hearts
And if I knew what you were thinking
I would stop this boat from sinking
But darling you are like the sand
And you're slipping through my hands
I just don't know what you're thinking
You're just a photo in a drawer
But photographs are not much more
Than ghosts we can't forget
You're just a red rag to a bull
You're just a false hope for a fool
But it's as close as I can get
And if I knew what you were thinking
I would stop this boat from sinking
But darling you are like the sun
Setting when my evening comes
I just don't know what you're thinking
And I will stop the sky from falling
If I knew
If I knew
And I will love you every morning
If I knew
If I knew
And if I knew what you were thinking
I would stop this boat from sinking
But darling you are like the stars
I know I can't reach that far.
I just don't know what you're thinking

Wind me tighter than a wire
It's something that you do to me
I run away like mercury
And I know you think it's rough
When you're try'na patch us up
And I say honey what is love?
You just say I drink too much
Maybe I'm defective or maybe I'm dumb
I'm sorry, so sorry for what I've done
Maybe I'm bad natured or maybe I'm young
I'm sorry, so sorry for what I've done
And I'm the t-shirt that I wear
Pick the thorns out of my hair
I broke your heart so carelessly
But made the pieces part of me
And now it hurts what we've become
'Cause you taught me how to love
It's me who taught you how to stop
And you just say I drink too much

49,In A Black Out (ver 3),Hamilton Leithauser,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/hamilton-leithauser/in-a-black-out-chords-1930811,"I   live in a nameless town
No  need to wander around
I   live in a nameless town
In a black out
Many friends have said goodbye
Paraded out in one proud line
I say they all just lost their minds
Midnight where we used to dance
Underneath the ugly halogen lamps
Oh, it all went away so fast
In a black out
We’ll wait for the year
When the tide comes
Rolling over the rails
From here 'til the end
Of the island
Washing away
I rent a room with all our stuff
When you come home I’d lift you up
And there’s only the two of us
In a black out
Now you’re sleeping in the back
Of a speeding yellow cab
Throw a kiss goodbye to all of that

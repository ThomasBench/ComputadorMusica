Try as I absolutely totally might
The bones are melting, the skeleton is ash
The clavicle detaches and falls with a deafening crash
And I'm not your protagonist
I'm not even my own
I don't know anything
I don't even know what I don't know
And if you look outside you’ll see
disintegrating trees
The artificial way the sunlight bounces off the waxy leaves
My heart catches on every thorn
You’re already halfway out the door
And I’ve never looked so old
And I have never been so cold
And it is 85 degrees
I don’t know what I need
There’s lukewarm herbal mango sweet hibiscus tea
On the hot garbage pile in which I fucking sleep
The walls are empty, it’s so ugly
I could burn the whole place down
It wouldn’t catch ‘cause all the posters 
are on their way to my hometown
And I'm not your protagonist
I'm not even my own
I don't know anything
I don't even know what I don't know
And if you look outside you’ll see
disintegrating trees
The artificial way the sunlight bounces off the glitching leaves
My wet heart catches on every thorn
You’re already halfway out the door
And I’m so tiny and so old
And God it’s never been so cold
And it is 85 degrees
I don’t know what I need

1,Sex With A Ghost,Teddy Hyde,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/teddy-hyde/sex-with-a-ghost-chords-3030128,"I'm getting hickeys from my bed bugs
I'm getting busy with a bad perfume
I'm sticking kisses to a pen drug
I'm making friction with a sad vaccuum
I'm getting jiggy with a rifle
I pull the trigger with my eyes closed
Hoping to hit you somewhere vital
And when I miss, you come and kiss me with a smile
I'm having sex with a ghost 'cause she knows I'm alone
She's a freak in the sheets, play it cool, I'm sleeping with a ghoul
I'm having sex with a ghost 'cause she knows I'm alone
She's a freak in the sheets, play it cool, I'm sleeping with a ghoul
The only time I ever see her
Is when she's behind me in the mirror
Even from a distance I can hear her
Try to listen, but her whispers make my ears hurt
And on our dates, it's never daytime
When she gets playful with a steak knife
I need a break, maybe I'll take five
I'm having sex with a ghost 'cause she knows I'm alone
She's a freak in the sheets, play it cool, I'm sleeping with a ghoul
I'm having sex with a ghost 'cause she knows I'm alone
She's a freak in the sheets, play it cool, I'm sleeping with a ghoul
I'm having sex with a ghost 'cause she knows I'm alone
She's a freak in the sheets, play it cool, I'm sleeping with a ghoul
I'm having sex with a ghost 'cause she knows I'm alone
She's a freak in the sheets, play it cool, I'm sleeping with a ghoul

Said, woman, take it slow and it'll work itself out fine

But you know, love, there's one more thing to consider
Said, woman, take it slow and things will be just fine
You and I'll just use a little patience
Said, sugar, take the time 'cause the lights are shinin' bright
You and I've got what it takes to make it, ooh
I've been walkin' the streets at night
Just tryin' to get it right
Hard to see with so many around
You know I don't like bein' stuck in the crowd
An' the streets don't change, but maybe the names
I ain't got time for the game 'cause I need you

Felt the moment settle so
I couldn't wait to tell you why
I'm standin' here with this awkward smile
  And that's because
I could drown myself in someone like you
I could dive so deep I never come out
I thought it was impossible
But you make it possible
Love, it stings and then it laughs
At every beat of my battered heart
The sudden jolt, a tender kiss
I know I'm gonna die of this
  And that's because
I could drown myself in someone like you
I could dive so deep I never come out
I thought it was impossible
But you make it possible
I'll take the smooth with the rough
Feels so fucked up to be in love

I hope the problems that make your life harder
Sit stubborn in your stomach like your kidney stones"", and yet

Without wanting to hit yourself?

He said that smokin' was a killer
He said he knows that I've been bitter

A re-lief, beckon deep blue, fettered in the magnet sun
Eat the gun as it feeds you, spitting up the oxy-gen 
Once a-gain                     
Once a-gain 
Once a-gain, empty horses, gallop through the violet door
Follow red, crooked courses, shadows on the moonlit floor
Oh my stars, winged creatures, gathering in silken height 
Like the last human teachers
Once a-gain, we must bleed new, even as the hours shake 
Crystal blood like a dream true, a ripple in the wound and wake
You be-lieve, I be-lieve too, that you are the river of light
Who I love that I cling to, in the belly of the empty night
From the thirty first floor, of the simulation swarm
With the drone of fluor-escence, flicker, fever, fill the form
With a warm gush how I wanna touch, like we never could be-fore
I’d fly to you to-morrow, I’m not fighting in this war
I wanna drop my arms and take your arms and walk you to the shore
    I re-member, building an energy shield
In your room, like a temple, swallows in the windless field
Very thin, with your mother, tall as a pale green tree
Very wild, bright as winter, rising with a prism key 
And a child to de-liver,  taken with the blood and vine
It's the first little angel
    Little Andy,   soft in your newborn skin
Only one, little Andy,   will you return a-gain
I be-lieve we can re-new, and you could be my brother
Once a-gain, fall a-sleep with, our backs against each other
You be-lieve, I be-lieve too, that you are the river of light
Who I love that I sing to, in the belly of the empty night
From the thirty first floor, of the simulation swarm
With the drone of fluor-escence, flicker, fever, fill the form
With a warm gush how I wanna touch, like we never could be-fore

I wanna be calm like the soft
Summer rain on your back
Like the fall of your shoulders
But everything just brings me back down
To the cold hard ground
And it keeps getting colder
It’s a feeling that boils in my brain
I would dial back the flame
But I’m not sure I’m able
I’m wobbling out on the wire
And the lights could go out
With the break of a cable
Things feel that low sometimes
Even when everything is fine
Hey I’ve been falling apart these days
Split open watching my heart go
Round and around
Round and around
Circle the drain
I’m going down
Round and around
Round and around
Round and around
Round and around
I’m trying to seem strong for my love
For my family and friends
But I’m so tired of faking
‘Cause I’m chained to my bed when they’re gone
Watching tv alone
Until my body starts aching
And I think there’s mold in my brain
Spreading down all the way
Through my heart and my body
‘Cause I cling to the dark of my room
And the days thin me out
Or just burn me straight through
Things feel that low sometimes
Even when everything is fine
Hey I’ve been falling apart these days
Split open watching my heart go
Round and around
Round and around
Circle the drain
I’m going down

Just tell me what you want to do, tell me what you want
To burn away ‘cause I could be your stoker
Open up your heart like the gates of Hell
You stay soft, get beaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get eaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get beaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get eaten
Only natural to harden up

Not gonna wake up here anymore
Listen one time, it's not the truth
It's just the story I tell to you
Easy to say, easy to do
But it's not easy, well maybe for you
Hope that you find it, hope that it's good
Hope that you read it, think that you should
Cuts you some slack as he sits back
Sizes you up, plans his attack
I got it all, I got it all
Waiting for me out on the street
And now you gotta do something special for me
I'm gonna say what's on my mind
Then I'll walk out, then I'll feel fine
Yeah, I'm under his thumb, I'm on his back
I will not show my teeth too quick
I needed you there, I needed you there
I didn't know, I didn't know...
Back from his trip, he's at the door
When he gets back, waits on his phone
Innocent eyes, innocent heart
No, it's not wrong but it's not right
Innocent time out on his own
Not gonna do that, fuck I'm out of control
I was just bored playing the guitar
Learned all your tricks, wasn't too hard
It's the last one now, I can promise you that
I'm gonna find out the truth when I get back
Gone now are the old times
Forgotten, time to hold on the railing
The Rubik's Cube isn't solving for us
Old friends, long forgotten
The old ways at the bottom of
The ocean now has swallowed
The only thing that's left is us
So pardon the silence that you're hearing
Is turnin' into a deafening, painful, shameful roar

Footsteps down familiar sidewalks
Knowing that we were here in our dreams last night

I know you feel them too        
Riding shotgun next to your free slurpie
They know all of my habits
But they don't know about you
I hope that's true
Mmm, mmm, mmn
We made sangria and failed
I spilled mac n cheese on my pants
And thought about kissing you underneath kitchen lights

Oh they just stand there while we're taking shots of brandy
They know all of my habits
But they don't know about you

I can see it now
He stands up there and wipes his tears
I can see it now
And all my ghosts disappear
I can see it crystal clear

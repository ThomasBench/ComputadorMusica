0,Things That Make It Warm,cavetown,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/cavetown/things-that-make-it-warm-chords-2867615,"My feathers seem to have taken the brunt of the storm
They are feeling pretty worn
We finally found shelter
Tucked away inside a wall
Though for now it's pretty small
You and me
We can make this hole a home
We can fill it up with grass and all the things that make it warm
When you leave
To go fly across the sea
I’ll be waiting here
With Junior and the flowers that we’ve grown
Collecting clumps of sticks and leaves
Has left me pretty tired
Can I rest with you a while?
We snuggle up between the stones
Wind blows peacefully
There’s no place I’d rather be
You and me
We can make this hole our home
We can fill it up with grass and all the things that make it warm
When you leave
To go fly across the sea
I’ll be waiting here
With Junior and the flowers that we’ve grown

I’d surely be delighted to be the one you give the last oreo to
If that’s alright with you
Do you wanna sit next to me on the bus home?
I told my mom not to pick me up today
I hope that that’s okay
‘Cause this kindergarten crush has got my stomach all twisted
You're sweeter than sugar, lover I'm addicted
My brain is doing bunny loops, I'm a disaster
Everything you do just makes my heart beat faster
I'm too scared to talk to you
I try to keep my courage but I end up getting nervous
And my face goes blue
You stick to me like
Every time I wanna tell you how I feel
I freeze up, my knees start to shake
And the way you look is so unreal
You're my own Achilles heel
And this kindergarten crush has got my stomach all twisted
You're sweeter than sugar, lover I'm addicted
My brain is doing bunny loops, I'm a disaster
Everything you do just makes my heart beat faster
Oh, this kindergarten crush is getting me wrong
I don't know what to do so I wrote you a song
And this thing is going further than originally planned
So I hope you won't mind if I ask you to hold my hand

And some days I'm not
Some days I am only
A little bit sad, not a lot
How do you
How do you make a home?
What to do
Cause I never stay too long
Every house looks the same
In my dreams
Every house feels like home
For a couple weeks
I been runnin' 'round
Tryna find a place where I can breathe
But me oh my
Under an April sky
And you feel like
City life, apple pie baked just right
Home is wherever you are tonight
Some days feel empty
And some days feel whole
Some day we can be in the same city
Some day we'll be grown and I'll be fine with packing up
Cardboard boxes filled and sad farewells
And I'll be fine with that goodbye
As long as I can say goodbye to you as well
Cause every house looks the same
In my dreams
Every house feels like home
For a couple weeks

Might be no AC
But see if I'm with you, it's okay

Stealing the groove, the widening gap
Unfastening rails from a past with no map

Gone like a thistle that's blown on the breeze

All your little fake friends will sell your secrets for some cash
Smile in my face, then put your cig out on my back
If you ever see me, just get to runnin' like the Flash
I knew a boy just like you
He’s a snake, just like you
Such a fake, just like you
But I can see the truth
Transparent soul
I can see right through, just so you know
Transparent soul
I can see right through, just so you know
I don't fucking know if it's paradise or it's a trap
Yeah, they're treating me like royalty, but is it kissin' ass?
No one's brave enough to take the fall right
But it's all your fault, why you actin’ like it’s alright?
I knew a girl just like you
She was vain, just like you
Such a pain, just like you
And everybody knows the truth
Transparent soul
I can see right through, just so you know
Transparent soul
I can see right through, just so you know
It's clear to me now
You’re scared of me, wow
It's clear to me now (Transparent Soul)
It's clear to me now
You're scared of me, wow
It’s clear to me now (Transparent Soul)
Transparent soul
I can see right through, just so you know
Transparent soul
I can see right through, just so you know

Sitting on your mother's table, next to you is her
Carving out our names into each piece of wood and concrete
Told her, ""I don't have a lot, babe,  you can have my soul
Baby do you want me? (x2)
Baby do you want me? (no, no, no)
In your mind, this is a new inglorious morning
You ain't never gonna let nobody take that light again
Everyone I know is slowly falling in the ocean
I don't wanna be the next to row, I never learned to swim
Baby do you love me? (x2)
Baby do you love me? (no, no, no)
In my mind, you are the road I chose to travel
Might as well have been the very last thing I decide
Half the time I'm lost, afraid that you're just borrowed
Don't matter much to me man, not afraid to die
Baby are you with me?
Do you forgive me?
You're the one I wanted, want now, want when I am old.   (x2)
     When I'm falling. (x2)

We're driving so fast
Hands off the window
And we're not going back
Somewhere on a green hill
Laughin' so loud
Takin' my body
And you takin' it down
Break me     down
And I'll call you mine
And I know
I've been  around
And I'll call   you mine
And break me     down
And I'll call you mine
And I know
I've been around
Sitting on the backseat
We're driving so fast
Living in a daydream
It's too good to last
Rainy days and bad luck
Come in my way
I look for you when I'm lost
So I don't go insane
Break me     down
And I'll call you mine
And I know
I've been  around
And I'll call   you mine
And break me     down
And I'll call you mine
And I know
I've been around
So show me that you really care
That you really care
Show me that you'rе gonna stay
Hold mе like you'll never lеavе
Like you'll never leave
      Like you'll never leave
Break me     down
And I'll call you mine
And I know
I've been   around
Break me     down
And I'll call you mine

I've been   around
And I'll call you mine
Break me     down
And I'll call you mine
And I know

There'll be no bad blood
Losing your love has been hard enough
Life can be short, but life can be sweet
No hard feelings, honey
The next time we meet
It's not hard to remember
When it was tough to hear your name
Crying in the bathtub
To ""Love Is A Losing Game""
But there's only so much sulking
That the heart can entertain
No hard feelings, honey
Next time you come my way
The threads that kept us together
Were already wеaring thin
Would we ever havе tied the knot
Well how long is a piece of string?
And for everything that ends
Something else must begin
No hard feelings, honey
And we both will take the win

Oh oh oh he's a working class man
well he's a steel town deciple, he's a legend of his kind, he's running like
a cyclone across
the wild mid western sky
oh oh oh he's a working class man
he believes in god and elvis
he gets out when he can
he did his time in vietnam
still mad at uncle sam
he's a simple man
with a heart of gold
in a complicated land
oh he's a working class man
well he loves a little woman
someday he'll make his wife
saving all the overtime
for the one love of his life
he ain't worried about tomorrow
cause he just made up his mind
life's too short for burning bridges
take it one day at a time
oh oh oh he's a working class man
oh oh oh he's a working class man
oh yeah
yes he is
well he's a working class man

ease my troubles that's what you do.

greets the day with hope and comfort, too.
You fill my life with laughter   and somehow you make it better,
ease my troubles that's what you do.
There's a love that's divine
and it's yours and it's mine....like the sun.
And at the end of the day
we should give thanks and pray to the one, to the one.

5,The Final Cut Album,Pink Floyd,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/pink-floyd/the-final-cut-chords-79196,"Tell me true, tell me why was Jesus crucified?
Is it for this that daddy died?
Was it you? Was it me?
Did I watch too much T.V.?
Is that a hint of accusation in your eyes?
If it wasn't for the Nips
Being so good at building ships,
The yards would still be open on the Clyde.
And it can't be much fun for them
Beneath the rising sun
With all their kids committing suicide.
What have we done, Maggie what have we done?
What have we done to England?
Should we shout, should we scream,
""What happened to the post war dream?""
Oh, Maggie,
Maggie what have we done?
They flutter behind you your possible pasts,
Some brighteyed and crazy, some frightened and lost.
A warning to anyone still in command
Of their possible future, to take care.
In derelict sidings the poppies entwine
With cattle trucks lying in wait for the next time.
Do you remember me, how we used to be,
Do you think we shoud be closer?
She stood in the doorway, the ghost of a smile
Haunting her face like a cheap hotel sign.
Her cold eyes imploring the men in their macs
For the gold in their bags or the knives in their backs.
Stepping up boldly one put out his hand.
He said, ""I was just a child then, now I'm only a man.""
Do you remember me,  how we used to be,
Do you think we should be closer?
By the cold and religious we were taken in hand
Shown how to feel good and told to feel bad.
Strung out behind us the banners and flags
Of our possible pasts lie in tatters and rags.
Do you remember me, how we used to be,
Do you think we should be closer?
When you're one of the few to land on your feet,
Jesus, Jesus, what's it all about?
And even now part of me flies over
Dresden at angels one five.
Though they'll never fathom it behind my
Sarcasm desperate memories lie.
Sweetheart sweetheart are you fast asleep? Good.
When we came back from the war the banners and
Flags hung on everyone's door.
We danced and we sang in the street and
The church bells rang.
But burning in my heart,
My memory smoulders on
Of the gunners dying words on the intercom.
Floating down through the clouds
Memories come rushing up to meet me now.
In the space between the heavens
And in the corner of some foreign field,
I had a dream,
I had a dream.
Goodbye Max, goodbye Ma.
After the service when you're walking slowly to the car
And the silver in her hair shines in the cold November air,
You hear the tolling bell, and touch the silk in your lapel,
And as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band,
You take her frail hand and hold on to the dream.
A place to stay, enough to eat,
Somewhere old heroes shuffle safely down the street.
Where you can speak out loud about your doubts and fears,
And what's more no-one ever disappears,
You never hear their standard issue kicking in your door.
You can relax on both sides of the tracks,
And maniacs don't blow holes in bandsmen by remote control,
And everyone has recourse to the law,
And no-one kills the children anymore.
No-one kills the children anymore.
Night after night, going round and round my brain,
His dream is driving me insane___________________.
In the corner of some foreign field,
The gunner sleeps tonight.
What's done is done.
We cannot just write off his final scene.
Take heed of his dream,
Take heed.
Button your lip and don't let the shield slip.
Take a fresh grip on your bullet proof mask.
And if they try to break down your disguise with their questions
You can hide, hide, hide,
Behind paranoid eyes.
You put on our brave face and slip over the road for a jar,
Fixing your grin as you casually lean on the bar.
Laughing too loud at the rest of the world
With the boys in the crowd.
You hide, hide, hide,
Behind petrified eyes.
You believed in their stories of fame, fortune and glory.
Now you're lost in a haze of alchohol soft middle age.
The pie in the sky turned out to be miles too high.
And you hide, hide, hide,
Brezhnev took Afghanistan.
Begin took Beirut.
Galtieri took the Union Jack.
And Maggie, over lunch one day,
Took a cruiser with all hands
Apparently to make him give it back.
Mm________.
Take all your overgrown infants away, somewhere,
And build them a home, a little place of their own.
The Fletcher Memorial Home for incurable tyrants     and   kings.
And they can appear to themselves every day,
On closed circuit T.V. to make sure they're still real.
It's the only connection they feel.
""Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Reagan and Haig,
Mr. Begin and friend, Mrs. Thatcher and Paisley,
Mr. Brezhnev and party, the ghost of McCarthy,
The memories of Nixon. And now adding colour,
A group of anonymous Latin-American meat packing glitterati.""
Did they expect us to treat them with any respect?
They can polish their medals and sharpen their smiles,
And amuse themselves playing games for a while.
Boom boom, bang bang, lie down you're dead.
Safe in the permanent gaze of a cold glass eye,
With their favorite toys, they'll be good girls and boys.
In   the Fletcher Memorial Home for colonial wasters of life and   limb.
Is everone in? Are you having a nice time?
Now the final solution can be applied.
They disembarked in 45,
And no-one spoke and no-one smiled
There were to many spaces in the line.
All agreed with the hand on heart,
To sheath the sacrificial knives.
But now she stands upon Southampton dock
With her handkerchief
And her summer frock clings
To her wet body in the rain.
White upon the slippery reins
She bravely waves the boys goodbye again.
Mm______.
And still the dark stain spreads between
His shoulder blades.
A mute reminder of the poppy fields and graves.
And when the fight was over
We spent what they had made.
But in the bottom of our hearts
We felt the final cut.
Through the fish-eyed lens of tear stained eyes____
I can barely define the shape of this moment in time.
And far from flying high in clear blue skies___,
I'm spiralling down to the hole in the ground where I hide.
If you negotiate the minefield in the drive,
And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes,
And if you make it past the shotgun in the hall,
Dial the combination, open the priesthole
And if I'm in I'll tell you what's behind the wall.
There's a kid who had a big hallucination
Making love to girls in magazines.
He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith.
Could anybody love him
Or is it just a crazy dream___?
And if I show you my dark side
Will you still hold me tonight?
And if I open my heart to you
And show you my weak side,
What would you do?
Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone?
Would you take the children away
And leave me alone?
And smile in reassurance
As you whisper down the phone,
Would you send me packing,
Or would you take me home?
Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings,
Thought I oughta tear the curtain down.
I held the blade in trembling hands,
Prepared to make it but just then the phone rang,
I never had the nerve to make the final cut.
Fuck all that we've got to get on with these
Gotta compete with the wily Japanese.
There's too many home fires burning
And not enough trees,
So fuck all that
We've got to get on with these.
Clickity click   Hold on     Oh no       Brrrrrrrrrring bingo!
Make 'em laugh.   Make 'em cry.   Make 'em dance in the aisles.
Make 'em pay.     Make 'em stay.  Make'em feel ok.
Not nah John
We've got to get on with the film show.
Hollywood waits at the end of the rainbow.
Who cares what it's about
As long as the kids go.
Not now John
Got to get on with the show.
Hang on John we've got to get on with this.
I don't know what it is
But it fits on here like.....
Come at the end of the shift,
We'll go and get pissed.
But now now John
I've got to get on with this.
Hold on John
I think there's something good on.
I used to read books but.....
It could be the news,
Or some other abuse,
Or it could be reusable shows.
Fuck all that we've got to get on with these
Got to compete with the wily Japanese.
No need to worry about the Vietnamese.
Got to bring the Russian bear to his knees.
Well, maybe not the Russian bear,
Maybe the Swedes.
We showed Argentina
Now let's go and show these.
Make us feel tough
And wouldn't Maggie be pleased?
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah!
In my rear view mirror the sun is going down,
Sinking behind bridges in the road
And I think of all the good things
That we have left undone
And I suffer premonitions,
Confirm suspicions,
Of the holocaust to come.
The wire that holds the cork
That keeps the anger in,
Gives way
And suddenly it's day again.
The sun is in the east
Even though the day is done.
Two suns in the sunset
Hmmmmmmmmmm
Could be the human race is run.
Like the moment when the brakes lock
And you slide towards the big truck
You stretch the frozen moments with your fear.
And you'll never hear their voices,
And you'll never see their faces,
You have no recourse to the law anymore.
And as the windshield melts
My tears eveaporate,
Leaving only charcoal to defend.
Finally I understand the feelings of the few.
Ashes and diamonds,
Foe and friend,
We were all equal in the end.

When every sunrise meant a sunny day, oh a sunny day
But now when the morning light shines in
It only disturbs the dreamland where I lay, oh where I lay
I used to thank the Lord when I'd wake
For life and love and the golden sky above me
But now I pray the stars will go on shinin'
You see in my dreams you love me
Daybreak is a joyful time
Just listen to the songbird harmonies, oh the harmonies
But, I wish the dawn would never come
I wish there was silence in the trees, oh the trees
If only I could stay asleep
At least I could pretend you're thinkin' of me
'Cause nighttime is the one time I am happy
You see in my dreams
We climb and climb and at the top we fly
Let the world go on below us
We are lost in time
And I don't know really what it means
All I know is that you love me
In my dreams
I keep hopin' one day I'll awaken
And somehow she'll be lying by my side
And as I wonder if the dawn is really breakin'
She touches me and suddenly I'm alive
And we climb and climb and at the top we fly

 One day will be improved.
Eternal rights we left behind,
 We were the better kind.
Two the same, set free too,
 I always looked to you,
 I always looked to you,
 I always looked to you.
We fought for good, stood side by side,
 Our friendship never died.
On stranger waves, the lows and highs,
 Our vision touched the sky,
Immortalists with points to prove,
 I put my trust in you,
 I put my trust in you,
 I put my trust in you.
A house somewhere on foreign soil,
 Where aging lovers call,
Is this your goal, your final need?
 Where dogs and vultures eat?
Committed still, I turn to go,
 I put my trust in you.
 I put my trust in you.
 I put my trust in you.
 I put my trust in you,
In you, in you, in you.
Put my trust in you, in you.

Depends upon the tears you weep,

Put her hand on my hip
And I close one eye now
Sweap on her lip
An I surrender to the fever
I surrender to the will of the night

Même jour, même heure, mêmes pommes
On verra quand on aura trente ans
Sur les marches d’la place des grands hommes
Le jour est venu et moi aussi, et j’veux pas être le premier
Si on n’avait plus rien à s’dire et si, et si, j’fais des détours dans l’quartier
C’est fou c’un crépuscule de printemps, rappelle le même crépuscule d’y’a dix ans
Trottoirs usés par les regards baissés, qu’est-ce qu j’ai fais d’ces années
J’ai pas flotté tranquille sur l’eau, j’ai pas nagé le vent dans l’dos
Dernière ligne droite, la rue Souflot, combien seront là, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 ?

Même jour, même heure, mêmes pommes
On verra quand on aura trente ans
Sur les marches d’la place des grands hommes

Eric voulait explorer l’subconscient, remonte-t-il à la surface de temps en temps
J’ai un peu peur de regarder l’miroir, si j’y allais pas j’me serais trompé d’un soir
Devant une vitrine d’antiquités, j’imagine les retrouvailles de l’amitié:
T’as pas changé, qu’est-ce c’tu devient ? Tu t’es mariée ta trois gamins
T’as réussi, tu fais médecin, et toi, Pascal, tu t’marres toujours pour rien ?

J’ai rencontré des tempêtes et des bourrasques, comme vous, comme vous, comme vous
Chaque amour morte à une nouvelle a fait place, et vous, et vous, et vous
Et toi Marco, qui ambitionnait simplement, d’être heureux dans la vie
As-tu réussi ton pari ? Et toi François, et toi Laurence, et toi Marion,
Et toi Bruno, et toi Gégé, et toi Evelyne…
Eh bien c’est formidable, les copains, on s’est tout dit on s’serre la main
On peut pas mettre dix ans sur table, comme on étale ses lettres au Scrabble
Dans la vitrine je vois l’reflet, d’une lycéenne derrière moi
Elle part à gauche, je la suivrai, si c’est à droite…
Attendez-moi !,
Attendez-moi !
Attendez-moi !
Attendez-moi …………………. ahhhhhhhhhhhh

And I've left behind the empty streets that once inspired my life
And the strength of the emotion is like thunder in the air
'Cos the promise that we made each other haunts me to the end

I've been searching for in everyone I meet
And the times I've been mistaken it's impossible to say
And the grass is growing under neath our feet

     Tell her I'll be waiting    ...in the usual place,
             With the tired and weary,        and there's no escape,
    To need a woman...   you've got to know...
      ...how the strong get weak,      and the rich get poor,
    You're running with me,       don't touch the ground,
           We're the restless hearted,       not the chained and bound,
    The sky is burning,      a sea of flame,
          Though your world is changing,
        I will be the same, 
Oh, oh - oh---!  Slave to     love!  |  /   /   /   /  |
Slave to love!  (Nah, nan -na, nah!)    Woh - oh, oh!

    The storm is breaking,       or so it seems,

    Now spring is turning    ...your face to mine,
            I can hear your laughter,
        I can see your smile

And I can't escape,       I'm a slave to love           :|| [Repeat]

1,Ikaros,Björn Afzelius,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/943082,"När jag tänker tillbaka på min barndom
Ser jag skräckbilder tydligast av allt
Ja, de gånger de skrämde eller slog mig
Är de minnen som hårdast sitter fast
För som barn tar man kärleken för given;
Allting annat är mot ens natur
I den stund man tar steget ut i livet
Är man bara ett tillgivet djur
Ändå står snart de vuxna där och pekar
Ut den riktning de tycker man skall ta
Alla drömmar de själva har förvägrats
Vill de förverkliga genom sina barn
Är man lydig belönas man och hyllas
Revolterar man mister man allt
Ingen älskar ett barn som inte lyckas
Ingen älskar ett barn som är starkt
Men vem besitter förmågan att veta
Vad som ryms i en ny individ?
Och vem kan säg' till nån annan hur lyckan ser ut
Vem kan säg' vad nån annan vill bli?
Låt dina blommor slå rot där det finns jordmån
Låt dina växter få leva där de trivs
Lås inte in dina plantor i ett drivhus
Låt de få slippa ett onaturligt liv
Låt den du älskar få pröva sina vingar
En dag så flyger din älskade rätt
Vill du bli respekterad av din avbild
Så får du visa din avbild respekt

Lived 9 to 5 and worked his fingers to the bone.
Just barely out of school, came from the edge of town.
Fought like a switchblade so no one could take him down.
He had no money, ooh, no good at home.
He walked the streets a soldier and he fought the world alone

Your crime is time and it's, eighteen and life to go.
Eighteen and life you got it.  Eighteen and life you know.
Your crime is time and it's, eighteen and life to go.
Tequila in his heartbeat, his veins burned gasoline.
It kept his motor running, but it never kept him clean.
They say he loved adventure, Ricky's the wild one.
He married trouble had a courtship with a gun.
Bang, bang shoot 'em up, the party never ends.
You can't think of dying when that bottle's your best friend.
Eighteen and life you got it.  Eighteen and life you know.
Your crime is time and it's, eighteen and life to go.
Eighteen and life you got it.  Eighteen and life you know.
Your crime is time and it's, eighteen and life to go.
""Accidents will happen"", they all heard Ricky say.
He fired his six-shot to the wind, that child blew a child away.

    You know I don't like watching anybody make the same mistakes I made
    She's a real nice girl and she's always there for you
    But a nice girl wouldn't tell you what you should do
    Oh, listen boy, I'm sure that you think you got it all under control
    You don't want somebody telling you the way to stay in someone's soul
    You're a big boy now and you'll never let her go
    But that's just the kind of thing she ought to know
    Tell her about it, tell her everything you feel
    Give her every reason to accept that you're for reee  - aaal
    Tell her about it, tell her all your crazy dreams
    Let her know you need her, let her know how much she meee - ans
Ohoo
    Listen, boy, it's not automatically a certain guarantee
    To insure yourself, you've got to provide communication constantly
    When you love someone you're always insecure
    And there's only one good way to reassure
    Tell her about it, let her know how much you care
    When she can't be with you, tell her you wish you were thee -  ere
    Tell her about it, every day before you leave
    Pay her some attention, give her something to belie - eve
    'Cause now and then she'll get to worrying
    Just because you haven't spoken for so long
    And though you may not have done anything
    Will that be a consolation when she's gone
    Listen boy, it's good information from a man who's made mistakes
    Just a word or two that she gets from you could be the difference that it makes
    She's a trusting soul, she's put her trust in you
    But a girl like that won't tell you what you should do
    Tell her about it, tell her everything you feel
    Give her every reason to accept that you're for reee  - aaal
    Tell her about it, tell her all your crazy dreams
    Let her know you need her, let her know how much she meee - ans
    Tell her about it, tell her how you feel right now
    Tell her about it, the girl don't want to wait too long
    You got to tell her about it, tell her now and you won't go wrong
    You got to tell her about it before it gets too late you got to tell her about it... (fade)

though i tried not to hurt you, though i tried

every rose has its thorn
just like every night has its dawn
just like every cowboy sings his same old sad song
every rose has its thorn
i listen to our favourite song playing on the radio
hear the DJ say loves a game of easy come and easy go
but i wonder does he know
has it ever felt like this
and i know that you'd be here right now
if i could have let you know some how
every rose has its thorn
just like every night has its dawn
just like every cowboy sings his same old sad song
every rose has its thorn
though it's been a while now 
i can still feel so much pain
like a knife that cuts you the wound heals
but the scar, that scar remains
i know i could have saved our love that night 
if i'd known what to say
instead of making love
we both made our separate ways
and know i hear you found somebody new
and that i never meant that much to you 
to hear that tears me up inside 
and to see you cuts me like a knife

just like every night has its dawn

They bring you up to do, like your daddy done
Me and Mary we met in high school, when she was just seventeen
We'd drive out of this valley, down to where the fields were green
We'd go down to the river, and into the river we'd dive
Oh, oh, down to the river we'd ride
Then I got Mary pregnant, and man that was all she wrote
And for my nineteenth birthday, I got a union card, and a wedding coat
We went down to the courthouse, and the judge put it all to rest
No wedding day smiles, no walk down the aisle, no flowers, no wedding dress
That night we went down to the river and into the river we'd dive
Oh, oh, down to the river we did ride
I got a job working construction, for the Johnstown company
But lately there ain't been much work, on account of the economy
Now, all them things that seemed so important, well mister, they vanished right into the air
Now I just act like I don't remember, Mary acts like she don't care
But I remember us riding in my brother's car, her body tan and wet down at the reservoir
At night on them banks I'd lie awake, and pull her close just to feel each breath she'd take
Now those memories come back to haunt me, they haunt me like a curse
Is a dream a lie if it don't come true, or is it something worse
That sends me down to the river, though I know the river is dry
That sends me down to the river tonight
Down to the river, my baby and I

I've never done bad things, I've never done anything out of the blue

Under skies of smokey blue -green
I cant forsake a dixie dead shake
So we danced the sidewalk clean
My memory is muddy, what?s this river that I?m in?
Hey New Orleans is sinkin, man
And I dont want to swim
Colonel Tom, what's wrong? What's going on?
You can't tie yourself up for a deal
He said, Hey, north, you're south, shut your big mouth
You gotta do what you feel is real
Ain't got no picture postcards, ain't got no souvenirs
My baby she don't know me when I'm thinking bout those years
Pale as a light bulb hanging on a wire
Sucking up to someone just to stoke the fire
Picking out the highlights of the scenery
Saw a little cloud that looked a little like me
I had my hands in the river, my feet back up on the banks
Looked up to the lord above and said, Hey, man, thanks
Sometimes I feel so good I got to scream
She said, Gordie, baby, I know exactly what you mean
She said, she said, I swear to god she said

And whoa, my nights are so long!
 Where's my wife and family?
 What if I die   here?
 Who'll be my role-model?
 Now that my role - model is
Gone, gone

There were hints and allegations

Sound, the sound 
 Cattle in the marketplace
 Scatterlings and orphanages
He looks around, around
He sees angels in the architecture
 Spinning into infinity
He says, Amen! and Hallelujah!

And she turns her little radio on
She's had a rotten day so she hopes the DJ's

Are you the one and only who's sad and lonely you're reaching for the top
Well, the music keeps you going and it's never gonna stop
It's never gonna stop
It's never gonna, never gonna, never gonna, never gonna stop
The world is full of compromise and infinite red tape
But the music's got the magic it's your one chance for escape
Turn me on, turn me up, it's your turn to dream

   And God is never far away.

   wired,  And like a moth that tries to

Kryzysową narzeczoną
Razem ze mną pić
To, co nam tu nawarzono
Mogłaś moją być
Przy zgłuszonym odbiorniku
Aż po blady świt
Słuchać nowin i uderzać w gaz
Nie jeden raz
Nie jeden raz
Nie jeden raz
Mogłaś być już na dnie
Nigdy nie dowiesz się
Mogłaś moją być
Kryzysową narzeczoną
Pomalutku żyć
Tak jak nam tu naznaczono
Mogłaś moją być
Jakoś ze mną przebiedować
Zamiast życzyć mi
Na pocztówce nie wiadomo skąd
Wesołych Świąt!
Wesołych Świąt!
Wesołych Świąt!
Mogłaś być już na dnie

Tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away, but something in our minds will always stay
Perhaps this final act was meant to clinch a lifetime argument that nothingcomesfromviolence,nothin ever could
For all those born beneath an angry star, lest we forget how fragile we are...
On and on the rain will fall, like tears from a star, like tears from a star
On and on the rain will say, how fragile we are, how fragile we are

Don't ask me, what you know is true
Don't have to tell you, I love your precious heart
I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart
We could live for a thousand years
But if I hurt you, I'd make wine from your tears
I told you that we could fly
Cause we all have wings but some of us don't know why
I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never, ever, tear us apart
I (Don't ask me)
I was standing (You know it's true)
You were there (Worlds collided)
Two worlds collided (Shining through)
And they could never tear us apart

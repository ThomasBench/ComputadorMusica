0,Mighty Quinn,Manfred Mann,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/manfred-mann/mighty-quinn-chords-911900,"Come all without, come all within,
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn.
Come all without, come all within.
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn.
Everybody's building ships and boats.
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes.
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here,
everybody's gonna jump for joy.
Come all without, come all within.
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn.
I like to go just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet.
But jumping queues and makin' haste, just ain't my cup of meat.
Everyone's beneath the trees, feedin' pigeons on a limb.
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here,
all the pigeons gonna run to him.
Come all without, come all within,
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn.
Come all without, come all within.
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn.
Let me do what I wanna do, I can't decide 'em all.
Just tell me where to put 'em and I'll tell you who to call.
Nobody can get no sleep, there's someone on everyone's toes.
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here,
everybody's gonna wanna doze.
Come all without, come all within.
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn.
Come all without, come all within.
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn.
Come all without, come all within.
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn.
Come all without, come all within.
You'll not see nothing like the Mighty Quinn.(Fade.)

Tell me why, oh why, oh why can't my dream come true     oh, why
There must be peace and understanding sometime
Strong winds of promise that will blow away the doubt and fear
If I can dream of a warmer sun
Where hope keeps shining on everyone
Tell me why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear

 We're trapped in a world      that's troubled with pain
 But as long as a man has the strength to   dream
He can redeem his soul and fly       (He can fly)
Deep in my heart there's a trembling question
Still I am sure that the answer, answer's gonna come somehow
Out there in the dark, there's a beckoning candle, yeah

While I can stand, while I can walk
While I can dream, please let my dream come true, oh
Right now, 
Let it come true right now

There was sadness in her eyes.

Weren't much of a disguise.

Dancing, dancing on.
There was something missing
From her carefree little life,
And she'll never understand you
When you're kissing her good night.

Went and coolly stepped aside.

Might as well have died.

Just in time, at times, I guess
Because of you I need to rest
Because it~s you that sets the test
So much has gone and little is new
And as the sparrow sings
Dawn chorus for
Someone else to hear
The thinker sits alone
Growing older
~~I gave Them life, I gave Them all
They drained my very soul...dry
I crushed my heart to ease Their pains
No thought for me remains there
Nothing can they spare
What of me?
Who praised Their efforts to be free?
Words of strength and care and sympathy
I open doors that would have blocked their way
I braved Their cause to guide for little pay
I ravaged at my finanace just for Those
Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility
Those who said a new world, new ways ever free
Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me.~~

Flickers on me
My friends talk of glory, untold dream
Where all is God and God is just a word
~~We had a friend, a talking man
Who spoke of many powers that he had
Not of the best of men but Ours
We used him, We let him use his powers
We let him fill our needs       
Now we are strong.
And the road is coming to its end
Now the damned have not time to make amends
No purse of token fortunes stands in Our way
The silent guns of love will blast the sky
We broke the ruptured structure build of age
Our weapons were tongues of crying rage
Where money stood we planted seeds of rebirth
And stabbed the backs of fathers, sons of dirt
Infiltrated business cesspools
Hating through Our sleeves
Yea, and We slit the Catholic throat
Stoned the poor on slogans as:
        -Love Is All We Need-
        -Cut Up Your Friend-
        -Screw Up Your Brother or He~ll Get You In the End-
And We Know the Flag of Love is from Above
And We Can Force You to Be Free
And We Can Force You to Believe.~~
And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain
For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain
For they Knew not the words of the Free States~ refrain,
~~I Believe in the Power of Good
I Believe in the State of Love
I Will Fight For the Right to be Right
I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right.~~
And I open my eyes to look around
And I see a child laid slain on the ground
As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows
Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command
But not hearing anymore-
Not hearing anymore
Just the shrieks from the old rich
And I Want to Believe
In the madness that calls ~Now~
And I Want to Believe
That a light is shining through somehow
And I Want to Believe
And You Want to Believe
And We Want to Believe

But I feel fine
Cause your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love
It s coming closer
The flames are reaching my body
Please won t you help me
I feel like I m slipping away
Its hard to breath
And my chest is a-heaving
Lord almighty,
I m burning a hole where I lay
Cause your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love
With burning love
Ah, ah, burning love
I m just a hunk, a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love 4x

Never know how much I care.
When you put your arms around me
I get a, Fever that's so hard to bear.
You give me Fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever all through the night
Sun lights up the daytime,
Moon lights up the night.
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right.
You give me Fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever - in the morning
Fever all through the night
Ev'rybody's got the Fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long a---go
Romeo loved Juliet,
Juliet she felt the same.
When he pout his arms around her, he said,
""Julie, baby, you're my flame.""
Thou givest Fever, when we kisseth
Fever when thy flaming youth.
Fever - I'm a fire
Fever, yea I burn forsooth.
Captain Smith and Pocahantas
Had a very mad affair
When her Daddy tried to kill him, she said,
""Daddy-o don't you dare.""
He gives me Fever, with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever - I'm his Missus
Oh Daddy won't you treat him right
Now you've listened to my story
Here's a point that I have made.
Chicks were born to give you Fever
Be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
They give you fever, when you kiss them
Fever if you live and learn.
Fever - 'til you sizzle

And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight

He buys a gun, steals a car,
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries

While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you
I look from the wings at the plays you are staging
While my guitar gently weeps
As I'm sitting here doing nothing but aging
Still my guitar gently weeps

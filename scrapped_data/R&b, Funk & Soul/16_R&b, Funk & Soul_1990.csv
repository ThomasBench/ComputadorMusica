0,Who Do You Tell,Tamia,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tamia/who-do-you-tell-chords-3766586,"There you were in a crowded room
With someone, at least I assumed
How did I know I would fall in love
With you so soon
Just one look in your eyes and I see the truth
And I try hard to hide that I'm made for you
But I know deep inside, things that we could do
Just as long as we're together, oh
But who do you tell when you love someone?
Hoping that someone's in love with you
Who do you tell when you love someone?
I think I might as well tell you
I can't believe that I feel this way
There is so much I want to say
I want to touch you, hold you, feel you, please you
As we're making love all through the night
We would talk to each other
We would laugh and play
We would claim it's forever
Every night and day
We would share every minute
'Til the test of time
In my mind, baby, yeah, oh
Who do you tell when you love someone?
Hoping that someone's in love with you
Who do you tell when you love someone?
I think I might as well tell you
Who do you tell when you love someone?
Hoping that someone's in love with you
Who do you tell when you love someone?
I think I might as well tell you
Oh, I've hesitated much too many times
And I won't let you slip away from me
I know you're for me and me for you
But I don't know what to say or to do
So now that we're together
I'm telling you
Who do you tell when you love someone?
Hoping that someone's in love with you
Who do you tell when you love someone?
I think I might as well tell you
I think I might as well tell, tell you

The kind you make your wishes on
Oh, like the light in your eyes
The one I built my dreams upon
It's not there any longer
Something happened somewhere
and we both know why
But me, I'm getting stronger
   We must stop pretending,
  I can't live this life
  I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really wanna fight no more
(Too much talking, babe)
  Let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really wanna fight no more
This is time for letting go
  I hear a whisper in the air
It simply doesn't bother me
Can't you see that I don't care
Or are you looking right through me?
It seems to me that lately
You look at me the wrong way
and I start to cry
Could it be that maybe
This crazy situation
is the reason why?
  I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really wanna fight no more
(Too much talking, babe)
  Let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really wanna fight no more
(Tired of all these games)
   Oh, baby, don't you know
That I don't wanna hurt no more?
(it's time, I'm walking, babe)
  Don't care now who's to blame
I don't really wanna fight no more
This is time for letting go
   Hanging on to the past
   It only stands in our way
   We had to grow for our love to last
     But we just grew apart
    Oh, don't wanna hurt no more
  But, baby don't you know,
No, I don't wanna hurt no more
(Too much talking babe)

I don't really want to fight no more

Of the lonely house that once was home sweet home
Some things I know will chill you to the bone
Over there, sits the chair where she'd bring the paper to me
Sit down on my knee and whisper, “Oh I Love You”
But now she's gone forever and this old house will never be the same
without the love that we once knew
Straight ahead, That's the bed, where we'd lie in love together
And lord knows we had a good thing going here
Just to touch me and say,”good morning dear”
There's her ring. All her things and her clothes are in the closet
Where she left them when she tore my world apart
As you leave you see the nursery, oh she left me without mercy
Taking nothing but our baby and my heart
Step right up, come on in, come on in

Pop in a Isley Brothers tape and I'm maxing
Peeping through my side view, checking out my waxing
Hey, I gotta say
Today's a good day for me to live around the way (ho)
 Time to hit the 6-4
And pump the bass at 'em just to let 'em know

The sun is blazing, it's so amazing

11,Legend In My Living Room,Annie Lennox,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/annie-lennox/legend-in-my-living-room-chords-2947514,"When I was just seventeen, I ran away from home
To be with all the pretty people, to be on my own
Bright lights and trains and bedsit stains, pavements paved with gold
And I believed in everything that everybody told me
Have mercy.                 Have mercy on me
I found myself in a lonely place, with a suitcase full of dreams
And I soon grew up to realise, what living in the doghouse means
But everyday I told myself, good things would happen soon
’cause I knew that I was going to be a legend in my living room
 Have mercy.         Have mercy on me. Have mercy.
Have mercy on me
Now every day on a dead-end street, is where I spend my time
The dust has been collecting on, the corners of my mind
But I’ve shed my tears in bitter drops, until the thorn trees bloomed
To take the spiky fruit, to crown myself the King of Doom
Have mercy.                 Have mercy on me
Have mercy.       Oh Oh children, have mercy on me
                                                       Have mercy.       Listen to me people, have mercy on

When I saw you

When I saw you
When I saw you

Changing you with the tide
And dawn's ribbon of light
Bursts through the dark

I could not breathe, I fell so deep

Transcending space and time
And I was rendered still
There were no words for me to find at all
As I stood there beside myself
I could see you and no one else
When I saw you
When I saw you
 I   could not breathe
I fell so deep
Oh, when I saw you
When I saw you
I'd  never be
I'd never be the same
Only once in a lifetime love rushes in
Changing you with  the tide
And dawn's ribbon of light
Bursts through the dark
Wakening you  inside
And I thought it was all untrue
Until there all at once I knew
When I saw you
When I saw you
 I   could not breathe
I fell so deep
Oh, when I saw you
When I saw you
I'd  never be
I'd never be    the same
With no beginning and
Without an end
You are the one for me
And your eyes told me so
Your eyes let me know
When I saw you
When I saw you
I     could not breathe
I fell so deep
Oh, when I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never  be
I'd never be the same
Never be  the same

Love, if you're there come save me - From all this cold despair
I can hang when you're around - But I’ll surely die if you're not there
Love come quick - Love come in a hurry - There's thieves in the temple tonight
Feel like I'm looking for my soul, like a poor man looking for gold - There're thieves in the temple tonight
Voices from the sky say rely on your best friend to pull you through
Even if I wanted to I couldn't really truly cause my only friend is you – Come on
There're thieves in the temple tonight
Kicking me in my heart - Tearing me, tearing me, tearing me, tearing me all apart
Because me and you could've been a work of art (Thieves in the Temple)
Baby don't you know I'm holding on the best that I can - Love please help me be a better man
Better than the thieves in the temple - in the temple tonight
Oh, thieves in the temple    tonight (hurt me)

With the love that we're feeling in-side.
Share it with all the world,
And see each heart, kiss lonely good-bye.
 Maybe we can't; but maybe we can,
With the love that we're feeling in-side.
Share it with all the world, and see each heart,
Share it with all the world, and see each heart,
Share it with all the world,
And see each heart, kiss lonely good-bye.

On a Sunday afternoon 
You were there so was I 
In the park 4th of July
I was chillin' with my Kool-Aid 
When Miss Chilli came to relay
That you had a thang for me 
Finest thang you'd ever seen 
I must admit to you
I've heard them lines a time or two 
Although for some apparent reason 
Monkey lines are now in season 
Lights off, lights on 
I guess the groove is on so I am 
Diggin' the scene 
Baby bay-ooo-baby baby 
It's on like that 
I gotta be in love or somethin' like that 
I was like deep in a cool 
What'nt gone be nobody's fool
Could not care less who was there 
Could've been like anywhere 
I was chillin' with my Kool-Aid 
Did not want to par-ti-ci-pate 
In no silly conversations 
Had no time for new relation-ships 
I must admit to you 
When I heard the lines you threw 
Although it usually turns me off 
But this time you have turned me on 
Lights off, Lights on 
I guess the groove is on and I am 
Oh why do I feel the way I do 
When all I can think about is you 
What was it in a line 
That made me fall for you 
Do you know

   No I can't forget this evening
   Or your face as you were leaving
   But I guess that's just the way
   the story goes
   You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
   Yes it shows
   No I can't forget tomorrow
   When I think of all my sorrow
   When I had you there but then I
   let you go
   And now it's only fair that I should let you know
   What you should know
   CHORUS:   I can't live, if living is without you
             I can't live, if living is without you
   Well I can't forget this evening
   Or your face as you were leaving
   But I guess that's just the way
   the story goes
   You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
   Yes it shows

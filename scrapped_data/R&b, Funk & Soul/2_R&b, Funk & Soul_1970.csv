Dance, boogie wonderland
Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts of men
Who need more than they get
Daylight deals a bad hand to a woman
Who has laid too many bets
The mirror stares you in the face
And says,""Baby, uh, uh, it don't work""
You say your prayers though you don't care
You dance and shake the hurt
Dance, boogie wonderland
Dance, boogie wonderland
Sound fly through the night
I chase my vinyl dreams to boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
All the love in the world can't be gone
All the need to be loved can't be wrong
All the records are playing and my heart keeps saying
""Boogie wonderland,           wonderland""
Dance, boogie wonderland ha      ha
Dance, boogie wonderland ha      ha
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland

All the love in the world can't be gone
All the need to be loved can't be wrong
All the records are playing and my heart keeps saying

3,As (ver 2),Stevie Wonder,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/stevie-wonder/as-chords-258850,"     Do do do do, mmm-mmm-mmm,
      Do do do, do do do.
As a-round the sun, the earth knows she's re-volving,
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May.
Just as hate knows love's the cure; you can rest your mind assure,
That I'll be loving you  al-ways.
As now can't reveal the mystery of to-morrow,
But in passing will grow older every day.
Just as all that's born is new, you know what I say is true;
That I'll be loving you  al-ways.
   Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky, (always).
   Until the ocean covers every mountain high, (always).
   Until the dolphin flies, and parrots live at sea, (always).
   Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream.
     Did you know that true love asks for nothing?
     Her acceptance is the way we pay.
     Did you know that life has given love a guarantee?
To last through for-ever another day.
Just as time knew to move on since the be-ginning,
And the seasons know exactly when to change.
Just as kindness knows no shame; know through all your joy and pain;
That I'll be loving you  al-ways.
As to-day I know I'm living, but to-morrow;
Could make me the past; but that I mustn't fear.
For I'll know deep in my mind; the love of me I've left be-hind;;
That I'll be loving you  al-ways.
  Until the day is night and night becomes the day, (always).
  Until the trees and sea just up and fly a-way, (always).
  Until the day that 8x8x8 is 4, (always).
  Until the day, that is the day that are no more, (always).
  Until the day the earth starts turning right to left, (always).
  Until the earth just for the sun, denies it-self, (always).
  Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through, (always).
  Until the day that you are me and I am you, (always).
  Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky, (always).
  Until the ocean covers every mountain high, (always).
Ah  We all know, some-times life's hates and troubles,
Can make you wish you were born in a-nother time and space.
But you can bet your life, times that, and twice it's double;
That God knew ex-actly where he wanted you to be placed.
So make sure, when you say you're in it, but not out of it,
You're not helping to make this Earth a place sometimes called Hell.
Change your words into truths, and then change that truth into love,
And maybe our children's grandchildren,
And their great-great grandchildren will tell.        Ahh I'll be lovin you
  Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky, (always).
  Until the ocean covers every mountain high, (always).
  Until the dolphin flies, and parrots live at sea, (always).
  Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream.
  Until the day is night and night becomes the day, (always).
  Until the trees and sea just up and fly away
  Until the day that 8x8x8 is 4, (always).
  Until the day, that is the day that are no more, (always).
  Until the day the earth starts turning right to left, (always).
  Until the earth just for the sun, denies it-self, (always).
  Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through, (always).
  Until the day that you are me and I am you, (always).
  Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky, (always).
  Until the ocean covers every mountain high, (always).

We were young and we knew
And our eyes were alive
Deep inside we knew our love was true
For awhile we paid no mind to the past
We knew love would last
Every night somethin' right
Would invite us to begin the dance
Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be happy was sad
Somethin' happened along the way
And yesterday was all we had
And oh  after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around
Oh   oh   oh  after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found
For awhile to love each other with all
We would ever need
Love was strong for so long
Never knew that what was
Wrong oh baby wasn't right
We tried to find what we had
Till sadness was all we shared
We were scared this affair would lead our love into
Somethin' happened along the way
Yesterday was all we had
Somethin' happened along the way
What used to be happy is sad
Somethin' happened along the way
And yesterday was all we had
And oh  after the love has gone
How could you lead me on
And not let me stay around
Oh   oh   oh  after the love has gone
What used to be right is wrong
Can love that's lost be found
Oh   oh   oh  oh   oh   oh  after the love has gone

He lays her down-he frowns
""Gee my life's a funny thing
Am I still too young""
He kissed her then and there
She took his ring, took his babies
It took him minutes, took her nowhere
Heaven knows she'dve taken anything
All night-she want s the young American
Young American, young American
It's all right-but she wants the young American
Scanning life thru the picture window
She finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang
Heaven forbid she'll take anything
But the freak and his type-all for nothing
Misses a step and cuts his hand
Showing nothing he swoops like a song
She cries ""where have all papa's heroes gone?""
All night-she want s the young American
Young American, young American
It's all right-but she wants the young American
All the way from Washington
He breadwinner begs of the bathroom floor
""Live for just these twenty years
Do we have to die for the fifty more?""
All night-she want s the young American
Young American, young American
It's all right-but she wants the young American
Do you remember your President Nixon?
So you remember the bills you have to pay
or even yesterday?
Have you been the un-American
Just you and your id singing falsetto 'bout
leather, leather everywhere and
not a myth left from the Ghetto
Well, well, well would you carry a razor?
In case, just in case of depression
Sit on your hands on a bus of survivors
Blushing at all the afro-sheeners
Ain't that close to love?
Ein't that poster love?
Well it ain't that brbie doll
Her hearts have been broken just like you
All night-you want  the young American
Young American, young American
It's all right-you want the young American
You ain't a pimp and you ain't a hustler
Pimps got a Caddy-lady got a Chrysler
Black's got respect-white's got his soul train
Mama's got cramps and look at your hands hey
""I heard the news today, oh boy""
I got-suite and you got defeat
Ain't there a man-who could say no more
Ain't there a woman-I can sock on the jaw
Ain't there a child-I can hold without judging
Ain't there a pen-that will write before they die
Ain't you proud-that you've still got faces
and ain't there one damn song  that can make me
All night-you want  the young American
Young American, young American
It's all right-you want the young American
They pulled in just behind the bridge 
He laid her down - he frowns
Gee my life's a funny thing
Am I still too young
He kissed then and there
She took his ring took his babies
It him minutes took her nowhere
Heaven knows she'd've taken anything
All night - she wants the young American

Talkin' about saving souls and all the time leeching,
Dealing in dirt, and stealing in the name of the Lord

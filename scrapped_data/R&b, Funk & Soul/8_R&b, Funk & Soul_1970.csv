0,If We Hold On Together (ver 5),Diana Ross,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/diana-ross/if-we-hold-on-together-chords-1751642,"Don't lose your way, with each passing day
You've come so far, don't throw it away
Leave believing, dreams are for weeping
Wonders are waiting to start
Live your story, faith, hope and glory
Hold to the truth in your heart
   If we hold together
   I know our dreams will never die
   Dreams see us through, to forever
   Where clouds roll by, for you and I,
Souls in the wind, must learn how to bend
Seek out a star, hold on 'till the end
Valley.. Mountain, there is a fountain
Washes our tears all the way
Words are swaying, someone is praying
Please let us come home to stay
   If we hold together
   I know our dreams will never die
   Dreams see us through, to forever
   Where clouds roll by, for you and I,
When we are out there in the dark
We'll dream about the sun
In the dark, we'll feel the light
Warm our hearts...everyone
   If we hold together
   I know our dreams will never die
   Dreams see us through, to forever
As high... as souls can fly
the clouds roll by, for you and... I...

Besides what I read?
Can't find no work, can't find no job, my friend.
Money is tighter than it's ever been.

Across this land
Oh, what's happening brother?
What's happening? (What's happening, my man?)
Are they still getting down where we used to go and dance?
Will our ball club win the Pennant? Do you think they have a chance?

we'll eat some food that's rare
And at the head of the table
We'll place brother Henry's chair
Invite all the local big dogs,   we'll
laugh and talk and eat,     but we'll
save the bones for Henry Jones
'Cause Henry don't eat no meat
Today we'll go to market
and buy a lot of fish,
That will thrill Brother Henry
'Cause fish is his special dish
Get a large can of molasses,
So we'll have something sweet,
But we’ll   save the bones for Henry Jones,
'Cause Henry don't eat no meat.
Henry don’t like gravy
He don’t dunk or dip
He don't need no napkin,
'Cause the things he eats don't drip  bip
One day we had a banquet,
it really was a bake.
They started off with short ribs,
then they finished off with steak.
But when the feast was over,
brother Henry just kept his seat,
and we served the bones to Henry Jones,
'Cause Henry don't eat no meat.
Our banquet was most proper
right down to demitasse
From soup to lox and bagels
and pheasant under glass  we thought the chops were
mellow
He said his chops were beat
And we served the bones to Henry Jones
'Cause Henry don't eat no meat 
He shout for bean sprourts.  Henry don't eat no meat
Don't you care for bacon?  Henry don't eat no meat
Badly mistaken. Henry don't eat no meat
Been on fish since '66. Henry don't eat no meat
When he gets his kits so restricts. Henry don't eat no meat
Sure cant breathe when he eats that cheese. Henry don't eat no meat
I'm in the mood for seafood. Henry don't eat no meat
But he acts like he wants sea-food. Henry don't eat no meat.

 In the midst of herself playing Santa Claus,
She brings gifts... through her breeze.
 Morning rain, gently plays her rhythms on your window pane.
 Giving you no clue of when she plans to change,
To bring rain, or sun-shine.
 And so you wait to see what she'll do;
Is it sun or rain for you?
But it breaks your heart in two, when you find it's  Oc   -to -ber...
 And  she's gone, and she's gone.
Summer's gone,   taking with  her   summer's play...
 Winter wind, whispers to you that he wants to be your friend.
 But not waiting for your answer, he begins,
Forcing dangers way with his breeze.
 Morning snow, plans to have a winter ball for you to throw.
 But just where or when, he never lets you know,
If it's snow, or clear days you'll find.
 And so you wait to see what he'll do;
Is it sun or snow for you?
But it breaks your heart in two, 'cos you've been fooled by    Ap -ril...
 And   he's gone, and he's gone.
Winter's gone,    you find it's   Oc    -to -ber...

Let me know, let me know
Love, let me know, let me know
When you feel what you feel
Oh, how hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place
Before this love affair began
But if you feel, oh, like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
What I say I'm all about, all about
But at your best you are love

Be quiet as a mouse
  Met a man in Beirut
Having her name tattooed on his arm

Boots of Spanish leather, I never meant you any harm
I'm on my knees, your majesty;

It took him minutes, took her nowhere, heaven knows she'd 've taken anything, but
All night, she wants the young American, young American, young American
She wants the young American, all right, she wants the young American
Scanning life through the picture window, she finds the slinky vagabond
He coughs as he passes her Ford Mustang, but heaven forbid she'll take anything

Showing nothing, he swoops like a song, she cries, ""where have all Papa's heroes gone?""

There let me live till I wither and decay.
Long by the old Dismal Swamp have I wandered,
That's where this life of mine will pass away.
Soon we will meet on that bright and golden shore.
There we'll be happy   and free from all sorrow,
And there we'll meet, and part no more.

it was so thrilling.
What made it so great was I knew that your 
heart was willing.
I never thought that I'd give love a try,
then you came a-walking by and gave me my 
first taste of love.
Mmm, the very first time you held me, it was 
so nice.
I finally found this place they call paradise.
Oh, I was such a sad and lonely guy, then you 
came a-walking by and gave me my first taste of 
Your lips upon my lips, your arms around my waist.
How can I forget that first date?
Mmm, so keep your head on my shoulder, stay real 
close, baby, don't let go.
Don't think of tomorrow, let's live for tonight,
because I love you so.
You see that love light gleaming in my eye, swear

Don't put all your hope in one heart
Fie if you discover that she loves another
You'll be licked before you start
Now don't put all your dreams in one basket
Love is such a fragile thing
And if you should break it
Are you sure you can take it?
How would your heart forget to sing?
Don't put all your dreams in one basket
Don't upset your applecart
She may think she's clever and leave you forever
Then what will you tell your heart?
So don't put your dreams in one basket
Best made plans may go astray
If you play for hard stakes
You might play with heartaches
Never throw your dreams away
Never throw your dreams
awayyy

Sit alone by the phone,    a phone that never rings
Hoping to hear you say, you love me still
Knowing    you never will
Love, love, love has made a fool of me
Got me doing things, things that shouldn't be
Listening for the sound of your knock on my door
Knowing that sweet sound will be no more
Funny, how precious memories linger on
So long after you're gone
And oh, precious memories that only make me cry
But I keep holding on, oh why do I?
All because love, love, love makes me do these things
Speak your name softly each night
While holding your picture tight
When you took my heart,     you took my soul
And it's far beyond control

0,Take This Heart Of Mine,Marvin Gaye,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/marvin-gaye/take-this-heart-of-mine-chords-2536665,"Ooo, you say you're feelin' bad 'cause
The least thing makes you cry
Sounds like a real bad case
Of a girl who needs a guy
I think I know the perfect jewel
One you ought to try
Take a heart that's full of love
On this you can rely
If you need some quick reaction,   take this heart of mine
And if you need some satisfaction,   take this heart of mine
And if you're tired of being lonely,   take this heart of mine
I think I can help you if you'll only take this heart of mine
I may not be a doctor who can cure your ills
Prescribe you all those differnt colour hard-to-swallow pills
My remedy is older than the tale of Jack and Jill
My prescription is the kind you love to have refilled
If you need some satisfaction,       take this heart of mine
If you need some quick reaction,     take this heart of mine
Baby, if you're tired of being lonely,    take this heart of mine
Honey, I can help you if you'll only   take this heart of mine
Got a lovin' side (this heart of mine)
That's pure as gold (this heart of mine)
Take it, it's yours (this heart of mine)
To have and to hold (this heart of mine)
And if you do that, baby (this heart of mine)
After we grow old (this heart of mine)
It'll be the greatest love story (this heart of mine)
That was ever told (this heart of mine)
Oh, baby (one more time, let's hold)
Oh, medicine won't cure you
Just leave you at the most
The relief is only temporary
Pretty soon will go
But love can last a lifetime
When two hearts are close
Take as much as you want to
There is no overdose
If you need some quick reaction,   take this heart of mine
And if you need some satisfaction,   take this heart of mine
And if you're tired of being lonely,   take this heart of mine
I think I can help you if you'll only take this heart of mine

Instead of seein' me
I see you, I see your face
And inside me is a growing need for your embrace
In the light of day, though our faces meet
Someone there might see so we never speak
Till the dark of night, while the moon is new
While we whisper words of love in our secret rendezvous
Somethin's wrong I know, girl I love you so
Yes I need you, I need you baby
Oh you, my sweetest joy
You can afford the best of life
I'm just a heartbreakin' boy
Oh you've given your love to me
Girl, I can't let you hurt yourself by being seen with me
We're worlds apart, so close yet worlds apart
So we must hide the love we're feelin' in our hearts
We meet in shadows, your friends must never know
That we are lovers, darlin'
Although it hurts me so, for your sake no one must see
The press of love you're givin' me
But you know, I need you baby
One day I'll make the break, my love will start to shine
I can tell the world that you are mine, all mine
Till then we must go on the way we have before
And never let it show without each other's souls
I'll never one-way track 'cause there's no turnin' back
Oh I need you baby
You, you I see oh in my mirror in the mornin'
Instead of seein' me
I see you

With him that you will trust

Escape him if you can

 We were always hand in hand.
 I was hightop shoes and shirt tails, Suzy was in pig tails;
 I know I loved her even then.
You know my papa disapproved it, my mama boo-hooed it,
 But I told them time and time, a-gain;
""Don't you know, I was made to love her?
Built a world all a-round her"", yah! Hey, hey, hey.
She's been my inspiration, showed appreci-ation,
 For the love I gave her through the years.
Like a sweet magnolia tree, my love blossmed tender-ly.
 My life grew sweeter through the years.
I know that my baby loves me, my baby needs me,
 That's why we made it through the years.
I was made to love her, wor-ship and a-dore her, hey, hey, hey.
 All through thick and thin, our love just won't end.
My baby loves me, my baby needs me,
And I know I ain't going no-where.
I was knee high to a chicken, when that love bug bit me,
 I had the fever with each pa-ssing year.
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles, if this whole world crumbles,
 By her side, I'll still be standing there.
'Cos I was made to love her, I was made to live for her, ye-ea-ah!
Ah, I was made to love her, built my world all a-round her, hey, hey, hey.
Ooh baby, I was made to please her,
You know Stevie ain't gonna leave her, no, hey, hey, hey.
Ooh wee baby, my baby loves me, my baby needs me, hey, hey, hey...

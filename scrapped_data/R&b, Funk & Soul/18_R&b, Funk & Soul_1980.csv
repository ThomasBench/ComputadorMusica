I caught you smiling, I know I've seen you here before
How come you're hiding?, Hey don't you want to hit the floor?
The place is crowded, Or maybe you don't like the beat
I got a two-track playing in my head, So let me take you somewhere else instead
Dancing in the sheets, Dancing in the sheets
Grab your coat and wave goodbye to your friends, I want to take you where the night never ends
I feel the need to sweep you off of your feet,
You and me, we should be dancing in the sheets, Dancing in the sheets
We feel the rhythm, We've got the music on our side
If we go with 'em, I'll bet we'll have a wonderful ride
Your hands are cold, So maybe we could make some heat
Love is always born on a chance, So wrap around me and baby let's dance
Dancing in the sheets, Dancing in the sheets
Grab your coat and wave goodbye to your friends, I want to take you where the night never ends
I feel the need to sweep you off of your feet,
You and me, we should be dancing in the sheets, Dancing in the sheets
Grab your coat and wave goodbye to your friends, I want to take you where the night never ends
I feel the need to sweep you off of your feet,
You and me, we should be dancing in the sheets, Dancing in the sheets
Dancing in the sheets, Dancing in the sheets, Dancing in the sheets, Dancing in the sheets (Fade over Solo)

1,Are You Hearing What I Hear,Level 42,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/level-42/are-you-hearing-what-i-hear-chords-3180206,"Life is a game where nothing is real, Only you, only me
Right from the start we chase an ideal, Fooling you, fooling me
Are you hearing what I hear,      Are you feeling what I feel
You're still no. 1 but they're coming up to get you
Young eyes burning bright they can see a better way
You won't sleep tonight but that's the price you pay
Out of the past the words to a song, Calling you, calling me
Hope it will last but time pushes on, Pullling you, pulling me
Are you hearing what I hear,      Are you feeling what I feel
Every dream you had like balloons they burst around you,
So you're on the phone trying to conjure up your past
But the damage has been done, We're too far apart and strangers we've become
(with scat vocals)
And I wonder if it's true, Is the world a different place for me and you
Are you hearing what I hear,      Are you feeling what I feel
Are you hearing what I hear,      Are you feeling what I feel         (Bass Solo)
In our hearts we're still the same, But the worlds we chose to live in may have changed
And the damage has been done we trust no-one
We're too far apart and strangers we've become
Are you hearing what I hear,      Are you feeling what I feel
Are you hearing what I hear,      Are you feeling what I feel     (Fade)

We used to walk the streets, together.
We could be seen.
  Past shops where people knew us.
Yeah, people knew.

I've got to choose between tomorrow and yesterday.
 I can't stop to think about my life, here today.

All your life, you know.
 I get so you cannot stay and yet cannot go.

Hey,hey,hey I could find out where you've gone today.
I feel so unhappy.
  Streets seem so empty now.
I  want you, I want you with me
Maybe I'll find someone to get you, off my mind.
  Take me away from here and leave it, leave it all behind

And nobody seen your Johnny Dollar

On this noisy street
I've got to move
I've got the find me a quiet place
I can't get no sleep
On this noisy street
I've got to move
I've got the find me a quiet place
There's a man next door with a radio
And he plays it all thru the night
There's a couple in the apartment above my head
That don't do nothin but fuzz and fight
I can't get no sleep
On this noisy street
I've got to move
I've got the find me a quiet place
Tell me where do you go, when you got no doe?
There must be a way outta here
I got to find a peaceful mind
There must be a place - that I can find
Believe me when I tell you
There's a cat, that sneaks out on my window
And he miauws all the time
There's a drunk, that wakes me in the middle of the night
Singing ""Sweet Clementine""
I can't get no sleep

When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest,
In a big field of tall grass.
I laid there in the sun and felt it caressing my face.
As I fell asleep and dreamed,
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie,
And that I was the star of the movie.
This really blew my mind,
The fact that me an overfed long haired leaping gnome,
Should be the star of a Hollywood movie, hmmm.      1:28
There I was, ummm, I was taken to a place, the hall of the mountain kings
I stood high upon a mountain top, naked to the world
In front of every kind of girl, there was
Long one's, tall ones, short ones, brown ones, 
Black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones
Out of the middle, came a lady
She whispered in my ear something crazy, she said,        2:25
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl  2:41
I thought to myself, what could that mean?
Am I going crazy, or is this just a dream.
I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere
So it's all in my head
And then I heard her say one more time  3:12
Spill the wine, take that girl
Spill the wine, take that girl
Spill the wine, take that girl
Spill the wine, take that girl    3:28
I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared, but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine
In the other a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips
And just before she drank it, she said  4:08
Take the wine, take that girl
Spill the wine, take that girl
Spill the wine, take that girl, c’mon, c’mon,
Spill the wine, take that girl
Take that girl,          yeah!              4:27
It's on girl, all you gotta do is spill that wine
Spill that wine, let me feel, let me feel hot, yeah! yeah! Owww,

But if sometimes it seems not worth the battle
That's when you'll see

We keep reaching out for passion
No matter what the pain

It all fell into place
I found, what I was searching for
Shining in your face

The stormy weather
We promised we would
Stay together
We fell out of harmony
Singing Auld Lang Syne
But I've just found a
Four-leaf clover
So blue the sky all
Over me and you
We are a symphony-
A sunny valentine
Don't resign
Gimme what you got, babe
And I'll be satisfied
Gimme what you got, babe
And love will turn the tide
Gimme what you got babe...
And always sing keep loving me
For ever     more
We made a ship to sail the seasons
To conquer all the waves and reasons
Why we never touched the shore
Or found the treasure you adore-
Love's so fine
Ahead of us is stormy weather
We'll cuddle up and stay together
Finally a symphony (will sing)
And sing it one more time
Don't resign
Gimme what you got, babe
And I'll be satisfied
Gimme what you got, babe
And love will turn the tide
Gimme what you got babe...
And always sing keep loving me
For ever     more
Don't resign
Gimme what you got, babe
And I'll be satisfied
Gimme what you got, babe
And love will turn the tide
Gimme what you got babe...

On the wings they carry-
Searching for the high
They can never find-
Thinking love is blind.
Never mind.
They'll never see
The forest for the trees
'Til they turn to love.
Crying through the eyes
Of my own disguise-
Came to know the truth
From the lies
So, I hope you'll understand how
I'm another kind of man now
All I want is just to stand
Closer to your love.
Don't wanna climb a mountain.
Don't wanna swim a river.
I wanna feel the fire, power,
And all I can dream of.
Don't wanna climb a mountain.
Don't wanna swim a river.
I wanna move in

When the light stole in, it found me wide awake
Wasted from a sleepless night, I reach to touch your hair
Withdraw an empty hand, for you're no longer there
In between the silence, leaving is an empty space
Save the ticking of a clock
Whose hands are sweeping past its face
And I just don't want to be lonely, no, no
Night and day
But as I look around me, I just feel that way
For you only
I turn my hand to something that would clear my head
But I could not forget the parting words we shared
I opened up my mind to all the pictures I could trace
But I could not recall the contours of your face

I'll accept the blame""

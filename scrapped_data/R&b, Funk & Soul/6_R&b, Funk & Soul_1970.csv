0,The Same Love That Made Me Laugh,Bill Withers,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bill-withers/the-same-love-that-made-me-laugh-chords-3113147,"Your love is like a chunk of gold
Hard to gain, and hard to hold
Like a rose that's soft to touch
Love has gone, and it hurts so much
Well and Why
Must the same love that made me laugh
Make me cry?
Well now you think of love as sitting on a mountain
Think of it as being a great big rock
Won't you think before you started to roll it down
Because once you start it, you can't make it stop
I've given all I have to give
And if you don't want me
I don't want to live
Well and Why
Must the same love that made me laugh
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me lay in my pillow
Just cryin' like a weeping willow
Why you wanna make me cry?
Why you wanna make me cry?

Why you wanna make me mess in my pillow
I'm just cryin' like a weeping willow

I read your letters but you're not here.  They don't move me,

Two people vow to stay, in love as one, they say.
But all is changed with time; the future none can see.
The road you leave be-hind; a-head lies myste-ry.
But all is fair in love, I had to go a-way.
A writer takes his pen, to write the words a-gain;
That all in love is fair.
 All of fate's a chance; it's either good or bad,
I tossed my coin to say; in love with me you'd stay.
But all in war is so cold; you either win or lose.
When all is put a-way; the losing side I'll play.
But all is fair in love; I should have never left your side.
A writer takes his pen, to write the words a-gain;
That all in love is fair.

47,Harvest For The World,The Isley Brothers,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-isley-brothers/harvest-for-the-world-chords-1478191,"All babies together everyone a seed
Half of us are satisfied half of us in need 
Loves bountiful in us tarnished by our greed
oh, When will there be a harvest for the world
Yeah
A nation planted so concerned with gain
As the seasons come and go greater grows the pain
And far to many feeling the strain
Oh, When will there be a harvest for the world
Yeah
Gather every man gather every woman
Celebrate new life give thanks for your children
Gather every one gather all together
Overlooking love hoping life gets better
For the world 
Yeah
Dress me up for battle when all I want is peace
Those of us who pay the price come home with the least 
and nation after nation turning into beasts
Oh, When will there be a harvest for the world

I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away
Call me, baby, if you need a friend
I just wanna give you love
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
Reaching out to you, so take a chance
No matter where you go
You know you're not alone
I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away
Come along with me and don't be scared
I just wanna set you free
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
You and me can make it anywhere
For now, we can stay here for a while
Cause you know, I just wanna see you smile
No matter where you go
You know you're not alone
I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away
And when you're weak I'll be strong
I'm gonna keep holding on
Now don't you worry, it won't be long
Darling, and when you feel like hope is gone
Just run into my arms
I'm only one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one, I'm only one, one call away
I'll be there to save the day
Superman got nothing on me
I'm only one call away
I'm only one call away

It takes me all the way
I want you to staaaaaaaaayy

ooooohhhh cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
cause when you never seen the light  
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

Not a light, not a sound
I threw my voice into the dark
But the dark had no remark, 
Just repeated what I said
Claustrophobic at first
Struck by hunger and thirst
I stood up and looked around
There was nothing to be found
Just a world I couldn't see
And I heard whoo
I can't see you now
I'll find my way underground
Then my fear began to ease
From far away whispered a breeze
Telling me to move along
Move along there's nothing wrong
So I cornered my resolve
Took a breath and took a step
Encountered metal on my left
What a strange thing to find
Metal in this place of mine
Running lengthwise down the hall
And I heard whoo
Then a light shown through the black
I was standing on a track
That little light began to grow
There was no where I could go
Oh oh and the ground began to shake 
No time left to hit the brake
That little light was closing in
And suddenly I'm floating 
Oh I see you now, oh
You found me here underground

Couldn't go much higher
We find  God     and religions
  To bait us with salvation
But no one, no nobody
Can give you the power
To rise

Over hate

Over fear and into freedom

That's dripping down the walls
Of a dream that cannot breathe
In this harsh reality
Mass confusion spoon fed to the blind
Serves now to define our cold society

0,Unpretty (ver 2),TLC,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tlc/unpretty-chords-3817775,"  I wish I could tie you up in my shoes
  Make you feel unpretty too
  I was told I was beautiful
  But what does that mean to you?
  Look into the mirror, who's inside there?
  The one with the long hair
  Same old me again today, yeah
  My outsides look cool, my insides look blue
  Every time I think I'm through, it's because of you
  I tried different ways, but it's all the same
  At the end of the day I have myself to blame
  I'm just trippin'
  You can buy your hair if it won't grow
  You can fix your nose if he says so
  You can buy all the make-up
  That M.A.C. can make, but if
  You can't look inside you
  Find out who am I to
  Be in the position that made me feel
  So damn unpretty
  Never insecure until I met you, now I'm bein' stupid
  I used to be so cute to me, just a little bit skinny
  Why do I look to all these things to keep you happy?
  Maybe get rid of you and then I'll get back to me
  My outsides look cool, my insides look blue
  Every time I think I'm through, it's because of you
  I tried different ways, but it's all the same
  At the end of the day I have myself to blame
  Can't believe I'm trippin'
  You can buy your hair if it won't grow
  You can fix your nose if he says so
  You can buy all the make-up
  That M.A.C. can make, but if
  You can't look inside you
  Find out who am I to
  Be in the position that made me feel
  So damn unpretty
  You can buy your hair if it won't grow
  You can buy all the make-up
  That M.A.C. can make, but if
  You can't look inside you
  Find out who am I to
  Be in the position that made me feel
  So damn unpretty
  And make you feel unpretty too
  And make you feel unpretty
  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
  You can buy your hair if it won't grow

1,Give Me A Little More Time (ver 2),Gabrielle,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/gabrielle/give-me-a-little-more-time-chords-1125752,"You tried your best to show me
That you really cared
Said if there were days I was lonely
To call you - you'd be there
You tried your best convinced me
That you understand
And if I needed someone to hold on to
You wanted to be the man
Then I knew it was true
All the feelings that I had inside for you
I could not deny
Though many times I tried
Give me a little more time
I need to make up my mind
Cos you know I'm in two minds
I wanna be more than your friend

You've never let me down
I just don't know how I'd cope
Without you being around
Feelings have grown between us
Though friends we have been
Don't you think it complicates things
Or is it just me
Then I knew it was true
All the feelings that you had
I shared them too

  Fliegen Motten in das Licht genau wie du und ich.
   Irgendwie fängt irgendwann irgendwo die Zukunft an,
Ich warte nicht mehr lang.
   Liebe wird aus Mut gemacht,
Denk nicht lange nach wir fahr'n auf Feuerrädern
Richtung Zukunft durch die Nacht und ich sage:
  Gib mir die Hand, ich bau dir ein Schloss aus Sand,
Irgendwie, irgendwo, irgendwann.
   Die Zeit ist reif für ein wenig Zärtlichkeit,
Irgendwie, irgendwo, irgendwann, irgendwann, yes y'all

  Nur ein kurzer Augenblick, dann kehrt die Nacht zurück.

Ich brauch' Zweisamkeit wie'n Rider, dann scheiß' ich auf Tränen und Clayderman
Dann wird für den, der mit Duden feilscht, das Leben zart wie Putenfleisch,
Ja dann ist Schluß mit Einsamkeit, weil dann hat nie keiner Zeit,
Dann ist mir nix mehr einerlei, zu zweit kommt nach'm Job die Feinarbeit,
Lobbies gibt es viele für das Hobby namens Liebe,
Und mein Leben ist hart, warten auf die Gelegenheit wie Diebe,
Irgendwann ist sie da, irgendwo find' ich sie bestimmt,
Und die hat's dann in sich und zwar doppelt mit 'nem Kind
   Irgendwie fängt irgendwann irgendwo die Zukunft an,
Ich warte nicht mehr lang.

I thought I'd lost my way forever
Every dream and every plan
Every last chance slipped through my hand
And you smiled at me and it was over
Holding you tonight
Hold on tight
I try to say it ri-ght
And I guess sometimes the words don't come
And I wish I told you how you changed my life
And saved me with your love
I hope when all is said and done
You know I owe you one
Walk me down those streets again
Stop me right at the moment when
You stood there talking to a stranger
Tell me how you looked at me
And knew the very best that I could be
How did you see this happy ending
Standing by your side
I'm still surprised
I try to say it right
But I guess sometimes the words don't come

Still not quite sure what I'm going to say.
So bare with me please if I take up too much of your time.
See in this box is a ring for your oldest,
She's my everything and all that I know is,
It would be such a relief if I knew we were on the same side.
'Coz very soon I'm hoping that I,
Can marry your daughter,
And make her my wife. 
I want her to be the only girl that I love for the rest of my life,
And give her the best of me till the day that I die.
I'm gonna marry your princess and make her my queen. 
She'll be the most beautiful bride that I've ever seen. 
I can't wait to smile, 
When she walks down the aisle, 
On the arm of her father,
On the day that I marry your daughter.
She's been here every step since the day that we met. 
Scared to death to think of what would happen if she ever left.
So don't you ever worry about me ever treating her bad. 
I've got most of the vows done so far. 
So bring on the better or worst, and till death do us part
There's no doubt in my mind
It's time I'm ready to start.
I swear to you with all of my heart,
I'm gonna marry your daughter,
And make her my wife. 
I want her to be the only girl that I love for the rest of my life, 
And give her the best of me till the day that I die.

It'll be the last heart U'll ever break
I've taken all I can take
Baby, this heart wasn't made 2 break
How many times can you hurt me (hurt me)
Before your conscience makes you stop? (stop, stop, oh)
You made it all, why now desert me?
Baby, you know you can never cop (never cop), never cop
A body that'll do you like I do
You got 2 get your thing 2gether sister
I'm tired of being your fool
It'll be the last heart U'll ever break
I've taken all I can take
Baby, this heart wasn't made 2 break
Baby, if you break my heart one more time
It'll be the last heart U'll ever break
I've taken all I can take
Baby, this heart wasn't made 2 break

Я был как художник
Лепил из пластилина любовь
Которую как мне казалось
Я выдумал сам и она получалась
Цвета те которые мне не давались
Я взял их под сердцем
Они там валялись
О, нет, не пылились
Их просто не брали
Цвета едкой боли, любовной печали
Цвета цвета крови бегущей по венам
Цвета цвета крови бегущей по венам
Они так стонали, они так кричали
Я чувствовал телом.
Вроде того быть или не быть
Я хотел бы знать как
Вот в чем вопрос
Как бы мне тебя не убить
Не любить тебя как
Вот где ответ
Вот как битва покажет где боль
На рану как соль сука любовь
... сука любовь
Вот как бывает не зная той правды
Ты вылетел тело поставил на карту
Любовь та которая так не хотела
Остаться с тобой и она полетела
Туда где никто никогда не страдает
К тому кто ее никогда не познает
Любовь из пластмассы неведомой расы
Любовь цвета боли любовной печали
Цвета едкой боли, любовной печали
Цвета цвета крови бегущей по венам
Цвета цвета крови бегущей по венам
Они так стонали, они так кричали
Я чувствовал телом.

25,Alien Hold On To Your Dreams,Gil Scott-Heron,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/gil-scott-heron/alien-hold-on-to-your-dreams-chords-2917313,"Midnight near the border trying to cross the Rio Grande
Runnin' with coyotes to where the streets are paved with gold
You're diving underwater when you hear the helicopters
Knowing it's all been less than worthless if you run into patrols
Hiding in the shadows, so scared you want to scream
But you dare not make a sound if you want to hold on to your dreams
Hold on. Though it may not be a lot, you got to
Hold on. Cause you know it's all you got
No matter the consequences or the fear that grips your senses
You have got to hold on to your dreams
City of the Angels with its bright light fascination
Only adds to the confusion that your mind must now endure
The gringos take advantage when they know that you're illegal
But you avoid la policÃ­a like a plague that can't be cured
Playing la mordida you find out just what pollo means
But you dare not file complaints if you want to hold on to your dreams
Hold on. Though it may not be a lot, you got to
Hold on. Cause you know it's all you got
No matter the consequences or the fear that grips your senses
You have got to hold on to your dreams
Down at Western Union sending cash back to your family
Or drinking down cerveza where the lights are very low
Your mind may start to wander when you think about your village
Or the woman that you love so much who's still in Mexico
At just two bucks an hour there is little to redeem this life
Except that in your mind you're tryin' to hold on to your dreams
Hold on. Though it may not be a lot, you got to
Hold on. Cause you know it's all you got
No matter the consequences or the fear that grips your senses
You have got to hold on to your dreams

I kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side   
But then I spent so many nights just thinking how you've done me wrong 
And I grew strong, I learned how to get along...
And so you're back from outer space, 
I just walked in to find you here, with that sad look upon your face, 
I should have changed my freak en lock, I would have made you leave your key- 
If I’d have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me. 
Oh now go, walk out the door, 
Just turn around now, you're not welcome anymore.
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with desire? 
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh not I, I will survive,
Yeah, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll be alive. 
I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give, 
I will survive, I will survive, Yeah, yeah...
Down around the corner half a mile from here
without love where would you be now
without love
Though I saw miss lucy, down along the track
without love where would you be now
without love
with the feeling always central and the southern central freight
without love where would you be now
without love
without love where would you be now
without love
You better think (think)
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Think... let your mind go let yourself be free
Let's go back - let's go back
Let's go way on to way back when
I didn't even know you
You couldn't a been too much more than ten 
I ain't no psychiatrist
I ain't no doctor with degrees
But it don't take too much I.Q.
To see what you're doing to me
You better think (think)
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Yeah think (think - think)
Let your mind go let yourself be free
Oh freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom
Oh freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom
There ain't nothing you could ask
I could answer you but I won't 
But I was gonna change you I'm not if
You keep doing things I don't 
You better think (think)
Think about what you're tryin' to do to me
Oh-oh-oh think (think)
Let your mind go let yourself be free
People walking around everyday
Playin' games and taking scores
Tryin' to make other people lose their minds
Well be careful you don't lose yours
Oh think (think)
Think about what you're tryin' to do to me
Oh think (think)
Let your mind go let yourself be free
You need me

You turn my life around,

You're all that I've ever known,
You picked me up when I was down,  Sayin'
You're all that I've ever known,
You picked me up when I was down
and I hope that you feel the same way too,
Yes I pray that you do love me too!

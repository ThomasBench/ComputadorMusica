0,It Takes More,Jordin Sparks,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jordin-sparks/it-takes-more-chords-910066,"Tell me what happened this time
Made you come back again
I find out only see you when luck deserts you
If this is your idea of happiness
Then let's be clear
Those words of yours ain't working anymore
Cause I'm always giving
Here waiting while you're living
I need a new beginning
Oh, I'm not the girl I used to be with you
You think maybe that I'm just so easy
You can come in and out my life like you please
But baby no (uh-oh)
Don't you know it takes more
No more waiting for you to change
Don't you know that you bringing flowers
Won't stop the rain baby no, no (uh-oh)
Don't you know it takes more
I know you're busy so if you gotta go
Then go but don't forget to leave my heart
I stayed around for you but
You're no where to be found now
Once again here you are

1,No Parade,Jordin Sparks,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jordin-sparks/no-parade-chords-853363,"I'm already looking back
I'm already looking around
Where did we get off the track
I'm already waking up
Or have I been asleep too long
Losing you was hard enough
Not knowing anything was wrong
Changes come but, where'd they go
Just another day like any other,
Nothing in the sky said ""run for cover""
Just another reason,
Never thought it would end this way
There was no parade
No lights, flashing
No song to sing along the way
This story was supposed to last
You were never supposed to be
Just somebody in the past
Somebody I used to see
Trouble crept up from us
A warning never came in time
Before I knew it we were dust
Just left behind, left behind
Changes come but where'd they go
Just another day like any other,
Nothing in the sky said ""run for cover""
Just another reason,
Never thought it would end this way.
There was no parade
No lights flashing
No song to sing along the way
There was no parade
No waves crashing
There was no one else around the days
And after all the noise
I never heard a last goodbye
It was silent as a butterfly
There was no parade
No lights flashing
No song to sing along the way
There was no parade
No waves crashing
There was no one else around for days
There was no parade...

Baby, I believed every word
And you seemed so sincere, it was perfectly clear

And every little kiss      from your tender lips     G
Couldn't have been a lie
I fell heart over head    without a safety net       G

Was worried all the time
From waking up to laying down
I had no peace of mind
The world became a darkened place
A struggle without end
Although bitter times those were
The days that I began to understand
I was only a man
I grew up singing songs in church
With questions in my mind
Then turned my back and ran away
From God who gave me life
Then one night His presence felt
I wept and shook in it
I fell down and cried dear, Jesus
Rescue me again, I understand
I am only a man
What will it be now
Will you choose Me or keep swimming up stream now
Hearing you scream out
But here I am just take My hand and I’ll take out
All of the pain, and all of the fear
all of the fear
I’ll give You my burdens (I’ll give you peace)
All of my desires (I’ll give you what you need)
And what about these chains Lord (I’ll set you free)
But they’re so heavy    (Lay them at My feet)
I’ll lay them at Your feet

So if love remains we should be this crazy all this making me
I’ve been holding on
for way too long
I can’t go on
You've got 4 and 20 hours
Just one day to prove to me
That your love has got the power
To make me believe
Or take me where I wanna be
4        and     20      hours!
See every day I
I walk past my front door
And I’ve been wishing and hoping
That today is the day that you
You’re gonna, you’re gona smile in front of my face and tell me something
Something worth talking about
Tell me that you still love me and love aint gonna leave me

Evening's about to take control
The sky is painting pictures
Stirring up love bliss in our souls
The breeze carries the fragrance
Of the sweetest symphony
As it blows through your hair
Better can be nowhere
Our voices turn to whispers
Blending with rhythms of the night
The nightingales sing a love song
Glancing down at us in their flight
The moisture brings forth magic
That permeates the midnight air
To kiss the love we share
Are raindrops, passionate raindrops
The kind of rain that writes
They're so in love on our skin
Raindrops, that we hope don't stop
Cooling the red hot love that we are making
Raindrops, passionate raindrops
That brings out all the fire that we have within
Raindrops cover every spot
Right to the last drop
We want all of you and then
Let each drop of rain be a lifetime that our love won't end
Somewhere in our doing
Trying to make our bodies one
We fall prey to moon dreams
'Til awaken by the morning sun
Still disorientated
I feel something warm on my face
Coupled by your embrace
We gaze in awe and wonder
As if we can't believe it's so
Just that taste of heaven
Has got us longing for much more
We lie there impatient
Anxiously waiting for the sun to go in
And the clouds to burst again
Are raindrops, passionate raindrops
The kind of rain that writes
They're so in love on our skin
Raindrops, that we hope don't stop
Cooling the red hot love that we are making
Raindrops, passionate raindrops
That brings out all the fire that we have within
Raindrops cover every spot

I'll be your shel-ter  in  the rain

And haven't seen me any--where
Though when you were down
I lifted you up   from there
There isn't a thing you can ask of me
I won't do
Just you put your trust in me
My love will see you through
When the final candle's flickered out
""Why me"" is all you can think about
When all your joy has disappeared
Your future isn't clear
I'll be your com-fort through your pain
I'll be your shel-ter  in  the rain
When all the odds say there's no chance
Amidst the final dance
I'll be you comfort through your pain

Be your shelter, be your shelter in the rain

Better ask yourself why
Don't you wait until it's too late
Until something inside has died
When you're paralyzed, no direction at all
Found yourself way up high, now there's only space to fall
When you're losing even when you know the rules
Must be a game for fools
The first moment you hesitate
Better ask yourself why
Don't you wait until it's too late
Until something inside has died
Yeah it's easy down the line
To make a map of your lies
But you can't keep on keeping
The truth well disguised
Acting like it was alright
When it was all wrong
And you feel you've wasted so much time
Forever trying to make up your mind
Now it's clear you should have just moved on
Simply packed your bags and gone
Coz the first moment you hesitate
You can kiss those plans goodbye
Don't you wait until it's too late
Or something inside has died
If you're losing when you know
Yeah you know all the rules
........Must be playing 
A game for fools
........Congratulations 
Yeah you're winning 
The game 
For fools...

I remember the day you left
When you said that u would leave
But I see clearly now 
Over and over again
I think she's leaving
Ooh man she's leaving
I don't know what else to do
(I Can't go on not loving you)
Cause its all in my head
And I can't keep picturing you with him
Cause its on in my head
I replay it over and over again 
(Now that I've realizes that I'm going down
From all this pain you've put me through
Every time I close my eyes I lock it down
(I can't go on not loving you)
Cause its all in my head
And I can't keep picturing you with him
Cause its on in my head
I replay it over and over again
Cause its all in my head
And I can't keep picturing you with him
Cause its on in my head
I replay it over and over again
Over and Over again
Cause it's all in my head

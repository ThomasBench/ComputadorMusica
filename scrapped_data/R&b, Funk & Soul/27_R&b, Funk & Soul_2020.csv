  If you're not here with me
Sugar plums ain't half as sweet as you

  Got nothing on my list
Don't you know my only wish is to hold you on the 25th?
Season's here, lights appear
Spread the cheer everywhere, what a year it has been
Got me dreamin'
Oh, the place where we're safe
From the cold, your embrace
Oh, I just can't wait
To be home again
Catch the midnight flight
No more silent nights
I'll be by your side
Oh
Don't you know that Christmas would be incomplete
  If you're not here with me
Sugar plums ain't half as sweet as you
Someone go tell Santa I don't need no gifts

Fancy bags, Cadillacs
None of that, keep the tags

If you're listening
Catch the midnight flight
No more silent nights
It's been the longest time
Oh, yeah
Don't you know that Christmas would be incomplete
  If you're not here with me
Sugar plums ain't half as sweet as you

 We've been losing track of time
  Reaching higher heights
Only one thing on my mind
Only one thing on your mind
Let me touch you where you like it  Let me do it for ya
Give you all of my attention
Dive into that ocean of your love, oh
Let me show you just how much I want ya
Oh, drippin' down your body like gold
Slowly steamin' up the windows
My skin on your skin, again and again
Sweat for me, sweat for me
Oh, love it when I tear off your clothes
Slowly steamin' up the windows
My skin on your skin, again and again
Sweat for me, sweat for me
Damn, I could get lost in a heartbeat  Damn, I can't gеt over your body
Can't take my eyes off you baby
Let me love you, baby
Let me touch you where you like it  Let me do it for ya
Give you all of my attention
Dive into that ocean of your love, oh
Let me show you just how much I want ya

45,Nobodys Stopping You Now,Lake Street Dive,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lake-street-dive/nobodys-stopping-you-now-chords-3515972," Lay down girl, the summer's coming on
Take off your makeup, and take off your shoes
Trade in a dress for something oversized
And let your mind go wherever you choose
 Don't try to be a woman anymore
 Nobody's taught you how
   Skin your knees and throw punches in the air
 Nobody's stopping you now
It's okay to step away from the crowd
Nobody's stopping you now
 You're on the cusp of an obsession
Time is not on your side
All winter trying for perfection
But somehow you're never satisfied
 And that hunger'll last you for a lifetime
Until you learn how to set it down
   Sip the nectar from a honеysuckle bush
 'Cause nobody's stopping you now
It's okay to let thе real you out
Nobody's stopping you now
It's okay to let the real you out
Nobody's stopping you now
Nobody's stopping you now
   Lay down girl, and rest your weary head
I know you'll make it through somehow
   Dip your toes down deep into the riverbed
 'Cause nobody's stopping you now
It's okay to sing it right out loud
Nobody's stopping you now (Nobody's stopping you now, nobody's stopping you now)
It's okay to sing it right out loud (Nobody's stopping you now, nobody's stopping you now)
 Nobody's stopping you now  (Nobody's stopping you now, nobody's stopping you now)
Nobody's stopping you now (Nobody's stopping you now, nobody's stopping you now)

46,Calamity,Zayn,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/zayn/calamity-chords-3516158,"    Nostalgia, what a funny feelin'
I feel depleted from feelings I've been revealin'
    It's do or die, I'm not goin' willing
    But  when it's time, wrap in white  linen
I rap this, I say it for my sanity
Whatever the calamity, I did this for myself, fuck all of your fantasies
     You're a snake, fell off the ladder
     I prefer speakin' in analogies
     I’ve had enough of all this wet
     And I can't trust that you're my family
  I don't know what's next
The brain dead, that I never miss
My brain lives with the cannabis
Can I resist the dark abyss?
Leave a mark on this with no start, just exist
   My mind's in a prism shape
And in timеs like a prison state
   Therе's no right that I feel of late
There's no light if my view's at stake, and which life should I choose to take?
What's left, is it room or space?
   There  are rumors we have to face
I prefer sooner than after late
   I seen actors after BAFTA's be more straighy, I mean down the barrel
I hear 'em sing, it's the same carol
They're tryna sprint in a long run, Mo Farah
They're tryna fix when it's long gone, don't bother
There's no other, the thought shudders through most lovers
   I wanna bed you, but still sleep is death's cousin
   So two weeks is now four dozen
Years that pass by, can't press no rewind
Nobody, nobody-ayy is listenin' to me
Nobody, nobody-ayy is listenin'
Nobody, nobody-ayy is listenin' to me
Nobody, nobody-ayy is listenin' to me

Last time you saw me I was shaking
I will admit that I was lost
But all the punches that I've taking
They built me up while you got soft
I know you think it so
But we ain't done
You turn it up and I took the heat
You turn around and thought I was beat
   You let your guard down
   Forgot to watch out
Now I'm coming back around
Woooo
   I'm coming back
Woooo
Woooo
   I'm coming back
     Coming back around
You started before I was ready
I will admit you got the jump
But I've been working slow and steady
When you're burned out I'll burn you up
I know you think it so
But we ain't done
You turn it up and I took the heat
You turn around and thought I was beat
   You let your guard down
   Forgot to watch out
Now I'm coming back around
Woooo
   I'm coming back
Woooo
Woooo
   I'm coming back
     Coming back around
You turn it up and I took the heat
You turn around and thought I was beat
   You let your guard down
   Forgot to watch out
Now I'm coming back around
You turn it up and I took the heat
You turn around and thought I was beat
   You let your guard down
   Forgot to watch out
Now I'm coming back around
Woooo
   I'm coming back
Woooo      
   Coming back around
Woooo
   I'm coming back

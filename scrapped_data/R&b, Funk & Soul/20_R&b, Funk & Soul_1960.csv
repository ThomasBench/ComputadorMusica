Is to know you care for her
The way she cares for you
So why not promise her rubies
 even diamonds
She'd trade them all for
a plain golden wedding ring

And I can play hide-and-seek with my fears,
And live my days, instead of counting my years!

Since I met you baby
My whole life has changed
Everybody tells me that I'm not the same
I don't have nobody
To tell my troubles to
I don't have nobody

 'cause since I met you baby
All I need is you
Since I met you baby
I'm a happy man
Since I met you baby
Lord I'm a happy, happy man
I'm gonna try to please you in every way I can
From the first day you stepped into my life
You lit me up like I was a Christmas tree
That was just one of the good things you done for me
It changed all my thoughts to good thoughts
And showed me just how sweet love can really be
And darlin' you made a king out of me
And when we walk down the street together holdin' hands
I feel like I'm the ruler and the leader of my land
I know then that your the queen
But ohhh darlin' ever
Since I met you baby
I'm a happy man  yes I am
Since I met you baby
Lord I'm a happy, happy man
And everybody tells me I'm not the same
But I know who's to blame
Since I met you baby
My whole life has changed

Said adieu to love
Don't ever call again
For I must have you

And so I'm through with love
I've locked my heart
I'll keep my feelings there
I have stocked my heart
With icy frigidaire
And I mean to care for no one
Because I'm through with love
Why did you leave me
To think you could care
You didn't need me
For you had your share
Of slaves around you
To haunt you and swear
With deep emotion devotion to you
Goodbye to spring and all it meant to me
It can never bring the things that used to be
For I must have you or no one
And so I'm through with love

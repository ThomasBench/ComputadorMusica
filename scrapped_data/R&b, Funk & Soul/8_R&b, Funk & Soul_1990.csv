Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood to learn
What you think you know
There are times when I find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see
But at your best, you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know 
Let me know, let me know 
When you feel, what you feel
How hard for me to understand
Oh so many things have taken place
Before this love affair began
But if you feel, oh, like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
What I say I'm all about, all about
But at your best, you are love
You're a positive motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know

Pardon me for living, but this is my world too
I can't help that what's cool to us might be strange to you
Pardon me for breathing, can we borrow some of your air?
The problem with you and your kind is that you don't know love is there
Lay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor
Making love and music's the only things worth fighting for
We are the new power generation, we want to change the world
The only thing that's in our way is you
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas
We're sick and tired of you telling us what to do
Pardon me for thinking, but there's something under my hair
I bet you thought the lights were on but no one's living there
You think that if you tell enough lies they will see the truth?
I hope they bury your old ideas the same time they bury you
Lay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor
Making love and music's the only things worth fighting for
We are the new power generation, we want to change the world
The only thing that's in our way is you
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas
We're sick and tired of you telling us what to do
 We are the new
 We are the new, we are the new
Making love and music
     New power, we stand
Pardon us for caring, we didn't know it was against the rules (shout it out)
If we only want to love one another then tell me now who's the fool (tell me, tell me)
 No father, no mother, no sister, no brother, nobody can make me stop
Said if you didn't come to party child, I think you better get up of my block
Lay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor

We're sick and tired of you telling us what to do (If you'd just believe your whole world would change)

I can hang when you're around - But I’ll surely die if you're not there

Feel like I'm looking for my soul, like a poor man looking for gold - There're thieves in the temple tonight

Even if I wanted to I couldn't really truly cause my only friend is you – Come on
There're thieves in the temple tonight
Kicking me in my heart - Tearing me, tearing me, tearing me, tearing me all apart
Because me and you could've been a work of art (Thieves in the Temple)

Better than the thieves in the temple - in the temple tonight

     Everyone of us is made to weep
But we've been hurting one another

  Save me from the blast

    or maybe a fisherman out on the sea.
    Or maybe a carpenter building things,

    that the world would be different 'cause you were alive,
    that's what heaven stood still to proclaim.
3.  One day an angel said quietly,

    who would imagine a king?

Keeps her will alive

She's dying to survive

There is a stone in my heart
She lives a life she didn't choose
And it hurts like brand-new shoes

There is a woman in Somalia
The sun gives her no mercy
The same sky we lay under
Burns her to the bone
Long as afternoon shadows
It's gonna take her to get home
Each grain carefully wrapped up
Pearls for her little girl
Hallelujah

There is a stone in my heart
She lives in a world she didn't choose
And it hurts like brand-new shoes

 Takin' me places I ain't never been.
But now you're getting comfortable,
Ain't doin' those things you did no more,
You're slowly making me pay for things,
Your money should be handling.
 And now you ask to use my car, (car),
 Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank.
And you have the audacity, to even come and step to me,
 Ask to hold some money from me,
Un-til you get your cheque next week.

 Silly me, why haven't I found another?
 A baller, when times get hard, need someone to help me out,
 Instead of a scrub like you, who don't know what a man's about.
 Can you pay my bills? Can you pay my telephone bills?
Do you pay my automo' bills?
If you did then maybe we could just chill.
 I don't think you do, so, you and me are through.
 Now you've been maxin' out my card,
 Gave me bad credit, buyin' gifts with my own name.
Haven't paid the first bill, but you're steady headin' to the mall,
Goin' on shoppin' sprees, perpetratin',
To your friends that you be ballin'.
 And then you use my cell' phone,
 Callin' whoever that you think, at home.
And then when the bill comes, all of a sudden you be actin' dumb,
Don't know where none of these calls come from,
When your mama's number's here more than once.

What goes up  comes down you know
And I’ve been in   a better place
A year ago   at your love’s embrace
I never thought  that I could deserve you
I must admit that I    wasn’t like you
But given all the time  that I gave you
I can no longer wait    for approval
  I want you   to really want me too
Cause it’s   all in the value
  I need you   to really need me too
Cause it’s   all in the value
I’m a great man   and I know there’s greater
I try sell myself  but it doesn’t matter
And you’re a cool girl, they don’t come cooler
Don’t trade me in,   not for something newer
I never thought that I’d have the nerve to
Tell you my world   is crushed now without you
  I want you   to really want me too
Cause it’s   all in the value
  I need you   to really need me too
Cause it’s   all in the value 
   I can’t   wait to have you    back to me
   But you can’t wait  to see the   back of me
  What you   running   from,    why you running girl
  I want you   to really want me too
Cause it’s   all in the value
  I need you   to really need me too
Cause it’s   all in the value 
  I want you   to really want me too
Cause it’s   all in the value
  I need you   to really need me too

What if the world is a hopeless place

Can't look me straight in the eye
Too intimidated

You're making a fool of me now
How you got me so frustrated
When you ask me to be patient
Not convicting you with nothing

Our memories on my screen
Two lovers in this mystic dream
Baby come back to me, come back to me
Too much time on my phone
Baby do you still sleep alone?
Come back to me, come back to me
Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie, movie
On every screen
What would you realize
What you meant to me, it was a mystery
Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie, movie

What would you realize
What you meant to me, it was a mystery
I heard
That you moved somewhere far away
Is your number the same as before?
Can't ignore, the time
May have changed your ways
Does my record still hang on your wall?
Such a sentimental way to groove
I hope it still touches you
Baby come back to me, come back to me
It kills me to see you leave
So I came home and made this beat
Baby come back to me, come back to me
Remember me

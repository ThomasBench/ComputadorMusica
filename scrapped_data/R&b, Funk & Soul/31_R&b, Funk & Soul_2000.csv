The way you moving baby lets me know that it's gon' be right
I'm ready to go right now,    I'm ready to go right now
A 1, 2, 3 red light, I wanna see what your bed's like
But if I be your buddy, help you study, get your head right
I'm ready to go right now,    I'm ready to go right now
Do I have a girlfriend, technically no
If you'll be my girlfriend, then I'll make it so
  You'll be my only true lover,    no competition no other
Maybe it's just, the thrill of the chase, but
I've got a feeling that I'm winning this race!
Baby I'm gettin much closer,    I just need permission so give me the

hard like Medusa staring at me, I told her let's go
let's blow this lame nigga factory, she said what kind of

think you can get whatever you want 'cause you some kind of star, no I'm a
comet, I just want you woman, hey if I were
you it would be me that I'd go home with, 3, the one and
only, one thing you ain't considered, I heard you when you
told your girl ""Ooh, he can get it"", admit it
You did it, let's hop a cab and split it
I'm kidding, we both going to where you living
I got you giggling like a piglet, oh that's the ticket
I hope you're more like Anita Baker, than Robin
Givens,    No I don't know that lady so let me quit it
I'm just style-freeing, free-styling which I seldom do
This what I'm telling you, to the bed I'm nailing you
Like I been in jail for two, years and then they letttin' me loose
Green light,    give me just one night

Giving you all my heart

This time I’ll be a man
I can be all you need
This time is all of me
I hit the bar every night
Looking to score a good time
I’m left empty handed
I’m still alone in my mind
Now what will it take to feel right
Can I come see you tonight?
What can I do now?
Cause I need you back by my side
This time I want it all

Showing you all the cards
Giving you all my heart

This time I will give you more
I’m more mature, I’ll show you
Last time I didn’t know
I messed up and i let you go
I need you, don’t say no
Lying alone in this room
All that is missing is you
Won’t you come home?

So gimme' that toot-toot,
Lemme give you that beep-beep
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro,
Bouncin' on 24's
While they say on the radio
It's the remix to Ignition
Hot 'n fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body,
Got every man in here wishin',
Sippin' on Coke and rum,
I'm like, so what I'm drunk
It's the freakin' weekend,
Baby I'm about to have me some fun, singin'
 Bounce-bounce, bounce-bounce, bounce-bounce, bounce,
 Bounce-bounce, bounce...
Crystal poppin' in the stretch navigator,
We got food everywhere, as if the party was catered,
We got fellas to my left,
Honnies on my right,
We put 'em both together, we got drinkin' all night
And after the show it's the after party
And after the party, it's the hotel lobby
And 'round about 4, you gotta clear the lobby
Then take it to your room and **** somebody
 We be off in this Jeep
 Foggin' windows up
Blastin' the radio
In the back of my truck
Bouncin' up and down
Stroke it round and round
To the remix,
We just thuggin' it out.

You made it clear to me (You wasn't down for me)
Love made me blind, baby (But now I see)
You had things up your sleeve (Ho) don't even lie to me
  I even heard it from your family
How could you let somebody lay where I laid?
How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?
How could you teach him all the things I taught you?
How could you put him on to the ghetto Kama Sutra?
How could you put me in the back and give him the front seat?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?

  I damn near carried you, I could've married you

I know you're sick about (The way I found you out)
Go head and pack it out (I hope he's got room in his house)

Can't believe the ways you repaid me

    Sweet December song
The melody that  saved me
On those less than Silent Nights
When snow would fall upon my bed
Like sugar from Jesus
And take me to the day
She could always smile
The Virgin Child would always show you see
Just to save me (just to save me)
There was always Christmas time
To wipe the year away
I guess that Mum and Dad decided
That the war would have to wait
There was always Christmas time
Jesus came to stay
I could believe in peace on Earth
And I could watch TV all day
So I dreamed  of  Christmas
     Maybe since you've gone
I went a little.. crazy
God knows they can see the child
But the snow that falls upon my bed
That loving I needed
Falls every single day
For each and every child
The Virgin smiles for all to see
But you kept her from me
There was always Christmas time
To wipe the year away
I guess that Mum and Dad decided
That the war would have to wait
There was always Christmas time
Jesus came to stay
I could believe in peace on Earth
And I could watch TV all day

I'd have wanted to stay, but I got nothing to say.

I feel like writing you a letter, but that is not me; you know me.
Feel so fucking angry; don't wanna be re-minded of you.
But when I left my shit in your kitchen,
I said good-bye to your bedroom; it smelled of you.
Mr False Pretence; you don't make sense,
 I  just don't know you.

See far below the dust of conflict settles on the hill
Where there was no escape before

He brings the icy prophecies of war

To ragged armies of the field

To trigger that their fate is surely sealed

I wonder what he thinks of all the human traffic far below

The world will wait for you
And too much time is lost
On all the things we have to do
There’s nothing more important baby
Right now than you and me
So come a little closer darling
And turn the lights down low a key
And life could be so wonderful
A perfect home and a family
When you’re lying next to me
I’m everything I want to be
With the world and you tonight
     With the world and you tonight....
you are my world
With you my love
The world’s a bet­ter place
And every day with you
Will hold a treasured memory
Your embrace
Could steal me forever
And nothing else matters
When I hold you in my arms
And life could be so wonderful
A perfect home and a family       
‘Cos you are everything to me
I’m the lock and you’re the key
To the world and you tonight
You are my world
It's the world and you tonight...

Came into this world, daddy's little girl
And daddy made a soldier out of me (ooh-ooh ooh-ooh)
Daddy made me dance, and daddy held my hand (ooh-ooh ooh-ooh)
And daddy liked his whisky with his tea
And we rode motorcycles, blackjack, classic vinyl
Tough girl is what I had to be
He said take care of your mother, watch out for your sister
Oh that's when he gave to me
With his gun and his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh my daddy said shoot, oh my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot, oh my daddy said shoot
He held me in his arms, and he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone, here's what to do
When trouble comes to town, and men like me come around
Oh my daddy said shoot, oh my daddy said shoot
  (ooh-ooh ooh-ooh)
  (ooh-ooh ooh-ooh)
Daddy made me fight, it wasn't always right
But he said girl it's your second amendment (ooh-ooh ooh-ooh)
He always played it cool, but daddy was no fool
And right before he died he said remember
He said take care of your mother, watch out for your sister 
That's when daddy looked at me
With his gun and his head held high, he told me not to cry
Oh my daddy said shoot, oh my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle, he swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot, oh my daddy said shoot
Cause he held me in his arms, and he taught me to be strong
And he told me when he's gone, here's what to do
When trouble comes to town, and men like me come around
Oh my daddy said shoot, oh my daddy said shoot
My daddy warned me about men like you, he said baby girl 
He's playing you, he's playing you (ooh ooh-ooh-ooh)

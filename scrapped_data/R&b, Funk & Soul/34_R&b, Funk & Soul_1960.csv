But two bounces standing there wouldn't turn their head,
Pretending like they didn't see

Until he started to looking pale

Although you're with somebody new
Thought I'd drop a line to say
That I wish this happy day
Would find me beside you
Happy, happy birthday, baby
No I can't call you my baby (baby)
Seems like years ago we met
On a day I can't forget
'Cause that's when we fell in love
Do you remember     the names we had for each other
I was your pretty, you were my baby
How could we say goodbye
Hope I didn't spoil your birthday
I'm not asking like a lady
So I'll close this note to you
With good luck and wishes too
Happy, happy birthday, baby

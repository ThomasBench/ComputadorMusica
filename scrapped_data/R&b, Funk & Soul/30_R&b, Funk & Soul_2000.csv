0,Everything Fades Away,Mariah Carey,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/mariah-carey/everything-fades-away-chords-3115193,"Baby don't tell me you miss me, you love me
Don't whisper gently that you can't forget me
To---night, tonight
'Cause I've heard it all before
Just turn away, don't play that game
Baby I don't want to anymore
Let it all fade away
Don't you know that love is gone?
It's too late
Everything fades away
Nothing ever stays the same
Baby, no, no, no
Don't tell me you're sorry you hurt me
How many times can I give in?
How many battles can you win?
Oh, don't beg for mercy
Tonight, tonight
'Cause I can't take anymore
Just turn around, don't break me down
Baby I don't love you like before
Let it all fade away
Don't you know that love is gone?
It's too late, Woooh
Everything fades away
Nothing ever stays the same, baby
So hard for me to let you go
Don't leave me standing in the cold
Oh, baby give me one more chance
I know that we can make it last
Just let me love you one more time
Girl I don't wanna lose my mind
So hard for me to let you go
So hard for me to let you go
Let it all fade away (Mariah: why don't you?)
Love is gone, it's too late  (Mariah: The love is gone baby, it's too late)
Everything fades away
Nothing ever stays the same
Baby, nothing ever stays the same
Let it all fade away
Love is gone, it's too late (Mariah: The love is gone baby, it's too late)
Everything fades away (Mariah: Every, everything, fades away)
Nothing ever stays the same, baby
[Outro: Mariah Carey]
It only fades, it only fades
Only fades, it only fades
Baby don't tell me you miss me, you love me
Only fades, it only fades
Baby don't tell me you miss me, you love me
Only fades, it only fades
Baby don't tell me you miss me, you love me
Only fades, it only fades

1,Tick Tock,Lemar,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lemar/tick-tock-chords-3317489,"I gotta leave again
I don't wanna go
Things can be so lonely on the road
Could be a presidential suite
But nothing's ever like your bed at home
Especially when you're away from the one you love
It gets tough
Even though it hurts when I'm off at work
Looking at her picture soothes my pain
And for a moment I find myself right back at home again
I remember, through the ups and the downs of my day
I can say, my baby will be
Sitting, waiting, longing, holding on for me
While the time goes tick tock tick tock
Sitting, waiting, longing, holding on for me
While the time goes tick tock tick tock
She's gotta leave again
She don't wanna go
Hates to be away from me so long
She calls me everyday but
She can't kiss her baby on the phone
When we're hanging up
The tears start rolling down
But somehow
Even though she cries
She can find her smile
Cos she knows with me her heart is safe
Funny how time away, makes a loving heart grow fond again
She remembers, through the ups and downs of her day
She can say, oh that i'll be...
Sitting, waiting, longing, holding on for her
While the time goes tick tock tick tock
Sitting, waiting, longing, holding on for her
While the time goes tick tock tick tock
Oh, we remember, through the ups and downs of our days
We can say, oh that we'll be
Sitting, waiting, longing, holding on for love
While the time goes tick tock tick tock
Sitting, waiting, longing, holding on for love
Til she comes home

Said you were strong, protecting me

I kept my tears in - side 'cause I knew if I
Started I'd keep cryin' for the rest of my

Still a little protective 'bout the people

Thinking folk be trying to run my life

Vacant in - side, no one was there
Couldn't be real, had to keep quiet

After a while, I would just lie
You was dead wrong, said you was right
Did what I could just to survive
Flickering like a candle
Doing my best to handle sleep - ing with the enemy
Aware that he was smothering    every last part of me

26,I Wish You Well,Mariah Carey,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/mariah-carey/i-wish-you-well-chords-3277454,"This goes out to you and you and you
You know who you are
  When glory days turn to stormy nights
  You must have been so petrified
      Didn't you, didn't you feel so cold
  You against the world in a losing fight (a losing fight)
Captive of your demons inside
Owww
So you sought an enemy
(I'm not your enemy)
Like times before to mock ignorantly (he lives in you, you know it's true)
(But the Lord said love, love your enemy so just)
Take heed to the word it's time
Check Proverbs 19:29  Don't cry
I wish you well I wish you well I wish you well
I truly wanted solidarity Still wearing my blinders back then
(So much I didn't see)
I weep for what I dreamed we all could be I'll keep you in prayer 'till the end
 (Woah still bruised)
Still bruised, still walk on eggshells
Same frightened child, hide to protect myself
(Can't believe I still need to protect myself from you)
But you can't manipulate me like before
Examine first John chapter four verse four
And I wish you well I wish you well I wish you well
Be strong in the Lord and power of His might
If my shows of gratitude are minuscule
Inside your mind, sor---ry
(I'm so sorry, please forgive me)
(vocal High note Eb in the 6 octave)
           Maybe when you're cursing me
    You don't feel so incomplete
But we've all made mistakes
Felt the guilt and self-hate
   I know you've been there for me plenty
   Maybe still got love for me
But let him without sin cast the first stone brethren (But who)
But who remains standing then
Not you not I see Philippians 4:9
(Put that it into practice)
So I wish you well-he-hal
     I wish you well
I wish you well
(He who the Son sets free is free indeed)
Nooo-ahooo-weapon formed against me shall prosper
     Surely God is my salvation
I will trust and not be afraid
The Lord, the Lord is my salvation
I will trust in Him
Yes, I know that I know that I know that I know
But I have had God's help to this very day
And so I stand here and testify
So the more you curse me
The more you're blessing me
The Word said it
Love your enemies
 Do good to those who curse you
Pray-eee for those who mistreat you
Psalms 129:2
They have greatly opressed me from my youth
But they have not gained victory over me
I wish you well

  I see you clearly jump down off the step
  The twinkling in your eyes
  Makes me wonder if I'm dead or alive
  And I, I just wait
  How many clues do you need me to leave you?
  I feel like I leave 'em all the time
  Spending days together, I just
  Can't help wondering when you'll be mine
If I could hold your hand, yes I would
Be with you every day, if I could
But my lips are sealed, like they should
But tick tock, tick tock, tick tock
I'm waiting
  Behind my smile lies uncertainty
  If you choose a girl, will she be me?
  I try to keep my composure today
  If I wish too hard, though you might wish away
  So I, I just wait
  How many clues do you need me to leave you?
  I feel like I leave 'em all the time
  Spending days together, I just
  Can't help wondering when you'll be mine
If I could hold your hand, yes I would
Be with you every day, if I could
But my lips are sealed, like they should
But tick tock, tick tock, tick tock
I'm waiting
I had my face in shadows
So you won't disturb my dreams
I look on you from a far point
We're beautiful, it seems
But I inch a little closer
And that's all I want to take
You disintegrate before me
And from my lovely sleep I wake
If I could hold your hand, yes I would
Be with you every day, if I could
But my lips are sealed, like they should
'Cause time, time, time is ticking away
If I could hold your hand, yes I would
Be with you every day, if I could

Tell me I'm forgiven
He calls; don't know how I fell under his spell
Lately, I've been driven
He smiles an enchantment

I'm mesmerized
This love is like a potion in disguise
I'd tightrope walk with a blindfold on my eyes
I can't escape, or so it seems
I'd run away; he's in my dreams
He possesses an enchantment
Tell me I'm forgiven
He calls; don't know how I fell under his spell
Lately, I've been driven
He smiles an enchantment
It's the kind of sleepwalk that never ends
A type of loan with no dividends
It's a parlor game where you're giving chase
Guess it could be called an acquired taste
I know, he knows, he calls, I go, I know
This could be an enchantment
Why don't you tell me I'm forgiven?

37,Reflections Care Enough,Mariah Carey,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/mariah-carey/reflections-care-enough-chords-3315194,"Reflections of your love have come to wither
I thought I'd done my best to memorize
A picture fades of you and I together
I haven't come to terms with how we said goodbye
Did you really   care, care  at all for me?
Did you really   care, did you care at all for me?
A displaced little girl wept years in silence
And whispered wishes you’d materialize
She pressed on night and day to keep on living
And tried so many ways to keep her soul alive
Did you really   care, care enough for me?
Did you really   care, did you care at all for me?
If I'm  not quite  good enough
Or somehow undeserving of a mother's love
  You  could have had the decency to give me up
Before you gave me life
Don't you even care, just the slightest little bit, for me?
'Cause I really need to feel you cared
Even once upon a time for me
I need to believe, in my heart of heart of hearts, you cared for me
I need to understand why you left me there so helplessly
Don't you even    care, care at all for me?
Reflections of your love have come to wither
I thought I'd done my best to memorize...

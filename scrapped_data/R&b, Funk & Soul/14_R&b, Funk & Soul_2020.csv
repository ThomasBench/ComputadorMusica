Promise you'll find love again
Yeah, it will be alright
Why are you so hard on yourself?
Yeah, why you gotta try so hard?
Counting calories and carbs
Another trip across the world
I go so hard tryna
Make you feel just like a queen
You don't need a camera to make a scene
You were born like that, no Maybelline
When you first wake up, you're bad to me
Pop another Addy, no sleep tonight
Can't push the wheel slow, I'm speedin' right
Over to the crib 'cause we need to slide
But you take so long makin' up your mind
All black dress, do your back
You leave ten times, I'll take you back
Why you wanna look like someone else?
Why are you so hard on yourself?
I can see you're struggling
Promise you'll find love again
Yeah, it will be alright
Why are you so hard on yourself?
Try not to fall apart
You're perfect just the way you are
It will be alright
Why are you so hard on yourself?
Why you gotta compare our lives
To pics you see on your timeline?
Another shot of Hennessy
I try so hard not to
Act like a dick when I'm 'round your friends
Mood swings up and down again
Hollywood Hills where we play pretend
No one happy, but they're good at fakin' it
Pop up in the party, show face tonight
I don't really smoke, but I need the vibes
You love to get high, she need the flights
Standin' so high, swear she could fly
Why you wanna be like someone else?
Why are you so hard on yourself?
I can see you're struggling (Yeah)
Promise you'll find love again

Why are you so hard on yourself? (Oh)
Girl, when you look in a mirror
I hope you see what I see clearer, yeah
All that I want you to know
Is that you're perfect the way that you are
Oh, the way you are (Oh, the way you are)

It's too perfect, tell me, am I dreamin'?
You give being in love a whole new meaning
Wouldn't mind it if you stole me for the weekend
We could go to our spot
Possibilities are endless, baby, I got
No plans, no plans, no plans, no plans
You could take me anywhere you wanna go, just
Please
Don't take me home
I could stay right here forever
Anywhere with you is better
Just don't take me home
Tonight is all we got, my lover
And I don't want it to be over
Don't want to be alone
Don't take me home
We could drive around until we get lost
Dancin' in the grass with our shoes off
I try to play you something on guitar
But lookin' at you got me blushin' so hard
Layin' in your truck bed
Cotton candy sunset
This could be our new spot

Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy

Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one for the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched

Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah

Did you even notice I was here?
If I left the party would you even care?
So I guess I just was never what you wanted
Wasted all my money throwing pennies in a fountain
It’s not easy tryna tell you how I feel

“Don’t be sad”
“The sun is shining”
“just be happy”
“why you whining?”
Waiting room is getting crowded
“You’re not special you’re not special”
I’m sorry, Sorry that you just don’t understand
You always tell me that it’s only in my head
Then whys the Internet feel like my only friend
The only one that knows that this isn’t pretend
Everyones in therapy wouldn’t go if you were there for me
Never should’ve told you how I felt

Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
In a whole 'nother life, there was this boy that I knew
He made me feel like a woman
We were young and silly fools
Anyway, he was in a band
Wrote love songs about me
I wasn't crazy 'bout the words, but the melodies were sweet
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Every time we go dancing, I see his straying eyes
Gave him too many chances, push my gears too many times
Anyway, he start acting dumb, then I'll be on my way to leave
But I stopped in the tracks when I heard this melody
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
He used to sing me sweet melodies
He played me, made me believe it was real love
Sang me sweet melodies
But the day he did me wrong
The song couldn't go on and on and on
He used to sing me sweet melodies
He played me, made me believe it was real love
Sang me sweet melodies
But the day he did me wrong
The song couldn't go on and on and on
He would lie, he would cheat, over syncopated beats
I was just his tiny dancer, he had control of my feet
Yes when he came along, that's when I lost the groove
There was no song in the world
To sing along or make me move
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-roo-doo-roo (It was,)
Doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-roo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo (Oh)
He used to sing me sweet melodies (Oh-woah)

Slow down, breathe,
What's in the ground beneath your feet?
Get off that screen and let it go,
A blue check screams,
I always whisper what you  want,
And it was right here all along.
'Cause I found something with a taste you can't describe,
You take it in and all your roots get intertwined,
And every time,
I call you back, I know you're fine,
I know you're fine.
There's no cancer in the water,
It's not an answer or a dream,
Your mother and your father,
Would rather blow it all on ginger tea,
More to offer than to feed, breathe,
And you're ready for it,
I think it's for the best you leave this town,
You're ready for this, now.
Breathe,
Slow down, breathe.
Terrified when I'm 'boutta be brave,
Since Danny hit me, I've been killing the game,
Power to you if you're riding the wave,
Could give a fuck about no money or fame,
Take you and your girl right back to my place,
'Cause man or woman, I'ma fuck you the same,
Picking me up when she back in my state,
A quick flight to NYC for some cake,
Touchdown, 50 came in the clutch,
My boy's bound for something bigger than us,
Cuts deep like a knife, that's the shit you can feel,
My mama love me and her willpower steel,
Ex's heart 'boutta beat out my chest,
I'm sorry 'bout me and I wish you the best,
I just wanna fuck, the marijuana,
Get me scared of trauma,
But I'm gon' be okay,
Good sex, every day,
Great sex like ain't grey this is fate,
Fill my plate with acid, salad, and breaks,
I get drunk and he gets stupid high,
I just chill 'cause I don't wanna try,

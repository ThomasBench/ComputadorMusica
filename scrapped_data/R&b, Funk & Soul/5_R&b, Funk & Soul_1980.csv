What I want you've got
And it might be hard to handle
Like the flame that burns the candle
The candle feeds the flame, yeah, yeah
What I've got's full stock
Of thoughts and dreams that scatter
Then you pull them all together
And how I can't explain
Well, well you (Ooh-ho, hoo-ooh, ooh-oo)
You make my dreams come true (You-hoo, you, you-hoo, hoo, you, hoo)
Well, well, well you (You-hoo, hoo-hoo-ooh)
You make my dreams come true (You-hoo, you, you-hoo, hoo, you, hoo)
On a night when bad dreams become a screamer
When they're messin' with the dreamer
I can laugh it in the face
Twist and shout my way out
And wrap yourself around me
'Cos I ain't the way you found me
And I'll never be the same
Well, 'cos you (Ooh-ho, hoo-ooh, ooh-oo)
You make my dreams come true (You-hoo, you, you-hoo, hoo, you, hoo)
Well, well, well you(You-hoo, hoo-hoo-ooh)
You make my dreams come true (You-hoo, you, you-hoo, hoo, you, hoo)
Listen to this
I'm down on my daydream
Oh, that sleepwalk should be over by now
I know
'Bout you
Yeah, yeah
You make my dreams come true (You-hoo, you, you-hoo, hoo, you, hoo)
I've been waiting for, waiting for you, girl(You-hoo, hoo-hoo-ooh)
You make my dreams come true(You-hoo, you, you-hoo, hoo, you, hoo)

Now I'm the kinda guy,
Who don't be-lieve that chivalry is dead, no.
'Cos I believe a woman,
Should be treated with the utmost re-spect, mmm-hmm...
 Don't be afraid; don't turn and walk a-way,
I wanna get to know ya, well.
 Don't be ashamed; don't say that love's to blame,
Just come and look me over.
(You'll find a heart), you'll find a heart,
That you've always been lookin' for.
How could anybody ask for much more? Woo-hoo.
Now I like openin' doors, pickin' up her hanky off the floor;
 Treat her like a lady, (treat her like lady).
Light her cigarette if she smokes, even, (help her with her coat);
 Treat her like a lady, (treat her like lady).
In this world of liberation, it's so easy to for-get, mmm...
That it's so nice to have a man around, to lend a helping hand,
You can bet, bet you can, baby.
 When I was young, my mama used to say;
""Boy, a woman's like a flower, with love on her, you shower"".
 Ever since that day, her words never went a-way,
I always will remember, to treat my baby tender.
(You'll find a heart), you'll find a heart,
That you've always been lookin' for.
How could anybody ask for much more? Woo-hoo.

 Treat her like a lady, (treat her like lady).

And the sun begins to fade
  Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
 I've done alright up     til now
It's the light of day that shows me   how
And when the night falls
Loneliness calls
  Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
  I wanna feel the heat with somebody
  Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
  Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
  I wanna feel the heat with somebody
  Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who  loves me
       I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
 Sooner or later, the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
 I need a man who'll take   a  chance
On a love that burns hot enough to   last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
  Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
  I wanna feel the heat with somebody
  Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
  Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
  I wanna feel the heat with somebody
  Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who  loves me
Somebody who,     somebody who
  Somebody who loves me
Somebody who,     somebody who
  To hold me in his arms, oh
I need a man who'll take   a  chance
On a love that burns hot enough to   last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
  Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
  I wanna feel the heat with somebody
   Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
      With somebody who loves me
  Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
  I wanna feel the heat with somebody

and the answers are all up to me.

Then in that one moment of time,
I will feel, I will feel  eternity.

Teach me to harvest, I want you to grow in my hand

let's say that we won't toil in vain
If we pull together 
we'll never fall apart again

For a warm injection
Is all I need to calm the pain

Good morning, my darling, I'm telling you this
to let you know that I'm sorry you're sick
Though tears of sorrow won't do you no good,
I'd be your doctor if only I could. 
What do want from the liquor store?
Something sour or something sweet?
I'll buy all that your belly can hold.
You can be sure you won't suffer no more. 
I'd swim the ocean or the deepest canal
to get to you darling just to make you well.
There's no place on Earth that I wouldn't hasten to go
to cool the fever; this I want you to know.
What do want from the liquor store?
Something sour or something sweet?
I'll buy all that your belly can hold.
You can be sure you won't suffer no more. 
If only the doctor would hurry and show
there's quite a few places I know we could go.
I was ok but these words from you
stating you're sick made me sick, too.
What do want from the liquor store?
Something sour or something sweet?
I'll buy all that your belly can hold.
You can be sure you won't suffer no more. 
Promise me darling that you won't die;
I'll get all the medicine that money can buy.
Stick with me baby, hold on and fight
take a good rest I won't prolong the flight
What do want from the liquor store?
Something sour or something sweet?
I'll buy all that your belly can hold.
You can be sure you won't suffer no more. 
What do want from the liquor store?
Something sour or something sweet?

A September morning, With the sun and the smell of the clover...
Down by the gates We sit and we watch all our friends go by... 
And pretend we don't hear the bell, That rings through the summer sky.
I was happy with the kisses she gave me, 
It's just that happy was all she made me... 
Happy that was... Until I saw you...
Heartbeat, heartbeat, Why do you fail me now? 
You hurt me...desert me, In my darkest hour... 
Heartbeat, heartbeat, Why do you keep me here? 
How could I help but admire her beauty? 
Standing on the line between desire and duty... 
Heartbeat Heartbeat... It will end in tears...
I need a lover, But loves such a dangerous place to be... 
Oh, if we were meant for each other, Then why don't you answer me?
Don't keep me waiting, You know that I long to be by your side... 
We could even be together, Tonight...
I was happy with the kisses she gave me... 
Now there's nothing on Earth that can save me... 
Why should I care? I can't have you....
Heartbeat, heartbeat, Why do you fail me now? 
You hurt me...desert me, In my darkest hour...

Hey!, if we can solve any problem
Then why do we lose so many tears
Oh, and so you go again
When the leading man appears
Always the same thing
Can't you see, we've got everything goin' on and on and on
Every time you go away you take a piece of me with you
Every time you go away you take a piece of me with you
Go on and go free, yeah
Maybe you're too close to see
I can feel your body move
It doesn't mean that much to me
I can't go on sayin' the same thing
Just can't you see, we've got everything do you even know we know
Every time you go away you take a piece of me with you, oh
Every time you go away you take a piece of me with you
I can't go on sayin' the same thing
'Cause baby, cantcha see, we've got everything goin' on and on and on
Every time you go away you take a piece of me with you, oh
Every time you go away you take a piece of me with you

 Let's take a walk together near the ocean shore
    Hand in hand, you and I
 Let's cherish every moment we have been given
   For time is passing by
    I often pray before I lay down by your side
 If you receive your calling before I awake
 Could I make it through the night
 Che-rish the love  we have
 We should cherish the life we live (oh)
 Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love
 The world is always changing, nothing stays the same
    But love will stand the test of time
 The next life that we live in remains to be seen
    Will you be by my side
    I often pray before I lay down by your side
 And if you receive your calling before I awake
 Could I make it through the night
 Che-rish the love  we have (mmm, yeah)
 We should cherish the life we live (baby, yeah)
 Cherish the love (oh), cherish the life (yes I do), cherish the love (Ohh)
 Che-rish the love  we have
 For  as  long as we both shall live
 Cherish the love, cherish the life (baby), cherish the love
    Cherish the love
 Cherish the life
 Che-rish the love  we have
 We should cherish the life we live
 Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love
 Che - rish the love we  have
 For  as  long as we both shall live (oooh)
 Cherish the love (ohh), cherish the life (yes I do), cherish the love (ohh)
 Che - rish the love   we have
 Che-rish the love  we have
 For  as  long as we both shall live
 Cherish the love, cherish the life (baby), cherish the love

And that's one thing I'm proud to say I found in you

And there's nothing in this world to come between me and you

0,Being With You,Smokey Robinson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/smokey-robinson/being-with-you-chords-634848,"I don't care what they think about me
I don't care what they say
I don't care what they think if you're leaving
I'm gonna beg you to stay
I don't care if they start to avoid me
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else
But being with you being with you
Honey don't go don't leave this scene
Be out of the picture and off of the screen
Don't let them say we told you so
Don't tell me you love me and then let me go
I heard the warning voice
From friends and my relations
They tell me all about your heart-break reputation
I don't care what they think about me
I don't care what they say
I don't care what they think if you're leaving
I'm gonna beg you to stay
I don't care if they start to avoid me
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else
But being with you being with you
People can change they always do
Haven't they noticed the changes in you
Or can it be that like love I am blind
Do I want it so much 'til it's all in my mind
One thing I know for sure
Is really really real
I never felt before the way you make me feel
I don't care what they think about me
I don't care what they say
I don't care what they think if you're leaving
I'm gonna beg you to stay
I don't care if they start to avoid me
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else
But being with you being with you

1,Thriller,Michael Jackson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/michael-jackson/thriller-chords-212734,"It's close to midnight, and something evil's, lurking in the dark.
Under the moonlight, you see a sight, that almost stops your heart.
You try to scream, but terror takes the sound, before you make it.
You start to freeze, as horror looks you right between the eyes;
You're para-lyzed.
'Cos this is; Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike.
You know it's; Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
You're fighting for your life, inside a killer, Thriller, to-night.
You hear the door slam, and realise there's nowhere left to run.
You feel the cold hand, and wonder if you'll ever see the sun.
You close your eyes, and hope that this is just imagi-nation.
But all the while, you hear the creature creepin' up be-hind;
You're out of time.
'Cos this is; Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
There ain't no second chance to kill the thing with forty eyes, girl.
 Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
You're fighting for your life, inside a killer, Thriller, to-night.
 Night creatures call and the dead start to walk in their masquerade.
 There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien, this time;
 This is the end of your life.
 They're out to get you; there's demons closing in on every side.
They will pos-sess you; unless you change the number on your dial.
Now is the time, for you and I to cuddle close to-gether.
All through the night, I'll save you from the terror on the screen;
I'll make you see...
That this is; Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
'Cos I can thrill you more than any ghost would dare try.
 Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
So let me hold you tight, and share a killer,
 Diller, chiller, Thriller here to-night.
That this is; Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
'Cos I can thrill you more than any ghost would dare try.
 Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
So let me hold you tight, and share a killer, thriller, ow!
 ...I'm gonna thrill you tonight.
 Darkness falls across the land, the midnight hour is close at hand.
 Creatures crawl in search of blood, to terrorise your neighbourhood.
 And whosoever shall be found, without the soul for getting down,
Must stand and face the Hounds of Hell and rot inside a corpse's shell.
The foulest stench is in the air; the funk of forty thousand years,
And grizzy ghouls from every tomb, are closing in to seal your doom.
 And though you fight to stay alive; your body starts to shiver,
For no mere mortal can resist, the evil of The Thriller

water in the milk from a hole in the roof where the rain came through.
What can you do? Ahah.
Tears from your little sister, crying because she doesn't have a dress
without a patch for the party to go.
But you know, she'll get by.
Cause she's living in the love of the common people,
smiles from the heart of a family man.
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to,
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can. And she can.
It's a good thing you don't have bus fare.                                                                
and you'd lose it in the snow on the ground.
You gotta walk into town, to find a job.
Trying to keep your hands warm,                                                                
and chill you to the bone.
So now you better go home where it's warm.
Where you can live in the love of the common people,
smiles from the heart of a family man.
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to,
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can. And she can.
(eight bars)
Living on a dream ain't easy.
But the closer the knit, the tighter the fit, and the chills stay away.
Just take them in stride for family pride.
You know that faith is your foundation with a whole lotta love
and a warm conversation, but don't forget to pray.
Just making it strong, where you belong.
And we're living in the love of the common people,
smiles from the heart of a family man.
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to,
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can. And she can.
Yes we're living in the love of the common people,
smiles from the heart of a family man.
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to,

Ooh love, wakes me up every day
And I thought no one could ever make me feel this way
It fills me up
Every time I hear her say
She's still in love
And no one could take her love away
I wanna be loved

It's better by far

And go no matter how far
To the one you love,  To - love
And I mean all these words I say
You don't have to guess what's going on inside my head
Just try to know
All the things that our hearts say
Listen to love
And always get love to lead the way
Whenever you love
There's nothing better than love
What in the world could you ever be thinking of?
It's better by far
So let yourself reach for that star
And go no matter how far
To the one you love

You know for love I would go anywhere
(For love) I would go there
(For love, for love)
For love to the ends of nowhere
 It's for her love, and for her love I would go
I would go, and I would love
 To just spend all my time
With a girl who makes me feel her love is mine

Who would only dream of me
She'd be in love
Just 'cause she'd want to be
She'd want to be loved

 I don't need no dreams, when I'm by your side;
 Every moment takes me, to para-dise.
Darlin'... let me hold you;
 Warm you in my arms, and melt your fears a-way.
 Show you...
 All the magic that a perfect love can make; I need you night and day.
So baby, be mine, (baby, you gotta be mine),
And girl, I'll give you all I got to give.
So baby, be my girl, (all the time),
And we can share this ecstasy, as long as we believe, in love.
 I won't give you reason, to change your mind,
 You are all the future, that I de-sire.

 I promise you now; that the dawn will be different.
 Lady, can't you see, that Heaven's just begun?
 It's livin' here, inside our hearts.
 There'll be no more mountains, for us to climb,
 This will be a love, lasting for all time.
Girl... you got to hold me,
 We can touch the sky and light the darkest day.

Every night, she walks right in my dreams,
Since I met her from the start.
I'm so proud I am the only one, who is special in her heart.
The girl is mine; ...the doggone girl is mine.
 I know she's mine; ...because the doggone girl is mine.
I don't understand the way you think, saying that she's yours, not mine,
Sending roses and your silly dreams; really just a waste of time.
Because she's mine; ...the doggone girl is mine.
 Don't waste your time, ...because the doggone girl is mine.
I love you more than he, (take you anywhere),
But I love you endlessly, (loving we will share).
So come and go with me, to one town.
But we, both cannot have her, so it's, one or the other.
And one, day you'll dis-cover; that she's my girl for-ever and ever.
Don't build your hopes, to be let down, 'cos I really feel it's time.
I know she'll tell you; I'm the one for her, 'cos she said I blow her mind.
The girl is mine; ...the doggone girl is mine.
 Don't waste your time, ...because the doggone girl is mine.
She's mine, (she's mine), no, no, no, she's mine.
The girl is mine, (the girl is mine),
The girl is mine, (the girl is mine).
The girl is mine, (mine, mine),
Yep, she's mine, (mine, mine).
The girl is mine, (mine, mine),
Yep, she's mine, (mine, mine).
 Don't waste your time, ...because the doggone girl is mine.
The girl is mine...
 Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay?
Paul, I think, I told you; I'm a lover, not a fighter.
I've heard it all be-fore, Michael,
She told me that I'm her forever lover, you know, don't you remember?
Well, after loving me, she said she couldn't love another.
 Yes, she said it; you keep dreaming.
 (Mine, mine), the girl is mine, (mine, mine).
 (Mine, mine), the girl is mine, (mine, mine).
It's close to midnight, and something evil's, lurking in the dark.
Under the moonlight, you see a sight, that almost stops your heart.
You try to scream, but terror takes the sound, before you make it.
You start to freeze, as horror looks you right between the eyes;
You're para-lyzed.
'Cos this is; Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike.
You know it's; Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
You're fighting for your life, inside a killer, Thriller, to-night.
You hear the door slam, and realise there's nowhere left to run.
You feel the cold hand, and wonder if you'll ever see the sun.
You close your eyes, and hope that this is just imagi-nation.
But all the while, you hear the creature creepin' up be-hind;
You're out of time.
'Cos this is; Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
There ain't no second chance to kill the thing with forty eyes, girl.
 Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
You're fighting for your life, inside a killer, Thriller, to-night.
 Night creatures call and the dead start to walk in their masquerade.
 There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien, this time;
 This is the end of your life.
 They're out to get you; there's demons closing in on every side.
They will pos-sess you; unless you change the number on your dial.
Now is the time, for you and I to cuddle close to-gether.
All through the night, I'll save you from the terror on the screen;
I'll make you see...
That this is; Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
'Cos I can thrill you more than any ghost would dare try.
 Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
So let me hold you tight, and share a killer,
 Diller, chiller, Thriller here to-night.
That this is; Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
'Cos I can thrill you more than any ghost would dare try.
 Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
So let me hold you tight, and share a killer, thriller, ow!
 ...I'm gonna thrill you tonight.
 Darkness falls across the land, the midnight hour is close at hand.
 Creatures crawl in search of blood, to terrorise your neighbourhood.
 And whosoever shall be found, without the soul for getting down,
Must stand and face the Hounds of Hell and rot inside a corpse's shell.
The foulest stench is in the air; the funk of forty thousand years,
And grizzy ghouls from every tomb, are closing in to seal your doom.
 And though you fight to stay alive; your body starts to shiver,
For no mere mortal can resist, the evil of The Thriller...
 They told him; don't you ever come around here;
Don't wanna see your face; you better disappear.
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear,
So beat it, just beat it.
 You better run, you better do what you can;
Don't wanna see no blood; don't be a macho man.
You wanna be tough; better do what you can,
So beat it; but you wanna be bad.
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it;
 No one wants to be de-feated.
 Showin' how funky and strong, is your fight,
 It doesn't matter, who's wrong or right;
Just beat it, beat it, just beat, beat it.
Just beat it, beat it, just beat, beat it.
 They're out to get you; better leave while you can;
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man.
You wanna stay alive; better do what you can,
So beat it, just beat it.
 You have to show them that you're really not scared;
You're playin' with your life; this ain't no truth or dare.
They'll kick you, then they beat you, then they'll tell you its fair;
So beat it; but you wanna be bad.
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it;
 No one wants to be de-feated.
 Showin' how funky and strong, is your fight,
 It doesn't matter, who's wrong or right.
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it;
 No one wants to be de-feated.
 Showin' how funky and strong, is your fight,
 It doesn't matter, who's wrong or right.
Just beat it, beat it, beat it.
 Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it;

 Showin' how funky and strong, is your fight,
 It doesn't matter, who's wrong or right.
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it;

 Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it;
 No one wants to be de-feated.

 It doesn't matter, who's wrong or right.
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it;

 It doesn't matter, who's wrong or right.
 She was more like a beauty queen, from a movie scene,
 I said; don't mind, but what do you mean; I am the one?
Who will dance on the floor, in the round.
She said; I am the one, who will dance on the floor, in the round.
 She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene.
 Then every head turned, with eyes that dreamed of being the one,
Who will dance on the floor, in the round.
 People always told me; be careful what you do;
And don't go around breaking young girl's hearts.
And mother always told me; be careful of who you love;
And be careful of what you do, 'cos the lie becomes the truth.
 Billie Jean is not my lover;
 She's just a girl who, claims that I am the one.
But the kid is not my son.
She says; I am the one, but the kid is not my son.
 For forty days and forty nights, the law was on her side.
 But who can stand, when she's in demand, her schemes and plans?
'Cos we danced on the floor, in the round.
So take my strong a-dvice; just remember to always think twice.
(Do think twice, do think twice).
 She told my baby we'd danced 'till three, then she looked a me,
 Then showed a photo; my baby cried; his eyes looked like mine.
Go on dance on the floor, in the round, baby.
 People always told me; be careful what you do;
And don't go around breaking young girl's hearts.
She came and stood right by me; then the smell of sweet perfume.
This happened much too soon; she called me to her room.
 Billie Jean is not my lover;
 She's just a girl who, claims that I am the one.
But the kid is not my son.
 Billie Jean is not my lover;
 She's just a girl who, claims that I am the one.

She says; I am the one,
She says he is my son.
She says; I am the one.
 Billie Jean is not my lover,
 Billie Jean is not my lover.
 Billie Jean is not my lover,
 Billie Jean is not my lover.
 Looking out, across the night-time;
 The city winks a sleepless eye.
 Hear her voice, shake my window;
 Sweet se-ducing sighs.
 Get me out, into the night-time;
 Four walls won't hold me, to-night.
 If this town, is just an apple;
 Then let me take a bite. (If they say);
 Why? why? Tell them that its human nature.
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? (If they say);
 Why? why? Tell them that its human nature.
 Why? why? Does he do me that way?
 Reaching out, to touch a stranger;
 Electric eyes are every-where.
 See that girl; she knows I'm watching,
 She likes the way I stare. (If they say):
 Why? why? Tell them that its human nature.
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? (If they say);
 Why? why? Tell them that its human nature.
 Why? why? Does he do me that way?
I like livin' this way,
I like lovin' this way.           That way.
 Looking out, a-cross the morning,
 The city's heart begin to beat.
 Reaching out, I touch her shoulder;
 I'm dreaming of the street. (If they say):
 Why? why? Tell them that its human nature.
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? (If they say);
 Why? why?
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? (If they say);
 Why? why? Ta da da da, cha cha cha cha.
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? (If they say);
 Why? why? 
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? (If they say);
 Why? why?
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? (If they say);
 Why? why? Ta da da da, ta da ta da.
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? I like livin' this way.
 Where did you come from, lady, and ooh, won't you take me there?
 Right away, won't you, baby?
 Tendoroni, you've got to be; spark my nature; sugar, fly with me.
Don't you know; now is the perfect time?
 We can make it right; hit the city lights.
Then to-night, ease the lovin' pain;
 Let me take you to the max.
I want to love you, (P.Y.T.), Pretty Young Thing,
 You need some lovin', (T.L.C.), Tender lovin' care.
 And I'll... take you there.
I want to love you, (P.Y.T.), Pretty Young Thing,

 And I'll... take you there.
 Anywhere you wanna go.
 Nothin' can stop this burnin',
De-sire to be with you; gotta get to you baby.
 Won't you come? It's emergency;
Cool my fire yearnin', honey; come set me free.
Don't you know; now is the perfect time?
 We can dim the lights, just to make it right.
In the night; hit the lovin' spot;
 I'll give you all I've got.
I want to love you, (P.Y.T.), Pretty Young Thing,
 You need some lovin', (T.L.C.), Tender lovin' care.
 And I'll... take you there.

 Pretty young things, repeat after me,
 I'll take you there, take you there.
I want to love you, (P.Y.T.), Pretty Young Thing,
 You need some lovin', (T.L.C.), Tender lovin' care.
 And I'll... take you there, take you there.
I want to love you, (P.Y.T.), Pretty Young Thing,
 You need some lovin', (T.L.C.), Tender lovin' care.
 And I'll... take you there, take you there.
 There'll be no darkness to-night;
 Lady our love, will shine,
 (Lighting the light).
 Just put your trust in my heart,
And meet me in para-dise.
 (Now is the time). Girl...
 You're every wonder in this world to me;
 A treasure time won't steal a-way.
 So listen to my heart; lay your body close to mine,
Let me fill you with my dreams; I can make you feel all right.
 And baby, through the years; gonna love you, more each day,
So I promise you, to-night; that you'll always be the lady in my life.
 Lay back in my tenderness;
 Let's make this a night, we won't for-get.
Girl, I need your sweet caress.
 Reach out to a fantasy;
 Two hearts, in the beat of ecsta-sy; come to me, girl...
 And I will keep you warm, through the shadows of the night,
Let me touch you with my love; I can make you feel so right.
 And baby, through the years; even when we're old and grey;
I will love you, more each day, 'cos you will always be the lady in my life.

You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination
Girl but all the while You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

There aint no second chance against the thing with the fourty eyes, girl

Night creatures call and the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time (They're open wide)
This is the end of your life, ooh
They're out to get you There's demons closing in on every side, ooh
They will possess you unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together, yeah

0,What Is It About Men (ver 2),Amy Winehouse,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/amy-winehouse/what-is-it-about-men-chords-681118,"Understand once he was a family man 
so surely I would never, ever go through it first hand 
Emulate all the shit my mother hated 
I can't help but demostrate my Freudian fate 
My alibi for taking your guy 
history repeats itself, it fails to die 
and animal agression is my downfall
I don't care 'bout what you got I want it all
It's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
and I question myself again: what is it 'bout men? 
My destructive side has grown a mile wide 
and I question myself again: what is it 'bout men? 
I'm nurturing, I just wanna do my thing 
and I'll take the wrong man as naturally as I sing 
and I'll save my tears for uncovering my fears 
for behavioural patters that stick over the years 
It's bricked up in my head, it's shoved under my bed
and I question myself again: what is it 'bout men? 
My destructive side has grown a mile wide 
and I question myself again: what is it 'bout men?

Little darlin' don't you see the sun is shining
Just for you, only today
If you hurry you can get a ray on you
Come with me, just to play
Like every humming bird and bumblebee, every sunflower, cloud and every tree
I feel so much a part of this
Nature's got me high and it's beautiful
I'm with this deep eternal universe from death until rebirth
This corner of the earth is like me in many ways
I can sit for hours here and watch the emerald feathers play
On the face of this I'm blessed when the sunlight comes for free
I know this corner of the earth it smiles at me
So inspired that there's nothing left to do or say
Think I'll dream till the stars shine
The wind it whispers and the clouds don't seem to care
And I know inside that it's all mine
It's the chorus of the breakin' dawn,
the mist that comes before the sun is born
To a hazy afternoon in May
Nature's got me high and it's so beautiful
I'm with this deep eternal universe from death until rebirth
This corner of the earth is like me in many ways
I can sit for hours here and watch the emerald feathers play
On the face of this I'm blessed when the sunlight comes for free
I know this corner of the earth it smiles at me

 I was flyin', now I'm crashin',  this is bad, real bad, Michael Jackson
 Now I'm mad, real mad, Joe Jackson, you should leave your boyfriend now, 
So you gotta take the good, the bad, happy and the sad
Or will you bring the better future then I had in the past
'Cause I don't want to make the same mistakes I did
 I don't wanna fall back on my face again
Woah, woah, I'll admit it, I was scared to answer loves call
Woah, woah, and if it hits, better make it worth the fall (when it comes around)

Nose to nose
Palm to palm 
We were always just that close 
Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So how come when I reach out my finger 
It feels like more than distance between us 
In this California king bed 
We're 10,000 miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars 
For your heart for me 
My California king
Eye to eye 
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn 
And a little last night on these sheets
So how come when I reach out my finger 
It feels like more than distance between us 
In this California king bed 
We're 10,000 miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars 
For your heart for me 
My California king
Just when I felt like giving up on us 
You turned around and gave me one last touch 
That made everything feel better 
And even then my eyes got wetter 
So confused wanna ask you if you love me 
Maybe ive been California dreaming
In this California king bed 
We're 10,000 miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars 
For your heart for me

Passe et nous laisse vide et incertain

  Et quand les temps sont durs
On se dit pire que « notre histoire n'existe pas »
Et quand l'hiver perdure
On se dit simplement que la chaleur nous reviendra
Et c'est facile comme ça
Jour après jour
On voit combien tout est éphémère
Alors même en amour
J'aimerai chaque reine
Comme si c'était la dernière

Tell me fellas have you seen her? (Seen her)
It was about five minutes ago
When I seen the hottest chick
That a young'n
   I said Yo,
Tell her girls I want to meet her (meet her)
On second thought that ain't the way to go
I got give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it
There she is I got to stop her
    Or should I talk about her smile? (It's been said before)
    Or what about her style? (Too obvious)
    I'm out of time
She's out the door
I got to go for mine
I think I'll say...
Yo
I dont know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me want to say yo
I know you're trying to leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
How I love to keep you here with me oh baby 
Now shorty grab hold of my hand
    And let's pretend the floor is ours
    You say you don't really dance
Don't worry about it
We'll just 1,2 step
1,2 step
Now if the music is moving too fast (too fast)
Grab my hand a little tighter (tighter)
Don't be afraid to move a little closer
   Girl, there is something about you 
that makes me want to say
Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me want to say yo
I know you're trying to leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
How I love to keep you here with me oh baby

Just let her know she was made for you.
And you want to do everything she want to man.

Pulls me down turns me weak for you 
I find myself repeating like a broken tune 
And I’m forever excusing your intentions
And I give in to my pretendings 
Which forgive you each time 
Without me knowing 
They melt my heart to stone 
And I hear your words that I made up 
You say my name like there could be an us 
I best tidy up my head I’m the only one in love 
I’m the only one in love 
Each and every time I turn around to leave 
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed 
So desperately I try to link it with my head 
But instead I fall back to my knees 
As you tear your way right through me 
I forgive you once again 
Without me knowing 
You’ve burnt my heart to stone 
And I hear your words that I made up 
You say my name like there could be an us 
I best tidy up my head I’m the only one in love 
I’m the only one in love 
Why do you steal my hand 
Whenever I’m standing my own ground 
You build me up, then leave me dead 
Well I hear your words you made up 
I say your name like there should be an us 
I best tidy up my head I’m the only one in love 
I’m the only one in love.

That love had come to you  
I thought you were not my kind  
I thought that I could never feel for you  
The passion and love you were feeling  
And so you left  
For someone new

Is like a train to catch before it's gone  
And maybe it's just an illusion

But I keep on hoping and praying
There will be a day when we meet again
And I'll keep on waiting and dreaming

    I could hold you for a million years

   But I would never do you wrong
   I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

    I'd go crawling down the avenue
    No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do

   And on the highway of regret
   Though winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet
I could make you happy make your dreams come true

‘Cause your trouble's like a flood raging through your veins
No amount of love's enough to end the pain
Tenderness and time can heal a right gone wrong
But the anger that you feel goes on and on
And it's not enough to know that I love you still
So I'll take my heart and go for I've had my fill
If you listen you can hear the angel's wings
Up above our heads so near they are hovering
Waiting to reach out for love when it falls apart
When it cannot rise above a wounded heart
When it cannot rise above a wounded heart

Pick you up after school.

But it hurts when I think, when I let it sink in
It’s all over me
I know you’re here, in the dark
I’m watchin' you sleep, it hurts a lot
And all I know is you’ve got to give me everything
And nothing less, 'cause you know I’d give you all of me
I’d give you everything that I am
I’m handin over everything that I’ve got
Cause I wanna have a really true love
Don’t ever wanna have to go and give you up
Stay up till four in the morning and the tears are pouring
And I wanna make it worth the fight
But what have we been doing for all this time
Baby if we’re gonna do it come and do it right
  All I wanted was to know I'm safe
  Don’t wanna lose the love I found
  Remember when you said that you would change
  Don’t let me down
It’s not fair, how you are
I can’t be complete, can you give me more
Oh please, you know what I need
Save all your lovin for me
We can’t escape the love

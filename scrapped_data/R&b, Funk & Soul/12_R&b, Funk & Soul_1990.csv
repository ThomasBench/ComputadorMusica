Don't break down and cry
I can be your sweetie

And I won't be forsaken
If you think thoughts unkind
Just bring home the bacon
And bring it home on time
Hey Louie, can't you see
I couldn't leave you if I tried
Hey Louie, listen to me
We got a thing so dignified
It don't matter if we lived in a shack
Or in a shiny cadillac
It don't matter rich or poor
When love is knocking at your door
It feels like Christmas
Just like Christmas
It feels like Christmas with you...
It feels like Christmas
Just like Christmas
It feels like Christmas with you...
Hey Louie, life is sweet
I can't be bitter
When you're here with me
Hey Louie, no regrets
Holding on to things
That you ought to forget
Well, it doesn't matter tit for tat
'Cause what you give
You get it back
It don't matter anymore
When love is knocking at your door
It feels like Christmas
Just like Christmas
It feels like Christmas with you,
Everytime I see ya
Everytime I hear ya
Everytime I'm near ya,
I'd be happy

You were the first who ever brought me out
Showed me what life and love was all about
Gave me things that I never need

I found joy in your touch
I miss your kisses, the way you made me blush

The way that you loved me
Not over you yet, not trying to forget
The way that you loved me
I hate you so for what you done to me
Made me fall in love with no security
I gotta move on, move on my life
But it's so hard when you're still on my mind

We drifted apart
And here you are by my side
So now I come to you, with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me
Open arms
Living without you, living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you, wanting you near
How much I wanted you home
But now that you've come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay.
So now I come to you, with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping youll see what your love means to me

42,Virtual Insanity (ver 5),Jamiroquai,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jamiroquai/virtual-insanity-chords-4178227,"    Oh yeah, aw
World we're livin' in
Let me tell ya
And it's a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell what magic spells we'll be doin' for us?
And I'm givin' all my love to this world
Only to be told
I can't see, I can't breathe
No more will we be
And nothin's going to change the way we live
'Cause we can always take, but never give
And now that things are changing for the worse, see
Woah, it's a crazy world we're livin' in
And I just can't see that half of us immersed in sin
Is all we have to give these
Futures made of virtual insanity, now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have for
Useless twisting, all the new technology
Oh, now there is no sound
For we all live underground
And I'm thinkin', what a mess we're in
Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip the sickly ties of Earth that man has made
And now every mother can choose the colour
Of her child
That's not nature's way
Well, that's what they said yesterday
There's nothin' left to do but pray
I think it's time I found a new religion
Whoa, it's so insane to synthesize another strain
There's something in these futures that we have to be told
Futures made of virtual insanity, now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have for
Useless twisting, all the new technology
Oh, now there is no sound
For we all live underground, whoa!
Now there is no sound
If we all live underground
And now it's virtual insanity
Forget your virtual reality
Oh, there's nothin' so bad
As a meddlin' man
Oh yeah, I know, yeah
    Oooooooohhh
Futures made of virtual insanity, now
Always seem to be governed by this love we have for
Useless twisting, all the new technology
Oh, now there is no sound
For we all live underground
Oh, now there's nothing that we live in
It's all goin' wrong
Out of window, you know
There is nothing worse than a rambling man
There is nothing worse than a foolish mind
       Virtual insanity is what we're livin' in
Yeah, yeah, it's alright

     I’m all alone
     Too much to see
     The world keeps turning
     Oh what a day
     What a day, what a day
Peace and blessings manifest with every lesson learned
If your knowledge were your wealth then it would be well earned
If we were made in his image then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in God but they fear us just the same
Oh on and on,and on and on
My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
On and on, and on and on
All night til the break of dawn
I go on and on, and on and on
My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone
On and on, and on and on
Goddamnit imma sing my song
I     was born underwater
    With three dollars and six    dimes, yeah you may laugh
      Like one two three
    Damn, y’all feel that?
      Like one two three
      The world keeps turning
    Oh what a day
    What a day, what a day
The man that knows something knows that he knows nothing at all
Does it seem colder in your summertime  and   hotter in your fall?
If we were made in his image then      call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in God but they  fear us just the same

Don’t feed me yours cause your food does not endure
 I think I need a cup of tea
 The world keeps burning
Oh what a day
     What a day, what a day
You rush into destruction cause you   don’t have nothing left
The mothership can’t save you so your  ass is gon get left
If we were made in his image then call  us by our names
Most in-tel-lects do not believe in God but  they  fear us just the same
Oh on and on,and on and on

Come and shine with your light on me
Come and play
With the chimes in the belfry
Come with me
And hold me in your arms
Let me feel your tenderness and your warmth
When the rain is falling hard
And the storm is far from over
My lady love, that's you
You give me warmth in the night
You take away my sadness, oh
My lady darling it's true
I give my world to you
Let me show you how
Let me show you now
I long to hear your voice
'Neath the night forlorn
And to gaze for awhile
Into your eyes reborn
And though my mind sometimes
Gets weak and cold
You'll remain like a song
In my heart and soul
When the rain is falling hard, oh
And the storm is far from over
My lady love, that's you
You give me warmth in the night
You take away my sadness, oh
   Well lady darling it's true
I give my world to you
Let me show you how
Let me show you now
Na na na na now
Na, now, now, now

Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing

Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old
  It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
  Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
  By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
  Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure
Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was eleven years old
  I always had that dream like my daddy before me
  So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
  Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
  Cause only those I really love will ever really know me
Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was 20 years old
  I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
  Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
  I got my boys with me at least those in favour
  And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing about everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old
Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be 30 years old
  I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
And I can tell them stories
  Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
  And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry
Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
   I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
   I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old

For all the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I’m crying, oh my oh, well I ain’t
And I didn’t wanna write a song
Cause I didn’t want anyone thinking I still care
I don’t but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I’ll be movin’ on and I think you should be somethin’
I don’t wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
My mama don’t like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I’ve been so caught up in my job, didn’t see what’s going on
And now I know, I’m better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I’m still holdin’ on to something
You should go and love yourself
When you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didn’t wanna write a song
Cause I didn’t want anyone thinking I still care
I don’t but, you still hit my phone up

For all the times you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I fear nothin’ at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

Oh baby you should go and love yourself

You like me best when I'm off my rocker
Tell you a secret, I'm not alarmed
So what if I'm crazy? The best people are
 You think I'm crazy, you think I'm gone
So what if I'm crazy? All the best people are
 And I think you're crazy too, I know you're gone
That's probably the reason that we get along
I'm nuts, baby, I'm mad,
The craziest friend that you've ever had
You think I'm psycho, you think I'm gone
Tell the psychiatrist something is wrong
Over the bend, entirely bonkers
You like me best when I'm off my rocker
Tell you a secret, I'm not alarmed
So what if I'm crazy? The best people are
All the best people are crazy,  
All the best people are
All the best people are crazy, 
All the best people are

Wonder why it don't move
Tryna get a hand
Watching people break the rules
And maybe the man in charge, doesn't like my face
But then this world's not always good
And nothing's real but love
Nothing's real but love
No money, no house, no car, is like love...
They watch us open-mouthed
As we joke around like fools
See who can be the worst
Watch what I can do
But then the door gets slammed, slammed right in my face
And I guess this world's not always good
And nothing's real but love
Nothing's real but love
No house, no car, no job, can beat love...
It won't fill you up
No money, no house, no car, is like love...
La la la la  la la la la
I put it all away
Holding it down for a rainy day
But what if that day don't come
I need love
No money, no house, no car, is like love...
It don't fill you up
It won't build you up
It won't fill you up
It's not love!
And nothing's real but love
No money, no house, no car, is like love...

No money, no house, no car, is like love....

  'Cause from over here I've missed the joke
   Cleared the way for my crash landing
  I've done it again, another number for your notes 
   I'd be smiling if I wasn't so desperate
   I'd be patient if I had the time
   I could stop and answer all of your questions
As soon as I find out how I could move from the back of the line
So I'll be your clown
Behind the glass
Go 'head and laugh 'cause it's funny 
I would too if I saw me
I'll be your clown
On your favorite channel
My life's a circus-circus rounding circles
I'm selling out tonight
I'd be less angry if it was my decision
And the money was just rolling in
If I had more than my ambition
I'll have time to please I'll have time to thank you as soon as I win
So I'll be your clown
Behind the glass
Go 'head and laugh 'cause it's funny 
I would too if I saw me
I'll be your clown
On your favorite channel
My life's a circus-circus rounding circles
I'm selling out tonight 
 From a distance my choice is simple
 From a distance I can entertain
 So you can see me I put makeup on my face
But there's no way you can feel it
From so far away
So I'll be your clown

Go 'head and laugh 'cause it's funny 
I would too if I saw me
I'll be your clown

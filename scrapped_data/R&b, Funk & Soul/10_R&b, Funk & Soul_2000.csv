Up in the sky
Poppin' champagne
Livin' the life
In the fast lane
And I wont change
By the Glamorous, oh the flossy flossy
The glamorous,
The glamorous, glamorous (the glamorous life)
By the Glamorous, oh the flossy flossy
Wear them gold and diamonds rings
All them things don't mean a thing
Chaperons and limousines
Shopping for expensive things
I be on the movie screens
Magazines and boogie scenes
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine
I'm no queen, I'm no machine
I still go to Taco Bell
Drive through, raw as hell
I don't care, I'm still real
No matter how many records I sell
After the show or after the Grammies
I like to go cool out with the family
Sippin', reminiscing on days when I had a Mustang

Ooooooooh
Sometimes i sit and i wonder
And i just can't seem to believe
What a blessing it's been to be loved
You're an angel sent to me
You're the star who lights up my sky
You're the one who made me see
That you don't need wings to fly
Your love has set me free
Cause you are the one who makes me whole
In my heart and in my soul
And just like the sun you showed me the light
I'm amazed and you're the reason why
Before you i was so blind
I didn't know which path to choose
You poured all of this love in my heart
And there's no way that I can lose
And when i have no faith in myself
You're the one who makes me strong
I wouldn't have a story to tell
Or an ending to my song

So deep that I, I can't get out
And when you're lost, lost and alone
Yes you'd think it was the last place   
You'd come back for more
If you don't want me to leave
Then don't push me away
Rather blow out the lights
But I'm going nowhere
I'm gonna stay

When you're closing your eyes
'Cause you don't wanna love me
I'm gonna stay

Where I don't wanna love you
And when there's no, no stone
Then how can I feel the corn

Then what is this feeling
That keeps on bringing me back to you

And you're closing your eyes
'Cause you don't wanna love me
So I'm gonna stay, yes I will
You can't push me too far

Where I don't wanna love you
And if you ask me to leave
And I walked away 
We'd still be alone

When you just wanna fight
And there’s tears in your eyes

You’re beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you girl it’s incredible

The world could not go on so every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn’t wanna go if I can’t see your face, can’t hold you close
What good would Heaven be
If the angels came for me I’d tell them no
I don’t wanna leave my baby alone
I don’t want nobody else to hold you
That’s a chance I’ll take
Baby I’ll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her

Heaven can wait
Unthinkable
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you’d be moving on (moving on)
I’d turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Can’t stand to see nobody kissing, touching her
Couldn’t take nobody loving you the way we were
What good would Heaven be
If the angels come for me I’d tell them no- oh- oh

Once I had everything now it's gone
Don't tell me again coz I've heard it all before
Some people say that i'm not worth it
I've made mistakes but nobody's perfect
Guess I'll give it a try
I've got one last chance to get myself together
I can't lose no more time it's now or never
and I'll try to remember who i used to be
I've got one last chance to get myself together
The time has come for me to change again
I can't carry on like this, I will lose my friends
Don't say that you have given up on me
Just give me the time and space to heal my head

I've made mistakes but nobody's perfect

I can't lose no more time it's now or never

And so tie me to the mast I must believe!

And the dark goumas they flicked dynamite

As if to pray to the gods of the festival
And there we were in the depths of the wild below

That I got a whole lot of pain in me
And it will always remain in me
So cold it’s a crying shame
Yet here I am trying again
Cause I refuse to die in vain
The circumstances put soul in me
And there ain’t no holding me

I’ll deal with it then

I can laugh at it now

It's gotta be ya fiesty style, raised eyebrow
I love it when you look at me that way
Now we're in, you order a Mojito at the bar
You re-apply your lippy cos it came off on the glass
The DJ plays your favourite song, Kanye's on
Now ya beckoning for me to dance
Mmmm, pullin me, pullin me, pullin me close
Just close your eyes girl
Whispering, tellin' me we gotta go
Won't you take me home I want to ride it
Ride it, we're all alone
Ride it, just lose control
Ride it, ride it, come touch my soul
Ride it, ride, let me feel you
Ride it, turn the lights down low
Ride it, from head to toe
Ride it, ride it, touch my soul
Ride it, ride, let me feel you
Everything was right
Until her phone began to ring
She takes it to the corner
That's when I start wondering
I can hear her shouting,
Banging fists against the door
Yelling yo it's over I can't take it any more
Then I walk away
And act all nonchalant and chill
I ain't tryna get all
Caught up in her mess for real
But she came on out
And backed me up against the wall
She said I know you heard
But I'll make you forget it all
Baby let me feel you
Ride it, we're all alone
Ride it, just lose control
Ride it, ride it, come touch my soul
Ride it, ride, let me feel you
Ride it, turn the lights down low
Ride it, from head to toe
Ride it, ride it, touch my soul
Ride it, ride, let me feel you

I wanna hear my sound
Don't care about all the pain in front of me
I just wanna be happy
Happy,  happy
I just wanna be hap-py      happy

Oh oh oh yeah, Ooh oh ooh oh oh
Came in the door, Checked in my coat
And who I'm looking for, Is staring in my face
They played our song, We hit the floor
He held me strong, And we danced the night away
I can see the way that he's making me
Feel this way about his love
I’ve been looking for something like this
I’m saying ooh oh oh oh ooh oh oh !
If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say  oh oh oh, say  oh oh oh !
If you go left right up down
Gotya you spinnin' round and round
Say  ooh oh oh oh, say  ooh oh oh oh !
It's been a long long time, Since I fell, fell
Love has found my way oh oh oh
I've been looking (looking), I've been searching (searching)
For the man to touch this place, oh ooh oh yeah
Can't deny the way that he is making me feel
This way about his love
I've been searching for something like this
I'm saying oooh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh !
If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say  oh oh oh, say  oh oh oh !
If you go left right up down
Gotya you spinnin' round and round
Say  ooh oh oh oh, say  ooh oh oh oh !
If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say  oh oh oh, say  oh oh oh !
If you go left right up down
Gotya you spinnin' round and round
Say  ooh oh oh oh, say  ooh oh oh oh !
If you feel good, If you’re feeling good
Put one hand in the air, say yeah
If you feel good, If you’re feeling good
It's cause love is in the air, Love is in the air
If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say  oh oh oh, say  oh oh oh !
If you go left right up down
Gotya you spinnin' round and round
Say  ooh oh oh oh, say  ooh oh oh oh !
If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say  oh oh oh, say  oh oh oh !
If you go left right up down
Gotya you spinnin' round and round
Say  ooh oh oh oh, say  ooh oh oh oh !

 That you walked into my    life
 It was just the kind of thing
 That was so right  on       time
 After all the love  changes
 My heart had locked the door
 Then that girl released her magic
 And made me love once more, ooh
Like the warm rays of the sun
 Her sweet love came shining down on me, oh
 All at once turned my life around
And with one kiss, she set me free
[1] She's given me joy,   joy,     joy
 That girl, she brings me joy
 She's given me joy,   joy,    joy
 That girl, she brings me joy

 I am the moonlight, you are the spring.
 Our life's a sacred thing.
 You know I always will love you.
 I am forever, I am the one who came when you felt down
 I was the only one around, when things were hurting you.
 I am forever, wasnt it I who said that you are free.
 Wonder if it seems so hard to be and things would hurt you.
 I am forever, I am forever 
 We are forever, we are forever
 I am your friend, through thick and thin.
 We need each other, we'll never part,
 our love is from the heart.
 We never say I dont need you.
 We are forever, was the one who said that you are free.
 Wonder if it seems so hard to be and things would hurt you.
 I am forever, wasn't it I who carried you around?
 When all the walls came tumbling down and things would hurt you.
 I am forever, I am forever 
 We are forever, we are forever
 You are the sun that lights up the sky,
 when things are shaded, let go and then we do get by.
 I was the only one around when things would hurt you.

Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many struggles must there be

Every path you take you're leaving your legacy

Don't let no one get you down
Keep moving on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self-motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history
How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land
And how many children have to die

And spirits dancing

That's why he had 2 wait
If he poured his heart into a glass and offered it like wine
She could drink and be back in time 4 the morning papers
They could take a walk down the ocean side
Make a wish on every wave
They could find a carousel and ride
Or kiss in every cave
They could contemplate the entire universe or just one star
Oh, just how far was the walk 4 the morning papers?
Why is age more than a number when it comes 2 love?
Should we ask the ones who speculate
When they don't know what it's made of?
Should we ask the moonlight on your face
or the raindrops in your hair?
Or should we ask the man who wrote it there in the morning papers?

Och mitt hjärta slog, jag hörde varje slag
Jag ville komma nära dig och jag ska göra det en dag, för
Varje gång jag ser dig är det som om allting stannar till
Och jag vet inte varför
Men varje gång jag ser dig känner jag att det enda jag vill
Är att komma dig nära
Det är samma sak, varje gång vi ses
Jag såg dig igår kväll och vi växla' några ord
Några artiga fraser om vädret, sen gick du till ett bord
Du satt och prata' med nån annan, medan du vicka' på din stol
Och jag borde gått, jag borde gett mig av
Men nånting hos dig, höll mig kvar
Varje gång jag ser dig är det som om allting stannar till
Och jag vet inte varför
Men varje gång jag ser dig känner jag att det enda jag vill
Är att komma dig nära

Crying her eyes out
She had an obsession with me
I was the love of her life

 She was staring at me
I knew even then we would share something special
 And it was like chemistry
I fell in love from the moment I saw her
 So I took her straight home with me
And that's where I'd dream
She would step right out of the picture
And spend the whole evening with me
And oh how she hated to go
Back to her picture
The girl in the Life magazine
All of my friends used to laugh
Said I was certifiably mad
'Till the day she came
And she blew them away
And asked me if I'd be her man

In love with my letters
She says she's been looking for me

44,To Be Forgiven,George Michael,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/george-michael/to-be-forgiven-chords-2922713,"     I'm going down
Won't you help me (wont you help me now)
Save me (save me..save me..) from myself
     I hear the sound of a memory
Maybe ( maybe..maybe..) time will tell
Suddenly my life is like a river
Taking me places I don't want to go
But like all good men who swim too well
It takes all that I have just to cry for help
Then that voice in my head
Tells me no
     I'm going down
Won't you help me (wont you help me now)
Save me (save me..save me..) from myself
     I look around for a fantasy
Maybe ....... who can tell
Let me live my life beside the river (the revir)
Take me to places where a child    can grow
And then,  Maybe , maybe
the boy inside will forsake me
Maybe, The child in me
Will just    let me go..
      I'm going down
The cold, cold water is rushing in
      I'm going down
And I would beg to be forgiven
If I knew my sin
If I knew my sin
Save me (save me)
Save me (save me)
Save me (save me)
Save me (save me)
    I'm going down
    I'm going down
    I'm going down
    I'm going down

45,Petals,Mariah Carey,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/mariah-carey/petals-chords-1819758,"I've often wondered if there's
Ever been a perfect family
I've always longed for undividedness
And sought stability
A flower taught me how to pray
But as I grew, that flower changed
She started flailing in the wind
Like golden petals scattering
And I miss you dandelion
And even love you
And I wish there was a way
For me to trust you
But it hurts me every time
I try to touch you
But I miss you dandelion
And even love you
I gravitated towards a patriarch
So young predictably
I was resigned to spend my life
With a maze of misery
A boy and a girl befriended me
We bonded through despondency
I stayed so long but finally
I fled to save my sanity
And I miss you little sis and
Little brother
And I hope you realize
L'll always love you
And although you're struggling
You will recover
And I miss you little sis and
Little brother
So many I considered
Closest to me
Turned on a dime and sold me
Out dutifully
Although that knife was chipping
Away at me
They turned their eyes away and
Went home to sleep ...
And I missed a lot of life
But l'II recover
Though I know you really like
To see me suffer
Still I wish that you and I'd
Forgive each other
'Cause I miss you, Valentine
And really loved you
I really loved you -
I tried so hard
But you drove me away
To preserve my sanity -
And I found the strength to break away
Fly...
I know 
there is a rainbow
For me to follow 
To get beyond my sorrow
Thunder precedes the sunlight
so I'll be alright
If I can find that rainbow's end
I will be alright if I can find that rainbow's
End

Turned out to be a lie
How will you know the Truth?
If you were given   all the answers
And you stopped to wonder why
But how will you know the Truth?
Everybody's got a right to love
Everybody's got a right to lie
But the choice you make it ain't no piece of cake
It ain't no motherfuckin' piece of pie
What If time's only reason?
Was to give us all something to fear?
And if so you all, the end of the journey's so clear
Questionaire, What did you stand for?
Questionaire, Who did you save?
When it gets right down to wait a minute
When it gets right down to the nitty of the gritty
When it gets right down to it you take more than you gave
Everybody's got a right to love
Everybody's got a right to lie
But the choice you make it ain't no piece of cake
It ain't no motherfuckin' piece of pie
Got to (Going to?) tell the truth you all
Got to tell the truth
Got to tell the truth you all
Got to tell the truth
Got to tell the truth you all
If there was just one day
That everybody tell the truth
We'd all trade bank accounts and move to back to Neptune

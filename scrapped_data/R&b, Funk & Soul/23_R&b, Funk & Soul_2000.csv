0,Best I Ever Had (ver 5),Drake,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/drake/best-i-ever-had-chords-3205616,"You know, a lot of girls be
Thinkin' my songs are about them
This is not to get confused
This one's for you
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Know you got a roommate, call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (Yup)
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
You don't even trip when friends say
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)

I don't know  where to go, couldn't see   where it leads.
   Making castles in the sand,  afraid no one else would hold my hand.
I'm stained from the world,  sad, sad,   sad little girl..
But I see in your eyes, you wear no disguise..
Help me find my way.
I'm like a bird in the sky, you help me to  fly!
Fly away, fly away..
Back home.. Back  home.
Holding on to memories, often scared, of what I'd see.
And then you came, and then you came,

Help me find my way.

Of when we used to fuss and fight but end up kissing
There may be sad and pain for time so long to wait

I can brush my troubles away,

I got sun shining in my life. 
I used to think I could get better,
my girlfriends always used to get me wrong. 
Some just sent messages, love letters,

Cause now the only love I find's within a castle made of sand, 
and when the tide goes out it's swept away.

  When you're not there by my side
  Sick of nightmares in my sleep
  When there's no place I can hide
  See the beauty in the flood
  That drips down from my eyes
  Hold the parts that were ripped out
  That had took me by surprise
I'm a broken doll
And you're the puppeteer
Take control for me
And wipe away my fear
Piece me all together
Though broken I am sweet
You thought my heart was made of wood
But I can hear it beat
Boom, boom, there it goes, boom, boom
I'm dancing in your light
And I like it here
I'm a broken doll
And you're the puppeteer
Take control for me
And wipe away my fear
I'm a broken doll
And you're the puppeteer
Take control for me
And wipe away my fear
Piece me all together
Though broken I am sweet
You thought my heart was made of wood
But I can hear it beat
    I'm a broken doll
    You're the puppeteer
    Take control for me
    And wipe away my fear
    Piece me all together
    Though broken I am sweet
    You thought my heart was made of wood
 The Prophet took my hand on All Souls' Day
 He preached the value of deception
 Changing shadows by a shapeshifter's rules
 Tales are never just for fools
 The court of conscience came before me
 Presenting me with a heavenly angel
 You took my hand and asked me, truths aside
 To his questions I replied
 Do you want the truth or something beautiful?
 Just close your eyes and make believe
 Do you want the truth or something beautiful?
 I am happy to deceive you
 He stood as tall as redwood trees
 Drank tea from a seamstress' thimble
 I didn't want to speak the honest truth
 So I spit out lies that aimed to soothe
 Do you want the truth or something beautiful?
 Just close your eyes and make believe
 Do you want the truth or something beautiful?
 I am happy to deceive you
Sacred lies and telling tales
I can be who you want me to be
Sacred lies and telling tales
I can be who you want me to be
But do you want me?
 Do you want the truth or something beautiful?
 Just close your eyes and make believe
 Do you want the truth or something beautiful?
 I am happy to deceive you
Sacred lies and telling tales
I can be who you want me to be
Sacred lies and telling tales
I can be who you want me to be
But do you want me?
Angels watching over me with smiles upon their face
Cause I have made it through this far in an unforgiving place
It feels sometimes this hill's too steep for a girl like me to climb
But I must knock those thoughts right down I do it in my own time
I don't care (care care)

On a road that leads me to straight to who knows where

Watchin people scurry by rushing to and fro
Oh this world is such a crazy place it's all about the go go go
Sometimes life can taste so sweet when you slow it down
You start to see the world a little differently when you turn it upside down
I don't care (care care)
I'm half way there (nowhere)
And I'm just soaking up the magic in the air
I tell you what (I tell you what)

 The plastic flowers you gave
 Sit on the table, so unstable
 And there are some greasy fingerprints
On that pre-wrote birthday card you wrote your name in
And I know that you make your effort 
But I think you could do much better
Are roses blue and violets red?
Say it isn't true
Don't tell me romance is dead
So wake up you sleepy head
All your dreams are just a kiss away
 I asked you for a letter
So you e-mailed, have we failed?
Oh, you kiss with such a potential, 
 Then ask to speed up, it's not enough
Now I am carrying my own bags up 
17 flights of stairs, love
Are roses blue and violets red?
Say it isn't true
Don't tell me romance is dead
So wake up you sleepy head
Think of all the magic we could make
All your dreams are just a kiss away
 It shouldn't take just Valentine's Day 
Just to show you love me
 You don't need any money 
Just a bit of imagination
Are roses blue and violets red?
Say it isn't true
Don't tell me romance is dead
So wake up you sleepy head
Think of all the magic we could make
All your dreams are just a kiss away
Are roses blue and violets red?
Say it isn't true
Don't tell me romance is dead
So wake up you sleepy head
Think of all the magic we could make
   All your dreams...
Are roses blue and violets red?
Say it isn't true
Don't tell me romance is dead
So wake up you sleepy head
Think of all the magic we could make
All your dreams are just a kiss away
He left me for another lady
She stood so tall and she never slept
The was not one moment he could regret
He left me for another lady
 He took my hand one day and told me
He was leaving, me disbelieving
And I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Had to let him go
Her name was New York, New York
And she took his heart away oh my
Her name was New York, New York
She had poisoned his sweet mind
 Mmmm
The wolves they howled for my lost soul
 I fell down a deep black hole
He left me for another lady
She poured the drinks and she poured the power
Diamond girl who could talk for hours
He left me for another lady
 Now I am on my own
He told me he was leaving
And I was pleading
And I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Had to let him go
Her name was New York, New York
And she took his heart away oh my
Her name was New York, New York
She had poisoned his sweet mind
The greatest times, I don't wanna hear it
Your new laughter lines, I don't wanna hear it
The new found friends she introduced you to
I don't wanna know them I just wanna be with you
Please don't make me go to...
New Yooork, New York
She took your heart away oh my
Her name was New York, New York
She had poisoned your sweet mind
She poisoned your sweet mind

  He was a star collector, she knew about the skies.
  He was a tight-rope walker, she was the talk of the town.
  While he was in the clouds
  He'd show her the signs and he'd know what they mean
  Twinkle twinkle, little dream.
Stargazer, heartbreaker.
Wish you were here.
How will I shine anymore without your atmosphere?
My dear stargazer, don't disappear.
How will I shine anymore when you're not here?
Ba da da, ba da da, ba da.
  She had it all and lost it, now he's forever in space.
  He circles Haley's comet, lights up the sky like a flame.
  Now she's the star collector,
  She knows the signs and she knows what they mean
  Twinkle twinkle, little dream.
Stargazer, heartbreaker.
Wish you were here.
How will I shine anymore without your atmosphere?
My dear stargazer, don't disappear.
How will I shine anymore when you're not here?
You're my every day and the moment I wake up lonely;
You're the only one who can bring the stars for me...
Twinkle twinkle, little dream.
      My little dream
Stargazer, heartbreaker.
Wish you were here.
How will I shine anymore without your atmosphere?
My dear stargazer, don't disappear.
How will I shine anymore when you're not here?
(Ba da da, ba da da, ba da) Give me a shooting star.
And I'll make a wish, I'll make a wish for you.
(Ba da da, ba da da, ba da)
How will I shine anymore      when you're not here?
I'm collecting people's tears 
They cried because they miss you
They fill the seas and all the lakes
With memories the wind blew
I'd run out of jars before a second could pass
 Didn't have enough time with you to turn the hourglass
Pictures in my head suddenly appear
Why d'you have to go away
It's all not very clear
 Goodbye sweet angel
 Sail away on teary seas
 Tattooed the time we had
 On my memory
 My legs are weak
When I close my eyes I see you,
The dimples in your cheeks,
I forgot to thank you for the things
Cause I didn't see you for weeks
Woke up this morning and hoped for a dream
 But reality sat next to me and forced me to believe.
Knocked down too soon
Like a skittle on the lanes
The man who took the wrong stop
From life's fast moving train.
 Goodbye sweet angel
 Sail away on teary seas
 Tattooed the time we had
 On my memory
Ooooh oh Funeral Flowers
 Won't make me believe
 They can carry out the casket
 And I'll still expect to see you
 You come round tomorrow 
 I don't ask for much from you
 Only give me one more chance
 To say my last goodbye
 Goodbye sweet angel
 Sail away on teary seas
 Tattooed the time we had
 On my memory
 Goodbye sweet angel
 Sail away on teary seas
 Tattooed the time we had
 On my memory
(Goodbye sweet angel)
(Sail away on teary seas)
(Tattooed the times we had)
(On my memory)
 We are a lullaby, an everlasting song
 Taken as prisoners to a place where we belong
If the tune stops, I will not wake, oh no
Without us I'm no one, my soul swells and aches
 So on the day when the music dies, so will our love
There'll be some pain, but I'll keep it in my locket
If you'll lead the band, then I will have to follow
There's no escape for me, so
(Play on) Keep me dancing in the air
(Play on) No one else they can compare
(Play on) To the harmony of our sweet rapture
(Play on) You have a supernatural flair
(Play on) Push me further than I dare
(Play on) Play on, play on, play on
So play on for me
 So if this melody should stop or fade away
The oceans will drain out, and the stars disintegrate
It's like voodoo, I've lost all my control
I look into you, you make me rock and roll
 So on the day when the music dies, so will our love
There'll be some pain, but I'll keep it in my locket
If you'll lead the band, then I will have to follow
There's no escape for me, so
(Play on) Keep me dancing in the air
(Play on) No one else they can compare
(Play on) To the harmony of our sweet rapture
(Play on) You have a supernatural flair
(Play on) Push me further than I dare
(Play on) Play on, play on, play on
So play on for me
 (Play on and on and on and on...)
(Play on) Keep me dancing in the air
(Play on) No one else they can compare
(Play on) To the harmony of our sweet rapture
(Play on) You have a supernatural flair
(Play on) Push me further than I dare
(Play on) Play on, play on, play on
So play on for me
(Play on, play on) 
To the harmony of our sweet rapture
(Play on) You have a supernatural flair
(Play on) Push me further than I dare
So play on for me

25,Romance Is Dead,Paloma Faith,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/paloma-faith/romance-is-dead-chords-1837020," The plastic flowers you gave
 Sit on the table, so unstable
 And there are some greasy fingerprints
 On that pre-wrote birthday card you wrote your name in
 And I know that you make your effort 
 But I think you could do much better
Are roses blue and violets red?
Say it isn't true
Don't tell me romance is dead
So wake up you sleepy head
All your dreams are just a kiss away
 I asked you for a letter
 So you e-mailed, have we failed?
 Oh, you kiss with such a potential, 
 Then ask to speed up, it's not enough
 Now I am carrying my own bags up 
 17 flights of stairs, love
Are roses blue and violets red?
Say it isn't true
Don't tell me romance is dead
So wake up you sleepy head
Think of all the magic we could make
All your dreams are just a kiss away
 It shouldn't take just Valentine's Day 
 Just to show you love me
 You don't need any money 
 Just a bit of imagination
Are roses blue and violets red?
Say it isn't true
Don't tell me romance is dead
So wake up you sleepy head
Think of all the magic we could make
All your dreams are just a kiss away
Are roses blue and violets red?

Don't tell me romance is dead

They fill the seas and all the lakes
With memories the wind blew
I'd run out of jars before a second could pass
 Didn't have enough time with you to turn the hourglass
Pictures in my head suddenly appear
Why d'you have to go away
It's all not very clear
 Goodbye sweet angel
 Sail away on teary seas
 Tattooed the time we had
 On my memory
 My legs are weak
When I close my eyes I see you,
The dimples in your cheeks,
I forgot to thank you for the things
Cause I didn't see you for weeks
Woke up this morning and hoped for a dream
 But reality sat next to me and forced me to believe.
Knocked down too soon
Like a skittle on the lanes
The man who took the wrong stop
From life's fast moving train.
 Goodbye sweet angel
 Sail away on teary seas
 Tattooed the time we had
 On my memory
Ooooh oh Funeral Flowers
 Won't make me believe
 They can carry out the casket
 And I'll still expect to see you
 You come round tomorrow 
 I don't ask for much from you
 Only give me one more chance
 To say my last goodbye

Incurable,
On t'a vu errer dans les rues,
A des heures improbables,
Hurler à tes amours déçues,
Par un misérable,
Une pauvre fille anéantie,
Pour un pauvre diable.
Pleurer,
Tu ne fais que pleurer,
Tu vis dans tes pensées,
Et ça te fais pleurer.
Pleurer,
Tu ne fais que pleurer,
C'est fini de danser,
La fête est terminée.
Pitoyable,
Tu noies tes illusions perdues,
Dans des bistrots minables,
Tu pleures dans des bras inconnus,
Que tu crois charitables,
Une pauvre fille qui se maudit,
Pour un pauvre diable.
Pour un fils de salaud,
Qui tue avec des mots,
Un frimeur, un macho,
Que tu avais trouvé beau.
Un petit escroc,
A qui tu donnais trop,
Qui ne t'a pas fait de cadeau,
Quand il t'a tourné le dos.
Pitoyable,
On t'a vu errer dans les rues,
A des heures improbables,
Hurler à tes amours déçues,
Par un misérable,
Une pauvre fille qui se maudit,
Pour un pauvre diable.
Pitoyable,
Tu pleures dans des bras inconnus,
Que tu crois charitables,
Une pauvre fille qui se maudit,
Pour un pauvre diable.
Pitoyable,

  Would you believe me, would you agree?
  It's almost that feeling that we've met before so tell me that you don't
think I'm crazy when I tell you love has come here and now.
A moment like this.
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this.
Some people search forever for that one special kiss.
I can't believe it's happening to me.
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this.
  Everything changes, but beauty remains.
   Something so tender  I can't explain.
 Well, I may be dreaming but till I awake... Can we make the dream last forever?
And I'll cherish all the love that we share for a moment like this.

I would pray for hope and unity, on Christmas da-ay.
If I had one wish for Christma-as.
There would be joy and peace here on earth.
If I-I had one wish for Christmas this year.
We would all, come together as one..
If Rudolph and his reindeer, ran into dela-ays.
I'd still hope for jo-oy, this season, on yeah.
And if somehow Santa-a, got lost on his way.
I would try to find, a way to smile.
Smile on Christmas day, ohohohoh..
If I had one wish for Christma-as.
There would be joy and peace here on earth.
If I had one wish for Christmas this ye-ar.
We would all, come together as one, ohohè..

All those mate-ri-al, tha-a-angs. (no,no)
 What you've gotta think about:
Is the love Christmas bri-iings, yeah yeah,yeah.

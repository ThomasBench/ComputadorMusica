0,Simple And Clean,Utada Hikaru,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/utada-hikaru/simple-and-clean-chords-94502,"When you walk away
You don't hear me say please
Oh baby, don't go
Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight
It's hard to let it go
You're giving me too many things
Lately you're all I need
You smiled at me and said,
Don't get me wrong I love you
But does that mean I have to meet your father?
When we are older you'll understand
What I meant when I said ""No,
I don't think life is quite that simple""
When you walk away
You don't hear me say please
Oh baby, don't go
Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight
It's hard to let it go
The daily things that keep us all busy
Are confusing me
That's when you came to me and said,
Wish I could prove I love you
But does that mean I have to walk on water?
When we are older you'll understand
It's enough when I say so
And maybe some things are that simple
When you walk away
You don't hear me say please
Oh baby, don't go
Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight
It's hard to let it go
Hold me
Whatever lies beyond this morning
Is a little later on
Regardless of warnings the future doesn't scare me at all
Nothing's like before
When you walk away
You don't hear me say please
Oh baby, don't go
Simple and clean is the way that you're making me feel tonight
It's hard to let it go
Hold me
Whatever lies beyond this morning
Is a little later on
Regardless of warnings the future doesn't scare me at all
Nothing's like before
Hold me
Whatever lies beyond this morning
Is a little later on
Regardless of warnings the future doesn't scare me at all
Nothing's like before..

1,Make You Feel My Love (ver 14),Adele,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/adele/make-you-feel-my-love-chords-1120794,"  When the rain is blowing in your face,
  And the whole world is on your case,
  I could offer you a warm embrace
  To make you feel my love.
  When the evening shadows and the stars appear,
  And there is no one there to dry your tears,
  I could hold you for a million years
  To make you feel my love.
  I know you haven't made your mind up yet,
  And I could never do you wrong.
  I've known it from the moment that we met,
  No doubt in my mind where you belong.
  I'd go hungry; I'd go black and blue,
  And I'd go crawling down the avenue.
  No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
  To make you feel my love.
  The storms are raging on the rolling sea
  And on the highway of regret.
  The winds of change are blowing wild and free,
  You ain't seen nothing like me yet.
  I could make you happy, make your dreams come true.
  Nothing that I wouldn't do.
  Go to the ends of the Earth for you,
  To make you feel my love,
  To make you feel my love.

2,Footprints In The Sand (ver 2),Leona Lewis,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/leona-lewis/footprints-in-the-sand-chords-667982,"    You walked with me 
Footprints in the sand 
And helped me understand 
Where I'm going 
   You walked with me 
When I was all alone 
With so much unknown 
Along the way 
then I heard you say
I promise you 
   I'm always there 
When your heart is filled with sorrow 
And despair 
And I'll carry you 
   When you need a friend 
You'll find my footprints in the sand 
  I see my life
Flash across the sky
So many times have I
Been so afraid 
   And just when I
Have thought I've lost my way
You give me strength to carry on
That's when I heard you say
I promise you 
   I'm always there 
When your heart is filled with sorrow 
And despair 
And I'll carry you 
   When you need a friend 
You'll find my footprints in the sand
   When I'm weary 
   Well I know you'll be there 
and I can feel you 
When you say 
I promise you 
    I'm always there 
When your heart is filled with sadness and despair 
Oh, I'll carry you 
  When you need a friend 
You'll find my footprints in the sand 
When your heart is full of sadness and despair 
I'll carry you 
When you need a friend 
You'll find my footprints

3,Irreplaceable (ver 5),Beyoncé,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/971852,"To the left, To the left 
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet that's my stuff - Yes
If I bought it  please don't touch (don't touch)
And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time and
It's my mine name that is on that Jag
So remove your bags let me call you a cab
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I'm such a fool - Talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute - baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking you're irreplaceable
So go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet ya thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
Cause you was untrue 
Rolling her around in the car that I bought youOO
Baby drop them keys hurry up before your taxi leaves
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I'm such a fool - Talking about
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute - baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I will have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking..... 
You're irreplaceable (irreplacable)
So since I'm not your everything
How about I'll be nothing, nothing at all to you (nothing)
Baby I wont shed a tear for you (I wont shed a tear for you)
I won't lose a wink of sleep (a wink of sleep)
Cause the truth of the matter is... replacing you is so easy
To the left, To the left 
To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking...

You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute - baby
You must not know about me, you must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You must not know about me, (baby) you must not know about me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact he'll be here in a minute 
You can pack all your bags, were finished
'Cause you made your bed now lay in it
I could have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinking 
You're irreplaceable

There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo in so much space
And when you're out there without care, yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice
That's my only advice
Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha ha ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?
Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me
My heroes had the heart
To lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember
Is thinking, I want to be like them
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little, it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done
But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably

On your way down from the clouds 
Would you hear me if I told you
That my heart  is  with you now 
She's only happy in the sun 
She's only happy in the sun 
Did you find what you were after?
The pain and the laughter brought you to your knees 
But if the sun sets you free, sets you free 
You'll be free indeed, Indeed 
She's only happy in the sun 
She's only happy in the sun 
Every time I hear you laughing, I hear you laughing 
It makes me cry 
Like the story of life, of your life 
Is hello, goodbye 
She's only happy in the sun 
She's only happy in the sun

You know how to keep me smiling

And animal aggres-sion is my downfall.

My faith in you is clear
So I say once again
This world's beautiful
Let us celebrate life that is so beautiful
So beautiful...
Take a little time baby
See the butterflies' colors
Listen to the birds that sent to sing for me and you
Can you feel me
This is such a wonderful place to me
Even if there is pain now
Everything will be alright
For as long as the world still turns
There will be night and day
Can you hear me
There's a rainbow always after the rain

 I should have held on tight

I was stupid
I was lying to myself
 I couldn't have fathomed that I would ever
 Never imagined I'd be
 'Guess I didn't know you
'Guess I didn't know me
I never felt
 The feeling that I'm feeling
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
Oh, what I wouldn't give
Right here, 'cause baby
When you left
I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
 Come back baby please, 'cause
We belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on
When times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place?

We belong together

'If you think you're lonely now'
This is too deep, too deep
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial
Trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you
And it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together
But I'm falling apart
I'm feeling all out of my element
Trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what
Need you back in my life (in my life, in my life), baby
When you left
I lost a part of me

Once it was so right when we were at our high
Waiting for you in the hotel at night
I knew I hadn't met my match but every moment we could snatch
I dont know why I got so attached
It' s my responsibility and you dont owe nothing to me
But to walk away, I have no capacity

the sun goes down
He takes the day
but I'm grown
And in your way
in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own
I dont understand, why do I stress the man
When there's so many better things at hand
We could a never had it all, we had to hit a wall
So this is inevitable withdrawal
Even if I stop wanting you, a perspective pushes through
I' ll be some next man' s other woman soon
I cannot play myself again, I should just be my own best friend
Not **** myself in the head with stupid men
He walks away,
the sun goes down
He takes the day
but I'm grown
And in your way
in this blue shade
My tears dry on their own
So we are history, your shadow covers me
The sky above, a blaze
I wish I could sing no regrets and no emotional debts
'Cause as we kiss goodbye the sun sets
So we are history, the shadow covers me
The sky above a blaze that only lovers see
He walks away,
the sun goes down
He takes the day
but I'm grown
And in your way

My tears dry on their own

the sun goes down
He takes the day

That's the one that's gonna do it to you
Oh oh oh, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
Waiting for love to walk through the door
I wish I didn't miss you anymore
I can't eat, I can't sleep anymore
Waiting for love to walk through the door
I wish I didn't miss you anymore

 Your style, your smile, your peace mentality
 Lord, have mercy on me, I was blind, now I can see
What a king's supposed to be, baby I feel free, come on and go with me
Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation
Share our situations, temptations, education, relaxations
Elevations, maybe we can talk about Surah 31:18
Your background it ain't squeaky clean shit
Sometimes we all got to swim upstream
You ain't no saint, we all are sinners
But you put your good foot down and make your soul a winner
I respect that, man you're so phat, and you're all that, plus supreme
Then you're humble, man I'm numb with your feeling, I can feel everything that you bring
Let's take a long walk around the park after dark
Find a spot for us to spark
Conversation, verbal elation, stimulation
Share our situations, temptations, education, relaxations
Elevations, maybe we can talk about Revelation 3:17
Or maybe we can see a movie
Or maybe we can see a play on Saturday
Or maybe we can roll a tree and feel the breeze and listen to a symphony
Or maybe chill and just be, or maybe
Maybe we can take a cruise and listen to the Roots or maybe eat some passion fruit
Or maybe cry to the blues
Or maybe we could just be silent
Come on, come on

You told me how proud you were – but I walked away
If only I knew - what I know today
I would hold you in my arms
I would take the pain away
Thank you for all you've done
Forgive all your mistakes
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To hear your voice again
Sometimes I wanna call you
But I know you won't be there
Ohh I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself by hurting you
Some days I feel broke inside but I won't admit
Sometimes I just wanna hide – cause it's you I miss
And it's so hard to say goodbye - when comes to this
Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohhohhohhohh
Would you tell me I was wrong
Would you help me understand
Are you looking down upon me
Are you proud of who I am
There's nothing I wouldn't do
To have just one more chance
To look into you eyes
And see you are looking back
Ohh I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself, ohhohh
If I had just one more day
I would tell you how much that I missed you since you've been away
Ohh it's dangerous
It's so out of line
To try and turn back time
I'm sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself

State of humanity
I wear it on my shoulder

For better days to come

To come home before the sun

Un po' mi manca l'aria che tirava,
O semplicemente la tua bianca schiena,   nananana
E quell'orologio non girava
Stava fermo sempre da mattina a sera.
come me lui ti fissava.
Io non piango mai per te
Non farò niente di simile   non mai!  nononono
Si, lo ammetto, un po' ti penso
Ma mi scanso
Non mi tocchi più.
Solo che pensavo a quanto è inutile farneticare
E credere di stare bene quando è inverno e te
Togli le tue mani calde
Non mi abbracci e mi ripeti che son grande,
mi ricordi che rivivo in tante cose  nananana
Case, libri, auto, viaggi, fogli di giornale
Che anche se non valgo niente perlomeno a te
Ti permetto di sognare
E se hai voglia, di lasciarti camminare
Scusa, sai, non ti vorrei mai disturbare
Ma vuoi dirmi come questo può finire?
Non melo so spiegare  io,
Non me lo so spiegare
La notte fonda e la luna piena
Ci offrivano da dono solo l'atmosfera
Ma l'amavo e l'amo ancora
Ogni dettaglio è aria che mi manca
E se sto così sarà la primavera
Ma non regge più la scusa  nooo.
Solo che pensavo a quanto è inutile farneticare
E credere di stare bene quando è inverno e te
Togli le tue mani calde
Non mi abbracci e mi ripeti che son grande,

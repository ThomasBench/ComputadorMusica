0,The Man Ill Never Find,Lucius,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lucius/the-man-ill-never-find-chords-4153366,"I'm gonna love you
Any day now
And I'll believe it
Believe it when I say it out loud
Digging through the hurt
That I'll never find
Digging through the hurt
Trying to make 'em mine
I'm looking for the man that
I'll never find
I'll know it when I look him dead in the eye
Don't want it if it's easy
But I wish it was, believe me
I'm looking for the man that
I'll never find
I'm gonna please you
Any day now
Be the one who needs you
Any day now
And every time that I wake up
You'll be the first thing to cross my mind
But right now, I wish that it was worth all the work and I wasn't tired
I can't just stop and try to fix it if I know that it was never right
I'm looking for the man that I'll never find
I'll know it when I look him dead in the eye
Don't want it if it's easy
But I wish it was, believe me
I'm looking for the man that I'll never find
I thought that it would be you
I wanted it to be you
And I'm sorry, I was always looking
For the man that I'll never find
I thought I knew it when I looked you dead in the eye
Don't want it if it's easy
But I wish it was, believe me
I'm looking for the man that I'll never find
I'll know it when I look him dead in the eye
Don't want it if it's easy
But I wish it was, believe me
I'm looking for the man that I'll never find
I'm looking for the man that I'll never find
I'm wishing that man was you tonight

1,Petrified,Omar Apollo,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/omar-apollo/petrified-chords-4156027,"The bedspread was silk, but the marbles were stiff
He showed me my face, so I loosened my grip
A shadow came down, told me I live a lie
Thinking of you more each day
I'm thinking 'bout all the words you say to me
A stranger convinced me to cancel my trip
He sang me a song, but it didn't exist
He said an angel came down and gave him a melody
Thinking of you more each day
I'm thinking 'bout all the words you say to me
I believe in making up
I believе in making up
And I believe in what I fеar
Lately I've been able to see more clear
Thinking of you more each day
I'm thinking 'bout all the words you say to me

You'll say that I'm the only one

With a hundred thoughts
""Maybe he knows who I am""
She walks down the hall with her head down low
Scared to meet his eyes
Even when she hears his voice
She swarmed with butterflies
It's impossible to get you off my mind
I think about a hundred thoughts and you are 99
I've understood that you will never be mine
And that's fine I'm just breaking inside
He always walks the crowded halls
And is blinded by this light
A girl who keeps her head down low
And never shows her eyes
He's tried to talk to her
But there's no easy way
'Cause every time he raises his voice
She runs away
Oh, it's impossible to get you off my mind
I think about a hundred thoughts and you are 99
I've understood that you will never be mine
And that's fine I'm just breaking inside
One day
Maybe she'll stay
And start to head over his way
And one day
She'll look into his eyes
And instead of breaking
She'll call him mine
One day
He'll grab her by the waist
And force them to meet face to face
One day
He'll look into her eyes
And say that ""you're my only light""
Oh, it's impossible to get you off my mind
I think about a hundred thoughts and you are 99
Maybe there's a chance that you will be mine
But right now... I'm just broken inside

Actin' out ""Love the Way You Lie""
But the shit just went awry
Hit me in the eye, bit me in the thigh, then begin to cry
I'm at the end of my wits, let's end this, ma (It's over)
Then begin again tomorrow
Fresh start, let you spoil me
Pledge your loyalty, treat me like a king
Just to fuck me over royally
Boy, are we water mixed with oil
See another shouting match, 'bout to have it out
But no matter how mad I get, I'm so mad about you
Forgot what I was even mad about
I know we've had our challenges still
I keep trying to salvage it, you
Wanna sabotage it, I'm down to the hill
But you think I'm fucking around on you, chill
It never changes, I doubt if it will
Cheat on me, then say ""How does it feel?""
I feel like blowing my fucking head off
After I write you out of my will
Bitch, how could you?
Almost had a child wit' you
Woulda settled down wit' you
Now I'll put you in the ground and bury myself wit' you
I don't get you, it's as if you're drowning
I stick my hand out, but you fool me
You're just trying to pull me down wit' you (Down wit' you)
Thought it was you my world revolve around
I should aim a revolver round at you
180 proof, guess I'm making my way to the roof
You're a traitor, I say that we're through
You hop in the elevator, then you
Say the coffin, they better make it for two
'Cause if you jump, I'm jumpin' with you
And neither one of us have nothing to lose but each other
We're just a couple of fools
You make me wanna jump off the roof
'Cause I love you to death, just like a fool
We'll need a coffin, handmade for two
'Cause I love you to death, just like a fool

'Cause I love you to death, just like a fool
We'll need a coffin, handmade for two

Life isn't like the movies, but it sure will make you cry
When it dawns on you it's time to say goodbye

Then things are going bad for me
  We’re in this thing together
I couldn't think of a better team
  And when the world gets heavy
The weight has got you down on your knees
  It’s okay to say “eff it”
If you just remember this melody

Ohhh, ohhh

Ohhh, ohhh
When the cloud’s above your head
And the sun’s not breaking through
You know I’ll be there to sing this song for you

From the feeling of being surrounded by pictures of mountains
Everyone's right here on my phone
So why do I still feel so alone?
A waltz with no partner
Nobody's holding your hand
A duet's just a solo
If the harmony is all in your head
I thought that I knew what a mountain was like
'till I stood in the valley and looked up at the sky
And I felt my heart beating faster
That feeling I've been chasing after
Something that no one can capture
In pictures of mountains

She said ""Mr Hollywood, won't you come back soon? (Ayy, ayy)
Ooh, I just wanna lay right by your side
We don’t gotta love each other right
We just gotta make it through the night
You don't gotta        say you're not into me no more
When we pass out on the floor
See the sun rise through the door
By the way you move, I know you want me to
Tell you all the rules I know I'm searching too
Give me all your clues and things to guide me through
The end of the world, the end of thе world
Don't blow out the fuse when darknеss comes to light
So much I could do to make you come to life
Fingers coming loose, I see there’s no more time
Don't tell me I'm gone, don't tell me I'm gone

0,Officially Missing You (ver 2),Tamia,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tamia/officially-missing-you-chords-702766,"All I hear is raindrops, falling on the rooftop
Oh baby, tell me why'd you have to go
'Cause this pain I feel, it won't go away
And today I'm officially missing you
    I thought that from this heartache, I could escape
But I've fronted long enough to know
There ain't no way
And today I'm officially missing you
Ooh, can't nobody do it like you
Said every little thing you do,    hey, baby
Said it stays on my mind
And I-I'm officially...
All I do is lay around, two years full of tears
From looking at your face on the wall
Just a week ago you were my baby
Now I don't even know you at all, I don't know you at all
Well I wish that you would call me right now
So that I could get through to you somehow
But I guess it's safe to say baby safe to say
That I'm officially missing you
Ooh, can't nobody do it like you
Said every little thing you do,    hey, baby
Said it stays on my mind
And I-I'm officially...
Well, I thought I could just get over you, baby
But I see that's something I just can't do
From the way you would hold me
To the sweet things you told me
I just can't find a way to let go of you
Ooh, can't nobody do it like you
Said every little thing you do,    hey, baby
Said it stays on my mind
And I-I'm officially...

1,Crazy In Love,Beyoncé,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/1109675,"I look and stare so deep in your eyes, 
I touch on you more and more every time, 
When you leave I'm begging you not to go, 
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain, 
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame. 
Just how your love your doing no one else can. 
Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's 
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch 
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss  
Looking so crazy in love's, 
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love. 
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no 
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no 
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no 
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no 
When I talk to my friends so quietly, 
Who he think he is? Look at what you did to me, 
If you ain't there ain't nobody else to impress, 
The way that you know what I thought I knew, 
It's the beat my heart skips when I'm with you, 
Just how the love your doing no one else can. 
Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's 
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch (you're in love) 
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss (hey!) 
Looking so crazy in love's, (hey) 
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love.

Got me looking, so crazy, my baby 
I'm not myself, lately I'm foolish, I don't do this, 
I've been playing myself, baby I don't care 
'Cuz your love's got the best of me, 
And baby you're making a fool of me, 
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees, 
'Cuz baby you got me, you got me, so crazy baby 
Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's (oh love) 
Got me looking so crazy right now, your touch 
Got me hoping you'll page me right now, your kiss (baby)

Luhaan, sugatan, 'di mapakinabangan

Kung 'di mo lang alam
Sana'y nagtanong ka lang

Ako'y nandito lang, hindi mo lang alam
Matalino ka naman

Ay tunay na bigo sa laro na ito
Ay dapat bang sumuko
Sana hindi ka na lang pala aking nakilala
Kung alam ko lang ako'y masasaktan ng ganito

We flyin' first class
Up in the sky
Poppin' champagne
Livin' my life
In the fast lane
And I won't change

The glamorous,
The glamorous, glamorous (The glamorous life)
For the Glamorous, oh flossy flossy (the flossy flossy)
The glamorous,
The glamorous, glamorous (the glamorous life)
By the Glamorous, oh flossy flossy (the flossy flossy)
Wear them gold and diamonds rings
All them things don't mean a thing
Chaperones and limosines
Shopping for expensive things
I be on the movie screens
Magazines and boogie scenes
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine
I'm no queen, I'm no machine
I still go to Taco Bell
Drive through, raw as hell
I don't care, I'm still real
No matter how many records I sell
After the show or after the Grammys
I like to go cool out with the family
Sippin', reminiscing on days when I had a Mustang
And now I'm in...
Up in the sky
Poppin' champagne
Livin' my life
In the fast lane
And I won't change
For the Glamorous, oh the flossy flossy

I'm talking Champagne wishes, caviar dreams
You deserve nothing but all the finer things
Now this whole world has no clue what to do with us
I've got enough money in the bank for the two of us
Plus I gotta keep enough lettuce
To support your shoe fetish
Lifestyles so rich and famous
Robin Leach will get jealous
Half a million for the stones
Taking trips from here to Rome

I got problems up to here
I've got people in my ear
Telling me these crazy things
That I don't want to know
I got money in the bank
And I'd really like to thank
All the fans, I'd like to thank
Thank you really though
Cause I remember yesterday
When I dreamt about the days
When I'd rock on mtv, that be really dope
Damn, It's been a long road
And the industry is cold
I'm glad my daddy tell me so
He let his daughter know.

Och definitivt inte sista
Det brukar bubbla från start
Med spännande prat
Romantiska möten med kyssar

Hans irriterande tics
Han är royalist

Most of my days are spent alone.

From the place I was born.
But when she wakes me,
She takes me back home.

I spend like a child.
Who's afraid of ghosts in my mind.

I'm still afraid to turn on the lights.

Stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body

Took her for a drink on Tuesday

 While I was thinking, I didn't have a clue.
 Tough to sort files,  with your voice in my head.
 So then I bribed you downstairs, with a Marlboro Red.
So now I feel so small, discover-ing you knew.
 How much more torture would you have put me through?
You probably saw me laughing at all your jokes.
Or how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes.
 And although my pride, yeah, is not easy  to dis-turb,
 You sent me flying, when you kicked me to the kerb.
 With your battered jeans, and your Beasties tee,
 Now I can't work like this,  with you next to me.
 And although he is no -thing,  in the scheme of my years,
 It just serves to bludgeon,  my futile tears.
 And I'm not used to this;   I observe, I don't chase.
 But now I'm sick with conse-quences, thrust in my face.
And the melodramas of my day de-livery blows,
That surpass your re-jection; it just goes to show.
A simple attraction, that reflects right back to me,
So I'm not as into you, as I ap-pear to be.
 And although my pride, yeah, is not easy  to dis-turb,
 You sent me flying, when you kicked me to the kerb.
 With your battered jeans, and your Beasties tee,
 Now I can't work like this,  with you next to me.
 His message was bru-tal,    but the delivery was kind.
 Maybe if I get this down, I'll get it off my mind.
 It serves to con-dition me,     and smoothen my kinks,
 Despite my frus-tration, for the way that he thinks.
And I knew the speech, when it came, would be to that effect,
At least you're attracted to me, which I did not expect.
Didn't think you'd get my number down and such,
But I've never hated myself for my age, so much.
 And although my pride, yeah, is not easy  to dis-turb,
 You sent me flying, when you kicked me to the kerb.

Are you shoppin' anywhere, changed the color of your hair, are you busy?
And did you have to pay that fine you was dodging all the time are you still dizzy?

 I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine;
He's tried to make me go to rehab; I won't go, go, go.
 I'd rather be at home with Ray, I ain't got seventy days.
'Cos there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me,
That I can't learn from Mr Hathaway.
 I didn't get a lot in class,
But I know it don't come in a shot glass.
They try to make me go to rehab; I say no, no, no,
 I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine;
He's tried to make me go to rehab; I won't go, go, go.
 The man said why do you think you here? I said; I got no idea.
 I'm gonna, I'm gonna, lose my baby,
 So I always keep a bottle near.
 He said I just think you're depressed,
 Yes me, yeah baby and the rest.
They try to make me go to rehab; I say no, no, no,
 I don't ever want to drink again,
 I just, ooh I just, need a friend.
 I'm not gonna spend ten weeks,
And have everyone think I've gone mad.
 And it's not just my pride;
 It's just 'till these tears have dried.
They try to make me go to rehab; I say no, no, no,
 I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine;
He's tried to make me go to rehab; I won't go, go, go.
 Meet you downstairs in the bar, and heard,
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt.
You say why did you do it with him today?
And sniff me out like I was Tanqueray.
 'Cos you're my fella, my guy;
 Hand me your Stella and fly.
 By the time I'm out the door,
You tear me down like Roger Moore.
 I cheated myself, like I knew I would.
I told ya, I was trouble; you know that I'm no good.
 Upstairs in bed with my ex boy;
 He's in the place, but I can't get joy.
 Thinking of you in the final throws;
 This is when my buzzer goes.
 Run out to meet your chips and bitter,
 You say when we're married, 'cos you're not bitter.
 There'll be none of him no more;
I cried for you on the kitchen floor.
 I cheated myself, like I knew I would.
I told ya, I was trouble; you know that I'm no good.
 Sweet reunion, Ja-maica and Spain;
 We're like how we were again.
 I'm in the tub; you on the seat,
 Lick your lips, as I soak my feet.
 Then you notice lickle carpet burn;
 My stomach drops yeah and my guts churn.
 You shrug, and it's the worst,
To truly stuck the knife in first.
 I cheated myself, like I knew I would.
I told ya, I was trouble; you know that I'm no good.
 I cheated myself, like I knew I would.
I told ya, I was trouble; you know that I'm no good.
 Nobody stands in between me and my man,
It's me And Mr Jones, (me and Mr Jones).
 What kind of fuckery is this?
You made me miss the Slick Rick gig. (Oh Slick Rick).
 And thought I didn't love you when I did, (when I did).
Can't be-lieve you played me out like that.
No you ain't worth guest list,
Plus one of all them girls you kiss, (all them girls).
 You can't keep lying to your-self like this (to your-self).
Can't be-lieve you played your-self  like this.
 Rulers one thing, but come Brixton,
 Nobody stands in be-tween me and my man,
'Cos it's me and Mr Jones, (Me and Mr Jones).
What kind of fuckery are we?
Nowa-days you don't mean dick to me, (dick to me).
I might let you make it up to me, (make it up).
Who's playing Saturday?
 What kind of fuckery are you?
Side from Sammy you're my best black Jew.
But I could swear that we were through, (we were through).
I still want to wonder 'bout the things you do.
 Mr   Destiny, nine and fourteen.
 Nobody stands in be-tween me and my man,
'Cos it's me and Mr Jones, me and Mr Jones...
 He left no time to re-gret,
Kept his dick wet, with his same old safe bet.
 Me... and my head high,
And my tears dry; get on without my guy.
 You went back to what you knew,
So far removed, from all that we went through.
And I... tread a troubled track,
My odds are stacked; I'll go back to black.
 We only said goodbye with words; I died a hundred times.
 You go back to her and I go back to...I go back to us.
 I love you much,
It's not e-nough; you love blow and I love puff.
And life is like a pipe,
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside.
 We only said goodbye with words; I died a hundred times.
 You go back to her and I go back to...
 We only said goodbye with words; I died a hundred times.
 You go back to her and I go back to...
 Black... black,
 Black... black.
 Black... black,
 Black... I go back to... I go back to...
 We only said goodbye with words; I died a hundred times.
 You go back to her and I go back to...
 We only said goodbye with words; I died a hundred times.
 You go back to her and I go back to black.
 For you I was a flame; love is a losing game.
 Five story fire as you came; love is a losing game.
 One I wish I never played; oh what a mess we made.
And now the final frame; love is a losing game.
 Played out by the band; love is a losing hand.
 More than I could stand; love is a losing hand.
 Self professed, profound; 'till the chips were down.
Know you’re a gambling man; love is a losing hand.
 Though I'm rather blind; love is a fate resigned.
 Memories mar my mind; love is a fate resigned.
 Over futile odds, and laughed at by the gods.
And now the final frame; love is a losing game.
 All I can ever be to you, is a darkness that we knew,
And this regret I got ac-customed to.
 Once it was so right, when we were at our high,
 Waiting for you in the ho-tel at night.
I knew I hadn't met my match, but every moment we could snatch.
I don't know why I got so attached.
It's my responsibility, and you don't owe nothing to me,
But to walk away; I have no ca-pacity.
 He walks a-way; the sun goes down.
 He takes the day, but I'm grown.
And in your grey, in this blue shade,
My tears dry on their own.
 I don't understand; why do I stress a man,
When there's so many better things at hand?
We could a never had it all; we had to hit a wall,
So this is in-evita-ble withdrawal.
Even if I stop wanting you, a per-spective pushes through,
I'll be some next man's other woman soon.
I can't play myself again, I should just be my own best friend,
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men.
 He walks a-way; the sun goes down.
 He takes the day, but I'm grown.
And in your grey, in this blue shade,
My tears dry on their own.
So we are history; your shadow covers me, the sky above, a blaze...
 He    walks away; the sun goes down.
 He takes the day, but I'm grown.
And in your grey, in this blue shade, my tears dry on their own.
I wish I could say no regrets, and no e-motional debts,
'Cos as we kiss good-bye the sun sets.
So we are history; the shadow covers me,
The sky above a blaze that only lovers see.
 He walks a-way; the sun goes down.
 He takes the day, but I'm grown.
And in your grey, in this blue shade,
My tears dry on their own.
 He walks a-way; the sun goes down.
 He takes the day, but I'm grown.
And in your grey, in this blue shade,
My tears dry on their own.
 He walks a-way; the sun goes down.
 He takes the day, but I'm grown.
And in your grey, in this blue shade,
My tears dry...
 It's okay in the day; I'm staying busy.
 Tied up enough so I don't have to wonder where is he.
Got so sick of crying, so just lately;
When I catch myself, I do a 1-80.
 I stay up clean the house; at least I'm not drinking.
 Run around just so I don't have to think a-bout thinking.
That silent sense of content that everyone gets,
 Just disappears soon as the sun sets.
 This face in my dreams, seizes my guts;
 He floods me with dread.
 Soaked in soul, he swims in my eyes, by the bed.
 Pour myself over him; moon spilling in,
 And I wake up a-lone.
 If I was my heart, I'd rather be restless.
The second I stop, the sleep catches up and I'm breathless.
This ache in my chest, as my day is done now.
The dark covers me and I cannot run now.
 My blood running cold; I stand before him.
 It's all I can do to as-sure him.
When he comes to me, I drip for him tonight.
 Drowning in me, we bathe under blue light.
 This face in my dreams, seizes my guts;
 He floods me with dread.
 Soaked in soul, he swims in my eyes by the bed.
 Pour myself over him; moon spilling in,
 And I wake up a-lone.
 And I wake up a-lone.
 And I wake up a-lone.
 And I wake up a-lone.
 If my man was fighting, some unholy war;
I would be be-hind him.
Straight, shook up beside him, with strength he didn't know.
It's you I'm fighting for.
 He can't lose with me in tow, I refuse to let him go.
 At his side and drunk on pride, we wait for the blo-ow.
 We put it in writing, but who you writing for?
Just us on kitchen floor.
Justice done, reciting, my stomach standing still,
Like you're reading my will.
 He still stands, in spite of what his scars say,
 I'll battle, 'till this bit-ter finale.
 Just me, my dignity, and this guitar case.
 Yes, if my man is fighting, some un-holy war,
And I will stand beside you.
But who you fighting for? B, I would have died too; I'd of liked to.
If my man was fight-ing,
Some un-holy war.
If my man was fighting.
 He can only hold her for so long,
 The lights are on but no-one's home.
 She is so vacant, her soul is taken,
 He thinks; what's she running from?
Now, how can he have her heart, when it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her, 'cos what's inside her never dies.
 Even if she's con-tent in his warmth,
 She gets plagued with her urgency.
 Urgent kisses, the miss misses,
 The man that he longs to be.
Now, how can he have her heart, when it got stole?
So he tries to pacify her, 'cos what's inside her never dies.
So he tries to pacify her, 'cos what's inside her never dies.
So he tries to pacify her, 'cos what's inside her never dies.
 Tell your boyfriend, next time he around,
To buy his own weed and don't wear my shit down.
 I wouldn't care if bre would give me some more.
 I'd rather him leave you then leave him my draw.
When you smoke all my weed man,
You got's to call the Green Man.
So I can get mine, and you get yours.
 Once is enough, to make me attack,
So bring me a bag and your man can come back.
 I'll check him at the door; make sure he got green,
 I'm tighter than Airport Security teams.
When you smoke all my weed man,
You got's to call the Green Man.
So I can get mine, and you get yours.
 I'm my own man, so when will you learn,
That you got a man but I got's to burn?
 Don't make no difference if I end up alone;
 I'd rather have myself a-smoke my home grown.
 It's got me ad-dicted;
Does more than any dick did.

Three little birds, sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete
Maybe sometimes, we've got it wrong, but it's alright
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Oh, don't you hesitate
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow
Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in the bar by the roadside
(just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Got to love that afro hair do
Maybe sometimes, we feel afraid, but it's alright
The more you stay the same, the more they seem to change
Don't you think it's strange?
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow
'Twas more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realize, that you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

Used to feel like may

Till it happens to you
Went to the old flat
Guess I was trying to turn the clock back
How come that nothing feels the same now when I'm with you
We used to stay up all night in the kitchen
When our love was new
Oooh love I'm a fool to believe in you

it must have been about quarter past three,
In front of me stood a beautiful honey
with a beautiful body,
I said it'd cost her her name, six digit number
and a date with me tomorrow at nine.
Did she decline? No.
Didn't she mind? I don't think so.
Was it for real? Damn sure.
What was the deal? A pretty girl aged 24.
So was she keen? She couldn't wait.
Cinnamon queen? Let me update.
What did she say? She said she'd love to, rendezvous.

said we'd start with a bottle of moet for two.

we were making love by Wednesday,
and on Thursday and Friday and Saturday we chilled on Sunday.

she'd love to unfold me all night long.
Ooh, I loved the way she kicked it
from the front to back she flipped it.
(back she flipped it, ooh the way she kicked it)
And I oh oh I yeah, hope that she'd care,
'cause I'm a man who'll always be there.
Ooh yeah, I'm not a man to play around, baby.
Ooh yeah, 'cause a one night stand isn't really fair.
From the first impression girl hmm,
'Cause there's no need to chat
for there'll be plenty for that.
From the subway to my home,
endless ringing of my phone.
When you feeling all alone,
all you gotta do is just call me, call me.

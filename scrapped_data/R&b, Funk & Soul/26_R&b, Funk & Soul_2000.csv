0,Feuer,Jan Delay,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jan-delay/feuer-chords-556099,"  In allen Ecken hocken Menschen 
  Mit einem riesengroßen Schlauch
  Sie wollen dein Feuer löschen
  Und darum lauern sie dir auf
  Die einen feiern nur das Gestern
  Und spritzen mit Vergangenheit
  Andre meinen Kohle wirkt noch besser
  Und sprühen Euros in die Flammen rein
Denn das Wichtigste ist,Dass das Feuer nicht aufhört zu brennen
    Denn sonst wird es ganz bitterlich kalt
    Ja, die Flammen im Herzen,die sind durch nichts zu ersetzen
 Darum halt sie am Laufen mit aller Gewalt
  Manche wollen keine Experimente
  Bei Risiko da ham sie Angst
  Sie löschen mit sicherer Rente
  Und Verträgen mit der Allianz
  Aus einem Schlauch kommt Langeweile
  Bei denen ist gar nichts mehr los
  Alle Aus einem anderm tut es schneien
  Denn die ersticken die Flammen mit Koks
Denn das Wichtigste ist,Dass das Feuer nicht aufhört zu brennen
    Denn sonst wird es ganz bitterlich kalt
    Ja, die Flammen im Herzen,die sind durch nichts zu ersetzen
 Darum halt sie am Laufen mit aller Gewalt
  Und dann die Menschen ohne Rückgrat
  Den Schlauf voll mit Kompromissen
  Doch zum Glück ändern die Wichser
  Ständig das Ziel auf das sie schießen
  Und die Courtney Loves und Yoko Onos
  Ja, die brauchen gar keinen Schlauch
  Denn sie nehmen dein Feuer, egal wie groß
  Und sie, sie saugen es einfach aus
Ja das Wichtigste ist,Dass das Feuer nicht aufhört zu brennen
    Denn sonst wird es ganz bitterlich kalt
    Denn, das Feuer im Herzen, das ist durch nichts zu ersetzen
    Also halt es am Laufen mit aller Gewalt

I used to sit alone at night, with no one else to care
I was staring at the TV screen, and all night I’ll be there
But you came into my life and all has changed
So thanks for bringing love around again
I never used to go outside of my atmosphere
But darling, here you are, it seems we’re going everywhere
And I finally get to see the rainbow then
So thanks for bringing love around again
I sing this song of love to you, ‘cause it’s also true
It’s love   through and through,       inspired by you
     It sure do mean a lot to me, my friend
Yeah, thanks for bringing love around a gain
I used to spend all my time wondering what went wrong
But you had patience and you said no wait would be too long
      And you’re still by me till all sorrow’ll end.
Girl, thanks for bringing love around a gain.
There’s a brand new feeling inside, my love has new pride.
I owe this to you,         for being so true.
And I never ever want this love affair to end.
      I used to sit a lone at night,   with no one to care.
So I thank you baby… for bringing love around a gain.
I stare into the TV screen,    and all night I’ll be there.
So I thank you baby…   for bringing love around a gain.
    Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, baby,
I thank you for bringing love around again.

But no one wins if we both walk away,
And we hate being the people we became,

A moment of her time just seems impossible to me
It's hard to find the words, to get to know this stranger
I'm scared of what she'll say if what I say sounds incomplete
And it feels like we belong together
Can someone tell me where do I start
Cause, I can't keep on feelin' the way I do
I can't keep on, hiding my heart from you
I got to say something before
Someone else comes through,
I can't keep on loving you,
From a distance
She's always on my mind, there's no room left for thinking
I'm tired of waiting slowly fading at least I'm happy now
Cause I'm running out of time, and I feel this ship is sinking
The doors are closing I am frozen I need her around
And it feels like we belong together
Can someone tell me where do I start
Cause, I can't keep on feelin' the way I do

I need you to show me that I’m not alone
Do you still hear me when I sing for you
Show me you do

Takes his song where he goes
And leaves it there

And once again I'm just hoping It's a text from you
It ain't right, read your messages Twice, thrice, four times a night it's true
Every day I patiently wait Feeling like a fool but I do any way
Nothing can feel as sweet and as real As Knowing I wasn't waiting in vain
And maybe it's true I'm caught up on you
Maybe there's a chance That you're stuck on me too
Maybe I'm wrong, it's all in my head
Maybe we're afraid of Words we both haven't said
I'm always connected on-line
Check face book all the timee Hoping you've checked my profile
Just can't help wondering why you play it cool But see I'm hopelessly falling for you
Every night on my phone I hook up with you And I don't even like it girl
All jokin' aside, what say? You and I Come out and see what we're trying to hide
And maybe it's true I'm caught up on you
Maybe there's a chance That you're stuck on me too
Maybe I'm wrong, it's all in my head
Maybe we're afraid of Words we both haven't said
Like I really want you, I think I need you Baby, I miss you, I'm thinking of you

   Your love is like a gentle breeze upon a brand-new day
   Your kiss and what it does to me
Like a flower needs its rain
We are like one of a kind,
True love is hard to find
I can't go on another day
Just hear me when I say
I ask of you, would you love me,
If nothing else went right?
And I ask of you, would you hold me,
Forever in your life?
And don't let me fall,
Cause I can only give my all
Here I    am   I ask of you
   I found the place where I belong,
It's right here next to you
   And nothing else matters now,
With all we've been through
I can't go on, tryin' to deny
Just what I feel inside
But now before I let go,
You gotta let me know
I ask of you, would you love me,
If nothing else went right?
And I ask of you, would you hold me,
Forever in your life?
And don't let me fall,
Cause I can only give my all
Here I    am   I ask of you
Yes I do
I    ask of you          Whoa
I never really thought
That you'd be all to me
I'd give everything and all I am to you
Oh baby, baby, I know you feel this way too
Oh yeah   I-I-I
Ask of you, when nothing else went right?
And I ask of you,
Forever in your life?
Cause I could only give my all
I   cant pretend
I  ask    of you
   I  ask    of you
   Oh yeah

The tears and pain, but here I go again

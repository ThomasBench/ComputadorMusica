Only leads to nowhere
No one that I know
Nothin I hope to find
Every other way
Seems more like a day
Everyday to last forever
Ooh and every night I dream
That we are back together
Vowing that we never
Be apart again
How mean it all can seem
But then I awaken
With the same old aching
In my heart again
Crying I will come to you
If you where the call
If I have to crawl
Every mile

She was so pretty; Emma was a star in everyone's eyes,
And when she said she'd be a movie queen, nobody laughed,
Her face like an angel; she could be anything.
 Emmalene, Emma, Emmalene,
I'm gonna write your name high on that silver screen.
Emmalene, Emma, Emmalene,
I'm gonna make you the biggest star this world has ever seen.
At seventeen, we were wed,
And worked day and night to earn our daily bread.
And every day Emma would go out searching for that play,
That never ever came her way.
You know sometimes she'd come home so depressed,
I'd hear her crying in the back room, feeling so distressed.
And I'd remember back when she was five,
To the words that used to make Emmalene come alive. It was... 
 Emmalene, Emma, Emmalene,
I'm gonna write your name high on that silver screen.
Emmalene, Emma, Emmalene,
I'm gonna make you the biggest star this world has ever seen.
It was cold and dark De-cember night,
When I opened the bedroom door,
To find her lying still and cold up-on the bed;
A love letter lying on the bedroom floor.
It read; ""Darling, I love you,
But I just can't keep on living on dreams no more"".
""I tried so very hard not to leave you alone;
I just can't keep on tryin' no more"".
Emma-lene,
Oh, Emmalene.

Your precious love's burning ember

Always been to me, Baby, a long time friend
Been a long, long winter. Glad we're lovers again
Way back long ago, we made a vow
I don't quite remember now
But it ended, P.S. I love you, Baby
I'm pledging my heart on you once again
Just to be your man
Give us some kind of chance 'Cause I love you, Baby
I love you long as I can remember
Precious love's burning ember
Together, Baby, how can we lose
        We are united, Baby, long time lovers, No need to fight it but rediscover

Could the sound of her voice take me higher
Could the smile on her face light my fire
Could a hand in my hand inspire me

Upside down

I don't have far to fall
but that didn't help at all

To get you for myself

Were tantalizing me
Push some pride aside

I could run and hide

Really are but few

Me act like a fool
Stand and stare
See the jokers actin'
Like there's nothin' happenin'

Summer breezes
Through the trees
As on and on it goes
They begin to reminisce
He walks her home
And then a kiss
The rest is known
And so we leave our hero
No longer batting zero
He's in the majors now

I'm walkin' to New Orleans,
I'm going to need two pair o' shoes,
When I get through walkin' to you.
When I get back to New Orleans.
I've got my suitcase in my hand,
Now, ain't that a shame?
I'm leavin' here today.
Yes, I'm goin' back home to stay,
Yes, I'm walkin' to New Orleans.
You used to be my honey,
Till you spent all my money.
No use for you to cry,
I'll see you bye and bye.
Cause I'm walkin' to New Orleans.
I've got no time for talkin',
I've got to keep on walkin',
New Orleans is my home,
That's the reason why I'm goin',
Yes, I'm walkin' to New Orleans.

Are you still mine?

To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers sigh: “Wait for me, wait for me,
I'll be coming home, wait for me!”

Hangin' on, with a push and shove
Possession is the motivation
That is hangin' up the God-damn nation
Looks like we always end up in a rut (everybody now!)
Slaughterhouse is killin' hogs
Twisted children killin' frogs
Poor dumb rednecks rollin' logs
Tired old ladies kissin' dogs
Hate the human, love that stinking mutt (I can't stand it!)
The President, he's got his war
Folks don't know just what it's for
Nobody gives us rhyme or reason
Have one doubt, they call it treason
With chicken feathers   all the way out one nut  (God damn it!)
Church on Sunday, sleep and nod
Tryin' to duck the wrath of God
Preacher's fillin' us with fright
Tryin' to tell us what he thinks is right
He really got to be some kind of nut (I can't use it!)
Where's that bee and where's that honey?
Where's my God and where's my money
Unreal values, crass distortion
Unwed mothers need abortion
Kind of brings to mind ol' young King Tut (He did it now)

Lives an old   Captain's daughter
By the banks of the old river Rhine
Where I loved her and left her
Now I    can't forget her,     She is my pretty Fraulein

Walk down   by the river
Each night,   when the stars began to shine
By the same stars above you
I swear   that I love you
You are my pretty Fraulein

Each day I grow fonder
Of the sweetheart that I  left behind
In a moment of my glory   her face   comes before me

I dreamed about them cotton fields and home.
I dreamed about my Mother, dear old Pappy,
sister and brother..and I dreamed about that girl,
who`s been waiting for so long.
I wanna go home..I wanna go home.
Oh, how I wanna go home.
Home folks think I`m big in Detroit City.
From the letters that I write, they think I`m just fine.
But by day, I make the cars, and by night, I make the bars.
If only they could read between the lines.
Cause you know I rode a freight train north,
to Detroit City.
And after all these years I find, I`ve just been 
wasting my time.
You know what I`m gonna do?..I`m gonna take my foolish pride,
get it on a southbound freight and let it ride.
I`m gonna go back to the loved ones..the ones that I left
I wanna go home..I wanna go home.
Oh, how I wanna go home.

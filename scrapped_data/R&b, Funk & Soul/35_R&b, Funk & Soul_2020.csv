Seh' du erntest viel Kritik, find', dass du sie nicht verdienst
Welcher Mann wird kritisiert für großer Arsch in enger Jeans?
Mein Onkel sagt, die Haare blond färben wär' nicht okay
Doch gleichzeitig trägt er ein Toupet
Disney Prinzessin, der Grund warum ich mich für meine Nase schäm'
Noch vier Jahre, dann zum Doktor, ich spar' schon auf die OP (ah)
Hoffe, du gehst nächstes Jahr mal auf Tournee
Lieb deinen Song mit Xavier, doch dass er offline ist, kann ich verstehen

Doch beim Handstand meinen Arsch berühren, findet er echt witzig
Die tun alle, als hättest du mich in mei'm Herz vergiftet (woah)
Doch sind selbst der Grund, warum ich so genervt am Mittagstisch sitz'
Leb' in 'ner Kleinstadt, jeden Tag Monotonie
Die Jungs in der Klasse machen Witze voll Homophobie
Nenn mich eine Hure, kaum zeig' ich zu viel Haut
Deshalb hör ich auf dem Nachhauseweg immer „HOES UP, G'S DOWN“
Weiß, wie man sich schminkt und teure Mode anzieht (yeah, yeah)
Auch ohne Shirin David, die mit der Provokation spielt
Denn was ich sonst lern', ist nur das Verhalten einer Hausfrau
Hoffe, diese Nachricht geht nicht in dei'm Postfach unter
Denn schreibst du mir zurück, würde mein allergrößter Wunsch wahr
Die haben mich überhört, bekamen nie ein Wort mit
Sagten mir: „Benimm dich und halte dich an die Vorschrift“ (yeah, yeah)

20,Phantom Regret By Jim,The Weeknd,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-weeknd/phantom-regret-by-jim-chords-4018390," You're tuned to Dawn FM
 The middle of nowhere on your dial
 So sit back and unpack
 You may be here a while
 Now that all future plans have been postponed
 And it's time to look back on the things you thought you owned
 Do you remember them well?
Were you high or just stoned?
And how many grudges did you take to your grave?
When you weren't liked or followed, how did you behave?
Was it often a dissonant chord you were strumming?
Were you ever in tune with the song life was humming?
If pain's living on when your body's long gone
And your phantom regret hasn't let it go yet
You may not have died in the way that you must
All specters are haunted by their own lack of trust
 When you're all out of time, there's nothing but space
No hunting, no gathering
No nations, no race
 And Heaven is closer than those tears on your face
 When the purple rain falls
We are all bathed in its grace
 Heaven's for those who let go of regret
And you have to wait here when you're not all there yet
But you could be there by the end of this song
Where The Weeknd's so good and he plays all week long
Bang a gong, get it on
And if your broken heart's heavy when you step on the scale
You'll be lighter than air when they pull back the veil
 Consider the flowers, they don't try to look right
 They just open their petals and turn to the light
 Are you listening real close?
Heaven's not that, it's this
It's the depth of this moment
We don't reach for bliss, God knows life is chaos
But He made one thing true
You gotta unwind your mind
Train your soul to align
 And dance 'til you find that divine boogaloo
 In other words
 You gotta be Heaven
 To see Heaven
 May peace be with you

Love so big, I give him my all
East or South, we're dreamin' it all
 She love me, fair, come baby, 'cause your tall
Build bricks and the sticks, can we remake though?
Invest in my flow 'til my young boy lookin' your Brooklyn robe
Back then used to boot, like we do up pro
Now it's flimsy 'part from the block, bad days
'Cause we show down shows (Shows)
Should I choose that Gucci or LV coat?
Yo, I'm black in the hood unclothed
The bando's boomin', my pastry comes from rotatin' phones
Gon' step to the hoods, gon' clear
So much patience is greatness, call me bacon
Don't go [?], know practice makes perfect
Girl, if you don't know, leave it to me, I'm cool
Started out a country girl while he heading [?]
Had to change a couple schools 'cause I wasn't fittin' in
Take it straight to London, dream it big and let it grow
Just so you know
Feel so alone when the city gets cold
I've known that I'd make it since I was a young girl
The world is right there, I hear it calling
But home is a place that makes my heart sing
You're not alone
  I'll wait 'til the end of time
 Open your mind
  Surely it's plain to see
You're not alone
  I'll wait 'til the end of time for you
 Open your mind
   Surely it's time to be with me

Cheat a little

47,Hurt You Gus,BENEE,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/benee/hurt-you-gus-chords-4096867,"Tell me how you feel about us
You say you have issues with trust
But we've both experienced love
And I don't want you to go now
It's a new day, I've woken up next to you again
Think I might keep you if you'd be keen to stay
You change your mind 'cause maybe you're just not the guy
Maybe I'm stupid to think that you were right
.. Maybe I'm stupid to think that you were right
.. Maybe I'm stupid to think that you were right
I can see that you're slowly loosening up
Wanna know that you're all in no one else
Rest assured I won't hurt you Gus
And I don't want you to go now
It's a new day, I've woken up next to you again
Think I might keep you if you'd be keen to stay
You change your mind 'cause maybe you're just not the guy
Maybe I'm stupid to think that you were right
.. Maybe I'm stupid to think that you were right
.. Maybe I'm stupid to think that you were right

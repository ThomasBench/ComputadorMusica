  Ground is glowing, I’m slowing my stride with every step
  Electric rivers flow by the silhouette trees
And all my new friends dazzle like they’re royals
What is this place?
The skies are vast and no one’s a familiar face
Kinda feeling brave
The winds of change have nothing on this switchblade faith
Ooh, ooh, ooh
The night is young and it’s wild
On the crown of a mountain and I could keep goin’ for miles
Good with a blade and some old-fashioned faith in a place like this
Feeling bulletproof and far from faces I don’t miss
And I’m feeling brave
The winds of change have nothing on this switchblade faith

Money make me happy every time I count it
Who needs love, when I come around flexin'?

I don't need no stressin', phone call, textin'
Don't kiss me, bitch, kiss my necklace
Who needs love? Ayy
Baby, who needs love?           Ayy
I got 20/20 vision when I see her
Pulled up in the Lamb', should've pulled up in the BM
Rippers in my denim 'cause a young nigga was flexin'
And if we end it early, baby girl, then it was destined
I even had to stop, answerin' your calls
A nigga had you trappin' with the scammers and the dawgs
Drivin' over border with the hammers in the car
When the cops pulled me over, would've hand it to my dawgs
I mean, who needs love with these hammers in my fists?
And she don't fuck me over, give a damn about a bitch
Debit, credit cards on me, slammin' in this bitch
Don't wanna take her back, she did the damage in this bitch
Tell me, who needs love?
Who needs love? Ayy

I said, I was doin' wrong back when you was livin' right
Cool a couple milli' sittin' with me on the flight, ayy
Tryna get me back and fuckin' niggas out of spite
And you sittin' on that nigga dick when it don't sit right with ya
Had to tell her, look here though
You could fuck a thousand niggas, only thing that's finna be hurt is your pussy, ho
And if I get at it, baby girl, you know I'm superstar status
Don't you ever try to play me like a rookie, though
Big, big dreams got you sittin' in a mansion
Laid up in my covers while you thinkin' 'bout expansion
Can't believe you even fucked that nigga, he a random
Had me embarrassed to tell the story to the mandem
Shawty, I ain't worried 'bout no nigga drip, I'm drippin' the best
The Cullinan seats orange, 'cause it's drippin' Hermès
No matter what she tellin' you, fuck, I dicked her the best
Fuck the drama, I put dick in her chest, yes

All round round your head, all round round your head
Pullin' down backstreets, deep in your head
Slippin through dreamland like a tourist
Pullin' down backstreets, deep in your head
Slippin' through dreamland like a tourist
You've had too much of the digital love
You want everything live, you want things you can touch
Make it feel like a movie you saw in your youth
Make it feel like that song that just unopened you
You were ten years old, holdin' hands in the classroom
He had a gun on the first day of high school
You want something bizarre, old conceptual cars
You want girls dressed in drag, you want boys with guitars
Pullin' down backstreets, deep in your head
Slippin' through dreamland like a tourist
Pullin' down backstreets, deep in your head
Slippin' through dreamland like a tourist
You see in Kodachrome, you see pink and gold
You see Mulholland glow, you see in airplane mode
All round round your head, all round round your head
All round round your head, all round round your head
You float in the pool where the soundtrack is canned
You go ask your questions like, ""What makes a man?""
Oh, it's 2020, so it's time to change that
So you go make an album and call it Dreamland

Hope you don't miss me at night

Can't get enough
 Can't get enough, can't get enough
Lost in this experience
Tested every day
Love's the big experiment
One my heart can't take
Funny when I think of it all
 Funny how I felt when we met
Funny how you threw me way off
 Funny how you think of me, funnier than me
Feeling from a place I can't understand
 Can't believe I let you know me
Showed you what is deep
Down, oh

        Woi-oi
Ayy
I don't cop things for resale, don't do iCloud, don't do email
Feds wanna tap up man and wire up man like Chubbs did Detail
Back when Ricky was doin' up Teesdale, I was doin' dinner with Teezy
I didn't trust no one, swore gyal lined me 'cause gyal too greazy
Niko never move neeky, sweatsuit Nike, sweatsuit DG
If man get beaky, ring ring, call up GiGi, do him up neatly
Used to look up to a man from certain ends with tune on repeat
Thought he was a bad boy, then 'til man got pinched and man went PC
Man went PC just like Dell and Windows, some man been those
Before I was ever around Kendall's, I was at ends though, dreamin' up Enzos
The woman I do end up with has to be a bad gyal just like Munchy
Can't have no pretentious ting when I know this road gets bumpy
Word to the broski Jay, he got different names in different countries
Three waps in the whip and we beat that case, where man live way too comfy
I don't do well with people makin' disses or makin' threats
Woi-oi, man got flown like private jets, for way, way less
I know you tried to get one down on us, ever since then it's been stress
'Cause you know the rest 'dem owe you one and we always pay them debts
Wassa, wassa, just like the crodie Pressa, I don't do no passa
Link with Skull and Cuz and Jamie ah yard and we deh pon Gaza
Pasha Sasha pissed, I was way too young at the time for slashings
You niggas spend too much time on captions, not enough time on action
Pick one man with slaps that's rappin', I bet he don't want no clashings
The LV pouch on chest is just for fashion, niggas just actin'
Are you dumb or stupid? The wheels on the Rolls is Chromazz, headshot domazz
Just checked in at a hotel, floor that we on got potent aromas
OVOXO link up, mandem drink up, me and the drillers
Hawk and Sticks and Cash and Baka, Gucci, P, and Gilla
And the boy that sound like he sang on Thriller, you know that's been my nigga
Yeah, we just had to fix things, family, 6ix tings, we can't split up
As for the rest of the game, I'll do man dirty, man'll get two time
To me, that's just our side, I don't really care who rides on whose side
Bring ten shots to the poolside, never seen none of these grown men outside
4301, won't spare no one, niggas gotta know about Southside
Steppin' outta line, get outlined, and you know I'm tied up stateside
Bringin' man down when they take sides, tryna get saved by the bell like Bayside
Prince, I carry that last name, that shit stays on me like brand names
Jas just lined up brand new hand tings and nice guy on a madting
Everyone I know has codenames, anyone I'm beefin' with is a no-name
Niggas can't even win home games, they just gotta fall in line like Soul Train

I wanna make you feel the weight's off your shoulders too
I'll take it
Just tell me it can't be that crazy
And even if it is that crazy, baby
I'll take it
I want you, I know you're not an angel
Not you
Oooh, just save it
Don't waste your time

And I don't want you to miss me
'Cause there's no way that you're sorry
And you're crying and you're sayin' things

Ride dirty like Pimp C
You a real ten-speed freak, shawty
You was everything a nigga need
You was everything to me, my love
Why you keep that little shit from me?
Left me down on bended knee
The only time a nigga ever made you take a backseat
Why you do that little shit to me, shawty?
When you know that we was meant to be
Why'd you keep those things from me, my love? (Love)
I've given you enough time

Trust
Hurtin' deeply, deeply
Thought I knew the real, then they flipped
How many times did I ask about this, on God?

I'm a dynasty
The pain in my vein is hereditary

Dynasty
And if that's all that I'm gonna be

Too gone, to carry on
You can't hide it in the walls
Sweep it under marble floors

Passed on down family lines

I nearly gave it away for the sake of my sanity

Mother and father, I know you risked everything
Fighting about money and his infidelity

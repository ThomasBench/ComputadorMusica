Make a one man weep, make another man sing
Change a heart to a little white dove
More than a feeling, that's the power of love
Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream
Stronger and harder than a bad girls dream
Make a bad one good, mmm make a wrong right
Power of love will keep you home at night
       Don't need money,         don't take fame
       Don't need no credit card to ride this train
       It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
       But it might just save your life
       That's the power of love
       That's the power of love
First time you feel it might make you sad
Next time you feel it might make you mad
But you'll be glad baby when you've found
That's the power that makes the world go round
       Don't need money,         don't take fame
       Don't need no credit card to ride this train
       It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
       But it might just save your life
    They say that all in love is fair
Yeah but you don't care
   But you know what to do
   When it gets hold of you
   And with a little help from above
       That's the power of love
       That's the power of love

      Can you feel it?!
     Don't take money,             don't take fame

I lied and told her she'll be fine
Though we both knew it was just a lie
I had to do it
Coz I had said anything to help me get through it.
And she reached out for my hand
And her simple touch was more than I could 
And I had to turn away coz I knew
All the hurt that she was feeling, I was 
feeling too
Coz when it falls apart
There's no easy way to break somebody's heart. 
She could've gotten angry
And made me feel like a guilty child
But I realized that never was her style
I wanted her to hurt me
And not treat me like a friend
I wanted her to say ""there'd be someday
I'd come crawling on my knees to ask her 
back again""
But she acted like a lady till the end
Oh, what a lady!
I thought that she'd bring down
But she smiled at me and never made a

And I guess she understood in her way
Coz her silence told me everything she 
could not say

    Looking back, I could have done it differently,
    won a few more moments, who can tell?
    But it took time to understand the man,
    now at least I know, I know him well.
Wasn't it good (wasn't it good)?
Wasn't it fine (wasn't it fine)?
Isn't it madness?  He can't be mine.
But in the end, he needs a little bit more than before,
Security (he needs his fantasy and freedom)
I know him so well!
    No one in your life is with you constantly,
    no one is completely on your side.
    And though I move my world to be with him,
    still the gap between us is too wide.
    Looking back, I could've played it differently,
    learned about the man before I fell. 
    But I was ever so much younger then,
    now at least I know, I know him well.
Wasn't it good (oh, so good)?
Wasn't it fine (so fine)?
Isn't it madness?  He can't be mine.
    Didn't I know, how it would go?
    If I knew from the start
    Why am I falling apart?
Wasn't it fine (so fine)?
Isn't it madness?  He can't be mine.
But in the end, he needs a little bit more than before,
Security (he needs his fantasy and freedom)
I know him so well!
It took some time to understand him
Ooh, I know him so well.

   De esos ojazos negros de un raro fulgor
   que me dominan e incitan al amor
   eres un encanto
   eres mi ilusión

   que es de los mortales el consuelo al morir
   bendito Dios porque al tenerte yo en vida
   no necesito ir al cielo tisú

Just a friend of mine, just a friend of mine
They talked a little, drank a lot as the evening went by
The place got crowded and the air too hot, he said: let's go out for a while
The night was clear and the wind was soft as they walked side by side

Just a friend of mine, just a friend of mine
He was nice and gentle, still rough enough to keep her satisfied

  You done me wrong...
  It was just like a dream
  You let all my friends come over and meet
And you were so strange
  You didn't have the decency
To change the sheets
Oh girl, when you were mine
  I used to let you wear all  my clothes
You were so fine (so fine)
  Maybe that's the reason
That it hurt me so
I know (I know)
That you're going with another guy
  Don't care (don't care)
‘cause I love you, baby, that's no lie
  I love you more than I did
When you were mine

  You were kinda sorta my   best friend
So I was blind (so bli-ind)
I let you fool around...
  I never cared (didn't care)
  I never was the kind to make  a fuss
When he was there
 Sleeping in between the two of us

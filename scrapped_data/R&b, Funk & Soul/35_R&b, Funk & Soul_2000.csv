0,Water And A Flame (ver 2),Daniel Merriweather,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/daniel-merriweather/water-and-a-flame-chords-1236037,"Seven days has gone so fast
I really thought the pain would pass
It's been nearly an hour
Since I thought of you
But you're not answering the phone
I'd settle for a busy tone
At least by that I'd know that you're okay
A girl like you ain't meant to go away oh
Now youre gone, theres nothing else I want
Now that it's over over, theres nothing else I want
What have I done, looks like I was wrong
Is everything really meant to change
I guess we're like water and flame, water and flame
I'm tired of this empty house,
I need a drink to get me out.
A couple more til I forget your name.
I saw a boy that looked like you,
I didn't know quite what to do,
It took a power of will to break my stare.
I realized what I wanted wasn't there.
If you see me coming...
I look away, I look away...
And if your mind is made up...
I look away, I will look away...
If your worry bound
I'm okay, I'm okay, yes I am
All this sorrow and this pain,
is going to go away

And waste the day
You give yourself
You give yourself away
I know that when you started
You liked the way you felt
And yes I understand you
But to everybody else...
It's black and white
To you it's grey
You know I'll love you anyway
But it seems to me you're living on the run
But I hope you know you're not the only one
Who lives by night
Lives by night
They're only trying to chase away the sun
And when you play
The way you do
The sun don't shine
The same way for you
And you say you don't abuse it
But baby I can tell
We both know what the truth is
But to everybody else...

And you can't come back can't come back, can't come back again
And you start breaking down
In the pouring rain
Well you've been on a fast train
When your lover has gone away don't it make you feel sad
And you go on a journey way into the land
And you start breaking down
'Cos you're under the strain
And you jump on
Yeah you jump on a fast train

I'd be in the ground or somewhere on the run
Take a look before they close the book
At the other side of the coin
Yes, there's much in life for which I could atone
But let him without sin cast the first stone
But before you do, there's still one more point of view
On the other side of the coin
I'm just a man sometimes foolish and proud
Too quick they say to play up to the crowd
But before you judge me, if judge ye must
Take your time, be sure that the verdict is just
Before you do, there's one point of view
Can you stand up and say justice was done today
And that I was wrong, so wrong, before you see what's on
The other side of the coin
Yes there's much for which in life I should atone
But let them without sin get up and cast the first stone
And before you do remember there's still one more point of view

I got your message by the way
I'm calling in sick today
So let's go out for old time sake
I'll never forget you

And you're always wearing black
I was so serious
You know my boyfriend's mummy's nearly had a heart attack

Did you miss me
I've borrowed your silver boots
Now if you just let me
I'll never forget you

Don't make him choose between us
Oh, remember the words that I told you, yeah
He's gonna resent you when he's older

Can you tell him the truth, about me and you
Or will you tell lies cause it's easy to do
  You have to know that it's not a game

My blood runs through his veins
  Just because you and I weren't happy
Doesn't change the fact that I'm his Daddy
So swallow your pride, he needs me in his life
  See I need him as every bit as much as you

and time just lingers and no one knows
He's got eyes, he's got ears
He's got all of his fingers, and all of his toes
His is a life of observation
Maybe one day he'll get to translate this information
For twenty years, he hasn't spoken a word
He's been silent since the accident occured
While so many people taken tongues for granted
Taking the truth, finding ways to slant it
I know a man who'd know what to do
And so many people go day in and day out
just dreaming of things they can bitch about
I know a man who'd know what to do
It's a dream, for him it's real
but it never goes away and never will
He's in touch with what he feels
Oh but he just can't say, ""Maybe it's better still""
His is a life of endless frustration
He's got his pride, he's not exempt from humiliation
Can't lift a finger to stop what's wrong
He can't lift a leg to dance to a Beatles song
While so many people taking spines for granted
Slither and squirm, taking what they're handed
I know a man who'd know what to do
And so many people go day by day
Sitting on their hands, constantly complaining
I know a man who'd know what to do
And so many content to exist like sheep
Never scratching the surface of themselves too deep

Never realizing what our lives could be

Glaub an dich und schöpfe Vertrauen und Kraft aus deiner Familie
Die Nacht für Nacht deine Seele bewacht und dich liebt
Ganz egal, was du tust, was geschieht, die dich wie eine Hülle umgibt
Wenn du dieses Glück hast, hast du fast gesiegt, fast gesiegt
Manches Leben läuft schnell, es ist nicht immer hell
Es ist schwer was zu seh'n und im Dunkeln zu geh'n, doch
  Sei dir bewusst: deine Vorfahren hatten schwerste Wege
Und wenn dein Herz noch für sie schlägt, dann weißt du genau, dass ihr Blut durch dich fließt
Es macht dich sogar schlau durch Talente, die du kriegst,
Die sich dein Clan vielleicht vor 300 Jahr'n
Durch schwere Arbeit hart erwarb, auf was du jetzt zurückgreifen kannst
Zurück in der Zeit, back in time
Du verfügst über Wissen von mehr als 10.000 Jahr'n
Frag deine Ahn', deine Vorfahr'n
Sie heißen Vorfahr'n obwohl du vorfährst
Sie können nur ahnen, wo du sie hinfährst
Hast du den Plan oder bist du verkehrt?
Dann kehre in dich, lass dich geh'n
Du musst deine Seele von innen seh'n
Du musst die Familiengruft bei Tag begehen
Obwohl du nicht tot bist, frag ich dich: Bist du am Leben
Bist du am Leben, bist du am Leben, bist du am Leben, bist du am Leben

Lasst uns diese Lieder rausbring'!
Ob alt oder jung, ob blind ob stumm
Die ohne Zeit oder die mit Geduld
Sieh dich an, schau dich um
Auch du bist ein Mensch aus Fleisch und Blut
Aber auch wie das Küken aus der frischen Brut
Spürt ihr wie der Krieg uns nicht gut tut
Eine ganze Generation schöpft Mut
Die ganze Generation einer Nation
Setzt sich den Frieden wie auf einen Thron
Die ihr den Krieg liebt, was wisst ihr schon?
Ihr liebt eure Kinder nicht wie Tochter und Sohn
Liebt eure Kinder wie Korn, Rind und Huhn
Ich sag dir: Liebe hat damit nichts zu tun
Wer den Krieg liebt, erntet von mir Hohn
Lautes Gelächter und lauteres Drohen
In Form von Liedern, die Herzen durchbohr'n
Mögen die in der Hölle schmor'n
Die Selbstmordattentäter auserkor'n
Um ihre Drecksarbeit zu tun
Mögen sie nie in Frieden ruh'n

Est-ce pour ma paix ou pour la tienne hou
Et si tu veux on peut même aller plus loin
S'avouer nos petits caprices
Je vois un sourire au coin
Tu vois t'as l'air moins triste
On te l'a déjà dit
Mais si tu veux mon avis
Aujourd'hui on dit beaucoup plus qu'on ne vit
Toi et moi on peut faire ensemble
toi et moi c'est fou ce qu'on se ressemble
Toi et moi on peut faire ensemble
Toi et moi c'est fou ce qu'on se ressemble
J'ignore bien des choses sur toi
 Ca ne me tuera pas d'apprendre
 Tu sais que c'est pas vrai
 Tout ce qu'on dit de moi
 Parle-moi tu vas comprendre
Et si tu veux confie-moi tes convictions
 Je partagerais mes peines
 En fin de soirée on chantera la même chanson 
Avec la conscience plus saine 
On te l'a déjà dit
Mais si tu veux mon avis
 Aujourd'hui on dit beaucoup plus qu'on ne vit
 Toi et moi on peut faire ensemble
 Toi et moi c'est fou ce qu'on se ressemble
 Toi et moi on peut faire ensemble
 Toi et moi c'est fou ce qu'on se ressemble
 Maintenant qu'on sait d'où on vient
 Je veux savoir où on va
 Ca ne peut faire que du bien
 Juste faire le petit pas
 Peut-être le monde suivra
 Toi et moi on peut faire ensemble
 Toi et moi c'est fou ce qu'on se ressemble
 Toi et moi on peut faire ensemble
 Toi et moi c'est fou ce qu'on se ressemble

Fall down...

That you're just a puppet show
And the little boy inside
Often sits at home alone
And cries, cries, cries, cries
Who's gonna love you when
It all falls down, and
Who's gonna love you when
Your bankroll runs out
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over
When the star of the
Show isn't you anymore
Your pain is so deep rooted
What will your life become
Sure you hide it
But you're lost and lonesome
Still just a frail shook one

But, at least I know where I can turn
When I'm in my times of need
Just as long (As I know all things are possible and)
Just as long as I       believe     (believe)
Oh, yes
I've loved a lot, hurt a lot
Been burned a lot        in my life and times
Spent precious years wrapped up in fears
With no end in sight
Until my    sav-ing grace shined on meeee-hee-ee-he
Until my sav-ing grace set me free
Giving me peace
Giving me strength when I'd
Al----most lost it all
I still exist because you kept me safe
I found my   sa-ving grace within you
Yes, I've been bruised
Grew up confused
I've seen life from many sides
Been stigmatiz-ed
Been black and white
Felt inferior inside
Un--til my    sav-ing grace shined on meeee-hee-ee-he
Until my sav-ing grace set me free
Giving me peace
Giving me strength when I'd
Al----most lost it all
I still exist because you kept me safe
I found my   sa-ving grace within you
And the bountiful things that you do
Lord thank you (lord thank you)
For deliver-ing me
And giving me peace
Giving me strength
Giving me hope when I'd
Almost lost it all
I still exist because you kept me safe
Al--ways my    sav-ing grace
Pulls me throughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I found my saving grace within you

(Only you)
My saving grace Lord is

46,Subtle Invitation,Mariah Carey,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/mariah-carey/subtle-invitation-chords-3362186,"See it's hard to tell somebody
That you're still somewhat
Attached to the dream
Of being in love once again
When it's clear they've moved on
So I sat down and wrote these few words
On the off chance you'd hear
And if you happen to be somewhere listening
You should know I'm still here
If you really need me
Downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush in
What can I say, I had a little extra time
So I figured I might as well explain
A couple little things to you
     Even though life goes on
If you really need me
Downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush in
And then my love will flow
Like the waves to the shore
Once again effortlessly
And I'll comfort you so
Your heart won't hurt anymore
I'm waiting patiently
If you really need me
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush in
(If you really need me baby)
If you really need me
Baby, just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to
Be Downhearted again
Is call me and let love rush in

Cause of the lighting in your bedspring showers
I can feel the mist everytime we kissed
Just didn't know a downpour like this
There's a flash flood warning
Till we wake up in the morning
There'll be puddles in the bed

Girl the rain is coming

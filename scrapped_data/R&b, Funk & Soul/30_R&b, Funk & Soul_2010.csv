0,Sink Into The Floor,Feng Suave,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/feng-suave/sink-into-the-floor-chords-2721534,"Oh love, you know I swear I saw you in the night again
Cause, oh love, girl since you left I haven't drawn a single breath
Maybe it's just a daydream
'Cause I've been feeling like I'm floating above the rooms I'm in
 Wake up, what a night
The perfect night to sink into the floor and die
It's no love,     but close enough
It's only fun but just because your clothes are off
And oh love, I'm mostly numb
I'm lonely 'cause you know you were my only one
You should know I don't love you
Don't think that I don't know
People come and go
  But now I feel I'm on the atmosphere alone
Oh love, the things you said still echo on inside my head
Maybe it's just a daydream
'Cause I've been feeling like I'm floating above the rooms I'm in
Wake up, what a night
The perfect night to sink into the floor and die
It's no love, but close enough
It's only fun but just because your clothes are off
And oh love, I'm mostly numb
I'm lonely 'cause you know you were my only one
It's no love,    close enough
It's only fun but just because your clothes are off
And oh love, I'm mostly numb
I'm lonely 'cause you know you were my only one
Baby...

Por las mujeres, la pasta y los focos
Me está quitando la vida
Muy poquito a poquito a poco
Me han preguntao' la prensa
Puchito ¿cuál e' la maña?
Sin cantar ni afinar
Pa' que me escuche to'a España
Es un veneno que llevo dentro
En la sangre metido
Que va a hacer que me mate
Sin que me hayas siquiera querido
Lo hice por ti (Eso es)
Lo hice por ti (¿Cómo e'?)
Lo hice por ti (Lo hice por ti, mami)
Lo hice por ti (Vamonos, vamonos)
Lo hice por ti (Pa' que me mires)
Lo hice por ti (Pa' que me quieras)
Lo hice por ti
Yo he nacido bohemio
Pero tu amor me ha cambiado
Y ahora quiero triunfar y ganar
Y salir en la tele y la radio (ey)
Es un veneno cruel y violento
Que estáis alimentando
Que va a hacer que me mate
Mientras todos seguís ahí mirando
Lo hice por ti (¿Cómo e'?)
Lo hice por ti (Eso es)
Lo hice por ti (Por ti mi amor, por ti)
Lo hice por ti (Pa' que me mires)
Lo hice por ti
Lo hice por ti
Lo hice por ti
Aún recuerdo al chaval hambriento
Que no invitabais al baile
Antes cuando era inocente, antes
Pero antes yo no era nadie
Y ahora to'el dí­a metido en farra
Escapando pa'lante
Intentando olvidarte
Toreando recuerdos que arden
Es un veneno que llevo dentro
En la sangre metido
Que va a hacer que me mate
Sin que me hayas siquiera querido
Es un veneno que llevo dentro
En la sangre metido
Que va a hacer que me mate
Sin que me hayas siquiera querido
Lo hice por ti, (Lo hice por ti) (Eso es)
Lo hice por ti, (Lo hice por ti) (Por ti nama')
Lo hice por ti, (Lo hice por ti)

She said, ""You're dancing in the movies""
I almost started to believe her
Then I saw you and I knew
Maybe it's 'cause I got a little bit older
Maybe it's all that I've been through
I'd like to think it's how you lean on my shoulder
And how I see myself with you
I don't say a word
But still, you take my breath and steal the things I know
There you go, saving me from out of the cold
Fire on fire would normally kill us
But this much desire, together, we're winners
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners
But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms
'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you love me
And look in my eye
You are perfection, my only direction
It's fire on fire, mmm
It's fire on fire
When we fight, we fight like lions
But then we love and feel the truth
We lose our minds in a city of roses
We won't abide by any rules
I don't say a word
But still, you take my breath and steal the things I know
There you go, saving me from out of the cold
Fire on fire would normally kill us
But this much desire, together, we're winners
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners

You act like you need remindin'
Tryna do it over, bring it back and rewind it
But all that glitters isn't gold, I was blinded
Should have never gave you my heart on consignment
And I can't believe the lies that I went for
Thought you was mine, but you decided to be with him though
You took my feelings and just threw 'em out the window
Feel like it's too hard to fall in love again, no
On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya
Can you tell me what's with all this distant love?
If I called, would you pick it up?
On some nights like this, I just wanna text you, but for what?
You gon' say you want me, then go switch it up
Just gon' play with my emotions just because, no (Oh)
All them times I played the fool for you
Thinkin' we could put it back together, thought we had forever
You never see my point of view
Our connection is so severed, you don't show no effort
And I can't believe the lies that I went for
Thought you was mine, but you decided to be with him though
You took my feelings and just threw 'em out the window
Feel like it's too hard to fall in love again, no
On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya
Can you tell me what's with all this distant love?
If I called, would you pick it up?
On some nights like this, I just wanna text you, but for what?
You gon' say you want me, then go switch it up
Just gon' play with my emotions just because, no (Oh)
You gon' get my hopes high, girl
You gon' get my hopes high, girl
Just gon' tell me more lies, girl
Just gon' get my hopes high, girl
I've been way too good to you, you take me for granted
You was my day one since back at Big B's house on Adams
First day that we met, I flagged you down, I told you, ""Hit my line""
Used to promise me you'd never switch on me like Gemini
You think I'm a fool, ain't nobody stupid
I see all the signs, I see all the clues
Yeah, sometimes I reminisce 'bout that shit when I'm bingin'
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya (Missin' ya)
Can you tell me what's with all this distant love? (Love)
If I called, would you pick it up?
On some nights like this, I just wanna text you, but for what?
You gon' say you want me, then go switch it up (Switch it up)

Ay hindi na maikubli
Ang pag-asang nahanap ko
Sayong mga mata
At ang takot kong sakali mang
Ika'y mawawala
At ngayon, nandyan ka na

Handa ako sa walang hanggan
'Di paaasahin
'Di ka sasaktan
Mula noon
Hanggang ngayon,

Ay nahanap ko na rin
Ang aking tanging hinihiling
Pangako sa'yo
Na ika'y uunahin
At hindi naitatanggi
Ang tadhanang nahanap ko
Sa'yong pagmamahal
Ang dudulot sa pag ibig
Natin na magtatagal
At ngayon, nandyan ka na

'Di ka na mag-iisa
Sa hirap at ginhawa
Ay iibigin ka

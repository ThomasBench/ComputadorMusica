And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's a cure
You can rest your mind assured
That I'll be lovin' you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be lovin' you always
Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky  (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that it's the day that I'm no more
Did you know that true love asks for nothing
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
That last through forever Another day
As today I know I'm living for tomorrow
Couldn't make me be the past but that I mustn't fear
Now I know deep in my mind
The love of me I left behind
And I'll be loving you always
Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphins fly and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that it's the day that I'm no more

44,You Are Not Alone (ver 5),Michael Jackson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/michael-jackson/you-are-not-alone-chords-1413841,"Intro: 
Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be? You're not here with me 
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why 
Did you have to go, and leave my world so cold 
Everyday I sit and ask myself : How did love slip away? 
Something whispers in my ear and says  
You are not alone, I'm here with you 
Though you far away, I'm here to stay 
But, You are not alone, for I am here with you, 
Though we're apart, you're always in my heart.. 
But, You are not Alone.. 
No.... 
Lone, why? 
No....
Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry 
Asking me to come, and hold you in my arms.. 
I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear 
But first I need your hand, then forever can begin
Everyday I sit and ask myself : How did love slip away? 
Something whispers in my ear and says that...  
Oh, whisper three words and I'll come flying...
And girl you know that I'll be there 
I'll be there.. 
You are not alone, I'm here with you 
Though you far away, I'm here to stay 
But, You are not alone, for I am here with you, 
Though we're apart, you're always in my heart.. 
You are not alone, I'm here with you 
Though you far away, I'm here to stay 
But, You are not alone, for I am here with you, 
Though we're apart, you're always in my heart.. 
But, You are not Alone.. 
This is my second tab..

45,As Time Goes By,Tom Jones,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tom-jones/as-time-goes-by-chords-3769229,"You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by
And when two lovers woo
They still say: ""I love you""
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by
Moonlight and love songs never out of date
Hearts full of passion jealousy and hate
Woman needs man and man must have his mate that
No one can deny
It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by
It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by

And I’m an ever spinning top, whirling around till I drop
Oh but what am I to do, my mind is in a whirlpool
Give me a little hope, one small thing to cling to, yeah
You got me going in circles, oh around and round I go
Going in circles, oh around and round I go
I'm strung out over you baby, yeah over you   ooh ooh
I’m a faceless clock,  with timeless hopes that never stop (never, never)
When I feel that way (yeah baby), you know you know my soul my soul's at stake (you know)

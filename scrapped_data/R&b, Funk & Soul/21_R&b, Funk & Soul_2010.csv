I don't want to be your cigarette
I don't want to be your ashtray
I don't want to be your doormat
All o' sudden you're not into me
And maybe it's not deliberate
And I know you never asked me
I just gotta put it out there
I don’t put myself out there usually I stay tucked away
Cause I was a loner until I met you
And I let you in after all the persuasion
Mind games, manipulations.
That's why I'd rather be a loner
Yeah I'd rather be alone
I don't even want to know ya
I don't want to be known
Cause I'd rather be a loner
I'd much rather be alone
Baby it was nice to know ya
Packing up and leaving home.
No I don't want to be your cigarette
Use me up then toss me, step on me
I don't want to be an option
Avoidin' interactions cause I just wanna get away
And maybe you got a full plate
Know I'm cookin' something better                                 
but if you don't want me now
Don't try to come eat with me
Cause I was a loner until I met you
And I let you in after all the persuasion
headaches and allegations.
That's why I'd rather be a loner
Yeah I'd rather be alone
I don't even want to know ya
I don't want to be known
Cause I'd rather be a loner
I'd much rather be alone
Baby it was nice to know ya
Packing up and leaving home.

All the colours of love and of life ever more
Evermore (I  see  me through your eyes)
I see me through your eyes

Your love shines the way into paradise
So I offer my life as a sacrifice
And live through your love

Then I can't trust my words
Accepting it's not my fault but I'm the one to blame
And I know I've got to change
And no, I'm not ashamed
  You've given me all of your time
You've been there for all of my crimes
You've shown me there's flaws in blue skies
Only you, only you
So don't you wonder why
I won't say goodbye
I won't even cry
It will all make sense tomorrow
Why I can't sleep at night
I won't even cry
It will all make sense tomorrow
  Patiently there for me when I'm full speed ahead
And it's all been in my head, I need to get out of your bed
Well no one can understand confusion like I do
These blue days are my truth
There's silence in my room
  You've been there for all of my crimes
Only you, only you
So don't you wonder why
I won't say goodbye
I won't even cry
It will all make sense tomorrow
Why I can't sleep at night
I won't even cry
It will all make sense tomorrow
I've said what I can
But do you hear it? Do I know who I am?
Will you believe me that I won't do you wrong?
That's what I've done all along
By finding myself I nearly lost it all
By fighting your help I thought I knew it all
I'm lying alone and now I know it all
So don't you wonder why
I won't say goodbye
I won't even cry
It will all make sense tomorrow
Why I can't sleep at night
I won't even cry
(Why, bye, cry)
It will all make sense tomorrow
(Why, bye, cry)
It will all make sense tomorrow

​When you gonna take your hands off me?
​When you ever gonna let me be
​Proud of who I am?
​Oh, insecurity
​When you gonna take your hands off me?
​When you ever gonna let me be
​Just the way I am?
Dear insecurity
I hate the way you make me feel
I hate the things you make me think
​You make me sick to my stomach
​I wish that I wasn't me
​Some days, when I wake up I see myself in the mirror
I feel like what shouldn't be couldn't be clearer
​My nose to my clothes, from my chin to my skin
I'll never be good enough ever again
For you, so I changed for you
Then I'd died for you, then you made me blue
​If I were you, I'd hate me too
​But I already feel like you do
Because​, you tell me I'm not worth shit
And the bad luck's on purpose
  And if I'm sad then I deserve it
But underneath the surface
I'm hurting, searching and learning
 My imperfections make me perfect
Dear insecurity
​When you gonna take your hands off me?
​When you ever gonna let me be
​Proud of who I am?
​Oh, insecurity
​When you gonna take your hands off me?
​When you ever gonna let me be

Dear insecurity
I ​feel like I'm dying on the inside
I'm a mess, I'm depressed, I'm alone and it's all my fault
​Did i do something wrong? This feeling's unfair
You're making me anxious but why the fuck do I care?
I overthink everything til' my thoughts are impaired
I hate everything about me I think I need some air
Drink some water, take a breath
Take a moment to be thankful for the reasons that you're blessed
It's not about mistakes you made or failures that you had
​It's all about the memories and little things you have
Your freckles and flaws to your body and bruises
​Your scars to your beautiful ​birth marks, ​the truth is
​We're one in the same
So play the cards that you're dealt
Nobody likes you more than when you're being yourself
Dear insecurity
​When you gonna take your hands off me?
​When you ever gonna let me be
​Proud of who I am?
​Oh, insecurity
​When you gonna take your hands off me?
​When you ever gonna let me be

Dear insecurity
I am
​Proud of the person who I am
Nobody's gon' tell me who I am
Or who i can be
I am
​Taking my life into ​my hands
They're tired of hiding who ​I am
I am me, ​so
Dear insecurity
​When you gonna take your hands off me?
​When you ever gonna let me be
Proud of who I am?

It's time I make you take your handS off me
Set me free, I'm gonna let you see

Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family Feuds, saying Mom's confused
I'm for sure she doesn't wanna learn
My daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishin' only makes it worse
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they only know what you let 'em see

Nowhere like I do

Light gray Silverado
Drive it 'cause you have to
Stay up working late at a job you hate
And fix your makeup in a dirty bathroom
No more love, in and out of clubs
Knowin' what you gotta do
You got plans wrapped in rubber bands
And that's the only thing you never lose

46,3 Nights (ver 2),Dominic Fike,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/dominic-fike/3-nights-chords-2565996,"Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights in the city of palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up
Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights in the city of palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up
Feel like the least of all your problems
You can reach me if you wanna
Stay up tonight, stay up at night
Green lights in your body language
Seems like you could use a little
Company from me
But if you got everything
That figured out like you say
Don't waste a minute, don't wait a minute
It's only a matter of time
For you (ooh-ooh-ooh) to (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Tell me now, 'cause I've been up for
I've been up for
Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights in the city of palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want (want)
And you can call me names if you call me up (call me up)
Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights in the city of palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up (Ooh)
I can't fix each and all your problems
I'm no good with names and faces
And she sent me naked pictures
From her neck down to the waist
I get my feelings involved
She stopped returnin' my calls
Flaws turned into walls and barricades
And I'm too far gone and over both ways
And now every long day is a bad one
I can't make you call or make you stay
Or take you off the pedestal
So I get lost in modern music watchin' movies
Talkin' to the walls in my room
Walkin' through the halls in my head
Just tryna make sure it all makes sense
I ain't made of money
Maybe some day you could take it from me?
I'm up too late, thinkin' bout you
And M.I.A. for
Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights in the city of palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want (want)
And you can call me names if you call me up (call me up)
Three nights at the motel
Under streetlights in the city of palms
Call me what you want, when you want, if you want
And you can call me names if you call me up (Ooh)

But I hope you come back to me
My mind's running wild with you faraway
I still think of you a hundred times a day
I still think of you too if only you knew
When I'm feeling a bit down and I wanna pull through
I look over your photograph
And I think how much I miss you, I miss you
I wish I knew where I was 'cause I don't have a clue
I just need to work out some way of getting me to you
'Cause I will never find a love like ours out here
In a million years, a million years
My location unknown tryna find a way back home to you again
Gotta get back to you gotta gotta get back to you
My location unknown tryna find a way back home to you again

I just need to know that you're safe, given that I'm miles away

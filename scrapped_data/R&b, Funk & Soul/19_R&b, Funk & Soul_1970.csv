And the sun it hurts my eyes 
And something without warning love 
Weighs heavy on my mind 
Then I look at you 
And the whole world seems alright with me 
Just one look at you 
And I know its gonna be 
A lovely day(Lovely day lovely day lovely day a lovely dayx2) 
When the day that lies ahead of me 
Seems impossible to face 
When someone else instead of me 
Always seems to know the way 
Then I look at you 
And the whole world seems alright with me 
Just one look at you 
And I know its gonna be 
A lovely day(Lovely day lovely day lovely day a lovely dayx2) 
Then I look at you 
And the whole world seems alright with me 
Just one look at you 
And I know its gonna be 
A lovely day(Lovely day lovely day lovely day a lovely dayx2)

And so I came to see him,     
and listen for a while.          
And there he was a young boy        
a stranger to my eyes.
Strumming my pain with my fingers.  singing my life with his words.
Killing me softly with his song.  Killing me softly with his song.
Telling my whole life with his words.
Killing me softly,  with his song. 
I felt all flushed with fever 
embarrassed by the crowd.
I felt he found my letters 
and read each one out loud.
I prayed that he would finish
but he just kept right on.
Strumming my pain with my fingers.  singing my life with his words.
Killing me softly with his song.  Killing me softly with his song.
Telling my whole life with his words.
Killing me softly,  with his song. 
He sang as if knew me 
in all my dark despair.
And then he looked right through me
as if I wasn't there.
And he just kept on singing 
sining clear and strong
Strumming my pain with my fingers.  singing my life with his words.
Killing me softly with his song.  Killing me softly with his song.
Telling my whole life with his words.
Killing me softly,  with his song.

 And to the man on whose shoulder the world must de-pend;
I pray for peace and love, A-men.
Ooh, can't ya feel it? Mmm-hmm;

Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December our hearts will see
A world where men are free, mmh
Someday at Christmas, there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time
Someday at Christmas, we'll see a land
With no hungry children, no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
A world where people care, whoa-oh
Someday at Christmas, there'll be no tears
When all men are equal and no men have fears
One shining moment, one prayer away
From our world today, whoa-oh
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where people are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time
Someday at Christmas, man will not fail
Hate will be gone and love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart, whoa-oh

lui saprebbe cosa fare,
lui saprebbe come aggiustare
con un cacciavite in mano fa miracoli.
Ti regolerebbe il minimo
alzandolo un po'
e non picchieresti in testa
così forte no
e potresti ripartire
certamente non volare
ma viaggiare.
Sì viaggiare
evitando le buche più dure,
senza per questo cadere nelle tue paure
gentilmente senza fumo con amore
dolcemente viaggiare
rallentare per poi accelerare
con un ritmo fluente di vita nel cuore
gentilmente senza strappi al motore.
E tornare a viaggiare
e di notte con i fari illuminare
chiaramente la strada per saper dove andare .
Con coraggio gentilmente, gentilmente
dolcemente viaggiare.
Quel gran genio del mio amico,
con le mani sporche d'olio
capirebbe molto meglio;
meglio certo di buttare, riparare
Pulirebbe forse il filtro
soffiandoci un po'
scinderesti poi la gente
quella chiara dalla no
e potresti ripartire
certamente non volare ma viaggiare.

47,I Just Cant Give You Up,Average White Band,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/average-white-band/i-just-cant-give-you-up-chords-2592597,"    Got a message here that I hope you'll understand
    When I met you keepin' my distance was the plan
But hey, I never thought you'd get to me this way
I got you - and that's good
I was so scared that I would fall for you at first
    Holding back with my love just trying to gain your trust
But now I'm not ashamed to say that
You've got my love in your pocket
And I'm hooked - can't you see
I just can't give you up
'Cause I got you in my blood
I just can't give you up
'Cause I got you n my blood
I got to let you know that you really
I'm hooked can't you see
I just can't give you up
'Cause I got you n my blood
I just can't give you up
'Cause I got you in my blood

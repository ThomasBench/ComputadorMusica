Star	child
I thought you came down from  heaven
To  save souls
I thought you came down from  heaven to save us
I thought you came but you  just   don't   take  us
Somewhere in the world tonight
There's a fire blazing bright
Star child
When you gonna come,   when you gonna come
You've got to save us from what we've begun
From what we've begun
So long coming down

1,Hot Tequila Brown,Jamiroquai,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jamiroquai/hot-tequila-brown-chords-2178509,"   How many times
Can a man watch the sun rise
Over his head
Without feeling free
   How many words
Will fail me in my negligence
To arrest oh yes
This crazy part of me
   How many fools
Will I let unlock the door to my heart
When I know that I know that
They shouldn't have had the key
  It's been so long
And the groove in my heart is nearly gone
Oh my head's in the clouds
But I'm landing on my feet
  Don't shoot me down - sun shine shine down
I'm hot tequila brown
  Don't shoot me down - I'm stone cold but I'm lying here
Sun shine shine down
How many lives
Will I lose on the battle lines
Inside of my mind
I think I've had enough
Don't shoot me down
All I want is to see my black eyes turn back to brown
Cross that Rubicon
I think I really must
  Don't shoot me down - sun shine shine down
I'm hot tequila brown
  Don't shoot me down - I'm stone cold but I'm lying here
Sun shine shine down
  Don't shoot me down - sun shine shine down
I'm hot tequila brown
  Don't shoot me down - I'm stone cold but I'm lying here

Watching old black and white films

 I ain't gonna be nobody's fool
 But you, you're the only one that ever got me
 And you, got me feeling like that
 And you like a bullet in my heart
 That shot me right down, boy
 And I can't get enough of that
 So, if you're ready we can take it real slow
 Now that I told you what I want you to know
 I'm waiting patiently for you to agree

Did you think I wouldn't hear it on the vine
I wish that I could press rewind

(It reminded me) Of my favourite restaurant
I can't believe you brought her here
In the same black dress I used to wear

Imagine a life where you can do as you please, Nothing to stop you from living your dream
They say you can accomplish anything, So why not make this a reality
We can rebuild societies, C’mon all you got to do is believe
Right now we’re all too distant, too blind and too resistant
To see the situations we must solve, 
Our lies and cries and misconceptions, throw us in the wrong direction
But if we change a revolution could evolve
Imagine a feeling that’s so unreal, It’s a natural high from the clarity
We can all change society, If we just focus and start to believe
Unnatural disasters off the streets, clear our minds and let the world breathe
This won’t come unless we work as one, ’til we all unite and we get our jobs done
Over the years friendships have died, wars have been fought and tears have been cried
Enough with the hate let’s learn to forgive, rekindle the love and never regret
Colours will fade if we don’t take a stand, the world will turn gray if we’re not hand-in-hand
Let’s stop our fighting, let’s see eye to eye, It’ll be alright, keep our hand up high

Light up a romance.
Wrap your hands in my hands.
Then I hold you. We get closer. And I want you.
And I want to drive you crazy, love.
How can I just let go.
If your eyes say yes, but you won't fall in love?
If I were a painter, you'd be my mona lisa
If I were a scientist baby, Id find the right chemistry
So you say yes to me, and I keep
hanging on, hanging on
Till you say yes to me, say yes to me, say yes.

Till you be my baby

Staring at the canvas, watching the time pass by.

Run my mind through your hair, its only you I see.

So where you been then, don't go all coy, don't turn it round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
These days when I see you, you make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time, when your heart ain't in it, and you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too
Time and time again, I play the role of fool (Just for you)
Even in the daylight when you think that (I don't see you)
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find

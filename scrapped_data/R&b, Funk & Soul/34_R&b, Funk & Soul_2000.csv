0,King Of Sorrow (ver 3),Sade,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/sade/king-of-sorrow-chords-3169271,"I'm cryin' everyone's tears
And they're inside our private war I died the night before
And all of these remnants of joy and disaster
What am I supposed to do?
I want to cook you a soup that warms your soul
But nothin' would change, nothin' would change at all
It's just a day that brings it all about
Just another day    and nothin's any good
The D.J's playin' the same song
I have so much to do, I have to carry on
I wonder if this grief will ever let me g-o-o
I feel like I am the King       of Sorrow
The King of Sorrow
I suppose I could just walk away
Will I disappoint my future if I stay
It's just a day that brings it all about
Just another day     and nothin's any good
The D.J's playin' the same song
I have so much to do, I have to carry on
I wonder will this grief ever be gone
      Will, it ever go
I'm the King of Sorrow
The King of Sorrow
I'm cryin' everyone's tears
I have already paid for all my future sins
There's nothing anyone      can say to take this away
It's just another day      and nothin's any good
          I'm the King     of sorrow
King of sorrow
King of sorrow
King of sorrow
Of sorrow
King of sorrow
King of sorrow
King of sorrow

The moon and I were talk-ing

She promised you her light
That you so graace-fully carry
You bring your light… and shine, like
morning
And then the wind pulls… the clouds across the moon
…Your light fills the darkest room
And I can see the miracle… that keeps… us from
falling
She promised all the sweet-est gifts
That only… the heaven´s could bestow
You bring your light.. and shine.. like morning

Takes one second to breathe in and out

One heart beating echoes in a crowd

But much to their demise, poor decision closed their eyes

Trying to turn stone into bread
Masquerading like he got it figured out
Cut off from the sunshine, only smart in his own head
Leaving his descendants to     hope and doubt
Left to his devices, those worth the sacrifices
Praying to the alter of him self
Making pilgrimages, thinking he's religious
Like he's got all the light, and no one else
   He takes the unsuspected, Cuz he knows they're not connected
   And he shows them how to be just as he is
  Virtually real,     and commercially appealed
   To the lust of all the people where he lives
Eve was so naive, blinded by the pride and greed
Wanting to be intellectual
Drifting from the way she got turned down one day
And now she thinks that she's bisexual
  Caught up in emotion       Burning up in her devotion
To the king of exploitaion in the field
She handed him her virtue   Cuz he told her ""I won't hurt you""
So she lay with him to see how good it feels
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now
Now after the sensation, and the empty fornication
She brought affection home Into her bed
quickly multiplying Now the 3 of them are dieing
by the poison she perceived to be good head
Now Eve and her husband are perverted in their judgment
Cuz everything appears to be the same
They entertain suggestion
Next time just use protection
Desiring to cover up their shame
But much to their dem se, poor decision closed their eyes
To the very antidote to their dilemma
Burning in their lust      Both of them were dealt to us
Destroying the original agenda
Praying to the sky, in order to maintain a lie
They exhausted every possible conclusion
They can't even entertain the solution In a brain
filled with vain information and pollution
Hiding from the truth      He provided an excuse
to explain away his desperate situation
When confronted, blamed his wife Giving birth to carnal life
 Refusing to acknowledge what he done
Now if we can agree with who created us to be
Who says we're guilty everyone before his eyes
Making no exceptions, since the day of our conception
Predisposed to hating truth, and loving lies
Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now
Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now
Stop walking in pride, let the thief be crucified
Un learn everything you know, and let him teach you
Line upon line, every step upon precept,
say goodbye to this decaying social system
He wants to know, how far we're willing to go
If we love him like we say we do He will try us
Just don't regress     Or slip into hopelessness
Once he's satisfied his love     He won't deny us
And then he'll tell us what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now
And then he'll tell us what, What we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now

Limited to earth, unable to find out my worth
What a paradox, having God trapped in a box
All this time professing to be spiritual
Naturally pretending, that I'm actually defending
God through my façade, only material

Submit to truth, leave the deception of thy youth
Trust in the Lord, with all thy heart
And lean not to thine own understanding in all thy ways
Acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths
Be not wise in thine own eyes that you can’t follow him
We judge and condemn, just as ignorant as them
Oh so repressed, so convinced that I was blessed
When I played with my game of Monopoly
Oh to suggest, that my life is still a mess
To reveal the pride I'm hiding is what's stopping me
Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness
Abide in me and I in you, as the branch cannot bare
But without me, you can do nothing, oh Jerusalem
You're traditions have deceived you
I've chosen you, you haven't chosen me
And whatsoever, you ask in my name he may give to you
But in vain they call my name, teaching doctrines just the same
Just repent, turn from selfish motivation

Said it's the history of Inequity...
When it all...
All falls down...
Telling you all...
It all falls down
Children...
 Eat your bread
Little children...
  Eat your bread
Cause it all...
All falls down...
Telling you all...
It all falls down
Yo! Y'all can't handle the truth in a courtroom of lies
Perjures the jurors, witness despised
Crooked lawyers, false indictments publicized
It's entertainment, the arraignments, the subpoenas
High profile gladiators in bloodthirsty arenas
Enter the Dragon, black-robe crooked-balance
File it in the system not acknowledged by the Maker
Swearing by the bible blatantly blasphemous
Publicly perpetrating that ""In God We Trust""
Cross-examined by a master manipulator
The faster intimidator receiving the judge's favor
Deceiving sabers doing injury to their neighbors
For status, gratis, apparatus and legal waivers
The prosecution, political prostitution
The more money you pay, the further away solution
Legal actors, Babylon's benefactors
Masquerading as the agency for the clients
Hypocritical giants, morally non-compliant
Orally armed to do bodily harm
Polluted, recruited and suited judicial charm
And the defense isn't making any sense
Faking the confidence of escaping the consequence
That a defendant is depending on the system
Totally void of judgment purposely made to twist em'
Emotional victim blackmailed by the henchmen
Inventions whereby they lynch men
Enter the false witness slandering the accused
Planting the seed openly showing he's being used
Smearing the individual fearing the unsuspected
Expert witness (the paid authority)
Made a priority to deceive the majority
Hating the process, waiting to be returning to their careers
Do we expect the system made for the elect
To possibly judge correct? Properly serve and protect?
Materially corrupt, spiritually amuck
Oblivious to the cause, prosperously bankrupt
Blind leading the blind, guilty never defined
Legal extortion, blown out of proportion
In vein deceit, the truth is obsolete
Only two positions: victimizer or victim
Both end up in destruction trusting this crooked system
Skyscraping, paper chasing, what are we working for?
Empty traditions, reaching social positions
When the Son of Perdition is Commander in Chief
Woe to the men, trusted in the chariots dem'
Leaning on horses, they run their intellectual sources
Confusion consumes them
Every word they speak it turns them outwardly white
Trapped in the night and bonded to the Cain of the night
Under the curse, evil men waxing more worse
Faxing the first, angelic being cast to the earth
It's time for rebirth, burnin up the branch and the root
The empty pursuits of every tree bearing the wrong fruit
Turn and be healed, let him who stole, no longer steal
Oh it's real, surrender for Jehovah is real
The idols YOU heap, causing the destruction you reap
Abandon the flesh, self-interest: Broadway to death
Pride and the Greed, hide and subdividing the seed
The knowledge of Good and Evil is what caused us to lie
Renounce all your thoughts
You'll find what you sought
Was based on the deception you bought
A perception of naught where the majority remains caught
Loving a lie, not realizing in Adam, all die
Loving a lie, not realizing in Adam, all die
Loving a lie, not realizing in Adam, all die
Loving a lie, not realizing in Adam, all die
It's the mystery of iniquity...
Said it's the misery of Inequity...
Said it's the history of Inequity...

Telling you all...

Nature's got me high and it's beautiful
I'm with this deep eternal universe from death until rebirth
This corner of the earth is like me in many ways
I can sit for hours here and watch the emerald feathers play

I know this corner of the earth it smiles at me
So inspired that there's nothing left to do or say
Think I'll dream till the stars shine
The wind it whispers and the clouds don't seem to care
And I know inside that it's all mine

To a hazy afternoon in May

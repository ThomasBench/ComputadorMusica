Because we're only supposed to be friends
You see he stole my old lady away from me
And now I'm just as blue as I can be
I've got broken heart again
Because I ain't got no money to spend
You see I spend it all on long distance phone calls
Begging her to please come home, yeah, yeah
It doesn't matter what I do
  I can't stop, ah, thinking about you
   The little things you said
   The things you do to me in bed
   Oh baby, I can't get you out to my head
Oh, oh, got broken heart again, yeah
  This time it's serious, it feels just like the end
Because once your love has gone  away
There ain't nothing, nothing left to say

I'm gonna find my four leaf clover
Before my life is done
Some way, some how, I'm gonna have fun
Play in the sun   shine
We gonna love all our enemies
Till the gorilla falls off the wall
We're gonna rock him
We're gonna roll him
We're gonna teach him that love will make him tall (so tall)

When the big white rabbit begin to talk
And the color green will make your best friend leave ya
   It will make 'em do the walk
But that's cool
'Cause one day, everyday will be a yellow day

Just what you mean to me
   From the first moment I saw you
  That night I had to call you
I was rappin' til the sun came up
  Tellin' you just how fine you look
In a word, you were sex
All of my cool attitude you took
My body was next
You made love to me
Was you afraid of me?
Was I the first?
Was I your every fantasy?
  Until the end of time
  You own my heart and mind
I truly adore you
  If God one day struck me blind
   Love is too weak to define
Just what you mean to me

Tears of joy pourin' down on us
They know we need each other
They know you are my fix
I know, you know that I ain't cheatin baby
This ain't just for kicks, No
This condition I got is crucial
You could say that I'm a terminal case
You could burn up my clothes
Smash up my ride, well maybe not the ride
But I got to have your face
I'd like to think that I'm a man of exquisite taste
A hundred percent Italian silk, imported Egyptian lace
But nothin' baby, I said nothin' can compare
To your lovely face (do you know what I'm sayin' to you?)
I'm just tryin' to say
That until, until the end of time
I truly adore you
      You don't know what you mean to me
  Until the end of time
  You own my heart and mind
I truly adore you
  If God one day struck me blind
   Love is too weak to define
Just what you mean to me
           Can I talk to you?
Tell you what you mean to me
Everytime you wander
I'll be your eyes so you can see
   I  wanna show you things
That I never showed no other, I wanna be
  More than your mother
 More than your brother
 I wanna be like no other
(Loves too weak to define just what you mean to me)
If you need me, I'll never leave
I know, that you know, without you there is no me
There is no me
Without you there is no sea
Love is to weak to define how much I adore
You child you child
The last words you hear
The last words you hear

We said we needed space, but all we found was an empty place,
and the only things I learned is that I need you desperately.
So here I am and can you please tell me,    
Where do broken hearts go,  can they find their way home,
back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you,  won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes and I know that you still care for me.
I've been around enough to know that dreams don't turn to gold,
and that there is no easy way, no, you just can't run away.
And what we had was so much more than we ever had before,
and no matter how I try, you're always on my mind.
So here I am and can you please tell me,
Where do broken hearts go,  can they find their way home,
back to the open arms of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you,  won't they always love you?
I look in your eyes and I know that you still care for me.
And now that I am here with you, I'll never let you go,
I look into your eyes and now I know, now I know 
Where do broken hearts go,  can they find their way home,

Your laughter fills the air, once more I'm sensing de-feat
And I sup-pose you're leaving me now 
I was so sure now I'm so full of doubt
And I sup-pose you'll be leaving this place 
Just like the smile you wiped from my face, this time
I always gave my best, your memory serves you so badly
Some people kill for less, yet I'd still die for you gladly
But I sup-pose it's my turn now 
To play a scene that's familiar some-how
I turn the page and you walk away
Not even love could bring you to stay, this time
Walk a-way, it's so easy, once more I'm learning
In the depths of my despair, your lies con-firming, true love is so rare

And I su-ppose it's my turn now, there's no more love only feelings of doubt
Gone with the hope your words have erased, gone with the smile you wiped from my face
Love is a ship we all hope to steer, through troubled times cross an ocean of tears
A midnight sea that swells in your eyes, takes just one look to know I'm still mes-mer-ized
But I sup-pose you're leaving me now, I was so sure now I'm so full of doubt
I turn the page and you walk away, Not even love could bring you to stay, this time

  We got the time-----
Cause I got a man with a slow hand
I  got a lover with an easy touch
  I got somebody who will spend some ti-ime
Not come and go in a heated rush
I've found somebody who will understand
  When it comes to love, I want a slow hand
If I want it all night,  
please say it's all right
It's not a fast move,  but a slow groove
  On my mind----
Cause I got a man with a slow hand
I  got a lover with an easy touch
  I got somebody who will spend some ti-ime
Not come and go in a heated rush
I've found somebody who will understand
  When it comes to love, I want a slow hand

Bring your darkness to the light

My love I bring to you

For believing in me, I will make you mine
Side by side, for love we waited
Side by side, we're dedicated

Never going to know
What fate is going to blow
Your way just hope that it feels right
Sometimes it comes and it goes
You take it ever so slow
And then you lose it,
and then it flows right to you
So we rely on the past
And special moments that last
Were they as tender
As we dare to remember
Such a fine time as this
What could equal the bliss
The thrill of the first kiss
It'll blow right to you
It's never... as good as the first time...
It's never... as good as the first time...
Good times they come and they go
Never going to know
It's like the weather, one day
chicken next day feathers
The rose we remember
The thorns we forget
We'd love and leave
We never spend a minute on regret
It is a possibility
The more we know the less we see
Second time
is not quite what it seemed
Natural as the way
We came to be

42,Blue Light Boogie,Louis Jordan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/louis-jordan/blue-light-boogie-chords-2010877,"They did the boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
They did the boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
I went to a party
with bobby socks
at the party
I really got a shock
They did the boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
They did the boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
I started swingin'
all she did was rock
kept on swingin'
she said now, now listen pop
I like to boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
I like to boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
I looked around the shades were down
the chicks were in the groove
I didn't see how those cats could dance 
when they're feet didn't even move
I started swingin
swung my left foot ou
kept on swingin
I heard somebody shou
You gotta boogie real slow with the blue lights way down lo
You gotta boogie real slow with the blue lights way down lo
The house started rockin'
we really had a time
The house was rockin'
I nearly lost my mind
I couldn't boogie real slow with the blue light way down low
I couldn't boogie real slow with the blue light way down low
The folks kept on knockin'
They kept on comin' in
The folks was knockin'
'till it was half past ten
They did the boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
They did the boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
The girls and boys made so much noise
They even had a raid
The only thing those cops could find
Was ice cream and lemonade
Oh what a party
I should have stayed at home
Oh what a party
I was like a chaperone
I couldn't boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low
They did the boogie real slow with the blue lights way down low

Jalin dengan indah
Untuk menguraikan
Maksud hati
Kuberanikan diri
Untuk memulainya
Tapi mengapa bibirku
Tak dapat bergerak
Terasa berat
Oh malunya hati ini
Bila kuingat saat itu
Kami hanya saling berpandang
Dan terdiam terpaku
Oh bulan hanya dirimu
Yang menyaksikan segalanya
Oh bulan tolonglah daku
Katakan padanya
Ku cinta dia
Kata demi kata
Jalin dengan indah
Untuk menguraikan
Maksud hati
Kuberanikan diri

Tak dapat bergerak

Yang menyaksikan segalanya
Oh bulan tolonglah daku
Katakan padanya
Ku cinta dia
Kuberanikan diri
Untuk memulainya
Tapi mengapa bibirku
Terasa berat
Malam pun kian berlalu
Kami saling terpaku
Diam seribu bahasa
Hilang semua kata
Yang terangkaikan
Oh malunya hati ini
Bila kuingat saat itu
Kami hanya saling berpandang
Dan terdiam terpaku
Oh bulan hanya dirimu
Yang menyaksikan segalanya
Oh bulan tolonglah daku
Katakan padanya
Ku cinta dia

I tried to tell myself
But you can see it in my eyes
  So don't deny
I can't fool no one else
The truth is in the tears I cry         'Cause...
If it isn't love
Why do I feel this way
Why does she stay on my mind
If it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad
Make me feel so sad inside
If it isn't love
I told her I'd never fall in love,But now I know better
  How does it feel
I can't describe this feeling
That came when I saw her last night
  She got to me
I'll let you know the reason
I saw her with another guy,        So...
If it isn't love
Why do I feel this way
Why does she stay on my mind
If it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad
Make me feel so sad inside, and
If it isn't love
Why do I feel this way
Why does she stay on my mind
If it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad
Make me feel so sad inside
If it isn't love
Maybe she'll take me back
(Hey, girl, he's begging)
I made a big mistake
(Won't you forgive him, girl)
Now I can feel it
(He's never felt before)
I really love her
(You love her, What?!?!)
  It took my heart
To shatter in a thousand pieces
Before I'd ever drop my pride,  (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
  Losing love worrying about my image
Really helped me realize
If it isn't love
Why do I feel this way
Why does she stay on my mind
If it isn't love
Why does it hurt so bad
Make me feel so sad inside, and

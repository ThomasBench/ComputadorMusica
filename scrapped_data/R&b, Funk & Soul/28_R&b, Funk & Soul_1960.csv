I've tried to put my arms around you,
All because I wanted, to hold you tight.
But every time I reach for you, baby,
And try to kiss you, you just jump clean out of sight.
Oh, I've got news for you; baby, that I've made plans for two.
I guess I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow;
Got my mind made up to love you.

I'm gonna love you, (gonna love you in every way),
In every way, (gonna love you in every way).

With other girls I've wanted, I've dated just a moment,
With you, I shall remain, (I'll stay by your side).
Now I know you've heard about me; bad things about me, baby,
 Please let me explain, (don't you listen to that jive).

Because she's the sweetest thing in this whole world
Oh, whenever I'm feeling bad
Right away she puts me to bed
And she hires two nurses, one to hold my hand
The other one to rub my head
Oh, whenever I tell her, ""Honey I'm hungry""
Now go and fix me something to eat
This girl rushes in the kitchen and fixes me a dinner
With seven different kinds of meat
If I call her up at two o'clock in the morning
And say, ""Come on over if you can""
Before I hang up the telephone, she's sitting beside me
With a cup of coffee in her hand

And life is like a song.

The night I looked at you.

A dream that I       can call my own,
I found a thrill to press my cheek to,
A thrill I       have never known.
You smiled          and then the spell was cast,
And here we are in heaven,
For you are mine at last.

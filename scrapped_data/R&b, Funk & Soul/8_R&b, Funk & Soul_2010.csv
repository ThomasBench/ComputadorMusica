0,Wake Up (ver 2),EDEN (The Eden Project),https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/eden-the-eden-project/wake-up-chords-1770360," Cause we've been driving so long
 I can't remember how we got here
 Or how we survived so long
 'Till you set fire to my atmosphere
 And I remember how I spent the 23rd
 When I'm thirty thousand feet in the air
 Chasing that sundown
 Feeling like the edge of this world is near
 But you'll feel better when you wake up
 Everything or more when I get back someday
 This is more than just a phase, love
 And even though it seems like half the world away
 Things will be better in America
 Maybe I could fly you out this place someday
 Chasing dreams like I'm on Novocain
 Looking back I almost thought I heard you say
 Stay, you're not gonna leave me
 This place is right where you need to be
 And why your words gotta mean so much to them
 So stay, you're not what you're hearing
 'Cause I've been watching you changing
 And who said you're one in a million
 Cause you see only what you want to
 Your tunnel vision haunts you
 When you keep sleeping through the PM
 You’re sleepwalking, just keep talking
 And maybe you can talk your way out of this deep end
 Just tell me what you're thinking
 I'm scared that you might fall
 But you're not
 And you'll feel better when you wake up
 Sun always seems to wash our fears away
 And it's always shining somewhere
 And even though it seems like half the world away
 Things are better in America
 Maybe I could fly you out this place someday
 Chasing dreams like I'm on Novocain
 Looking back I almost thought I heard you say
 Stay, you're not gonna leave me
 This place is right where you need to be
 And why your words gotta mean so much to them
 So stay, you're not what you're hearing
 Cause I've been watching you changing
 And who said you're one in a million
 You’re so much better than that
 You’re so much better than that
 You’re so much better than that
 Stay, you're not what you're hearing
 Cause I've been watching you changing
 And who said you're one in a million anyway?
 And you'll feel better when you wake up
 Everything or more when I get back someday
 Chasing dreams like I'm on Novocain
 Looking back I almost thought I heard you say

It's been a few years since I've felt sure of what I want

Woah, old friend it's bittersweet
How could you do this to me?
How could you do this to me?
'Cos you are not who you think you are
There's no grain on these brown eyes, but they can be green if they really want
And I can bend your words so they say exactly what hurts the most
But silence is better than fake laughs or faking were always up, loose grip
The world bends around you
And living through cracked screens
We fall fold down to what we want
Out of love, we talk through lines, we're made of smoke
And just in time, we drift away
Diffusing light, confusing times
Growing up, or cascading down?
Cascading down
I'm hurting now
But change comes slow
If you hate what's in your head, the fuck would you speak your mind?
In search of lost time
Just 21 so I'm young and I'm stupid
Only 16, yeah I think you should've known
I think you fucked me up
I think,
I think you fucked me up
And I've got nothing to say to you

Bout a fertile land in a roll of lush waters

They don't want the brown alliance, they'd rather get our secrets
And little bully, mistreat us. Take our color and our culture

Will I catch up to love, I could never tell, I know
Chasing after you is like a fairytale, but I
Feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
Come, come one, come all, you must be this tall
To ride this ride at the carnival
Oh, come take my hand, and run through playland
So high, too high at the carnival
And it’s all fun and games, 'til somebody falls in love
But you've already bought a ticket, and there’s no turning back now
Round and round like a horse on a carousel, we go
Will I catch up to love, I could never tell, I know
Chasing after you is like a fairytale, but I
Feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
This horse is too slow, we’re always this close
Almost, almost, we’re a freakshow
Right, right when I’m near, it’s like you disappear
Where’d you go, is that Houdini or a freakshow
And it’s all fun and games, 'til somebody falls in love
But you've already bought a ticket, and there’s no turning back now
Round and round like a horse on a carousel, we go
Will I catch up to love, I could never tell, I know
Chasing after you is like a fairytale, but I
Feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
Why did you steal my cotton candy heart
You threw it in this damn coin slot
And now I’m stuck, I'm stuck
Riding, riding, riding
Round and round like a horse on a carousel, we go
Will I catch up to love, I could never tell, I know
Chasing after you is like a fairytale, but I
Feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel

Though only in the hope that one day I would undress her
Don't be offended
You think I'm 'bout to tell you that ""I love you""
But I really really really fucking don't
See the months of obsession
And crying for hours
I even started sitting down in the shower, girl
I'll take my time on my own
And I'll be fine now I'm alone
Constantly told stories with a stretch of the truth
Trying hard to make memories to re - member from youth
Desperately wanting you to be interested too
It's not clear what I need yet
But it's clear it's not you
Here's what I'd say to any young man that's still interested in you
 Do you prioritise the things in your life
The things that you hope to do
Mate you'd better trust me when I tell you that
It's not worth forgetting about yourself
She may seem perfect, and gorgeous, and lovely
You'll think she likes you
I mean I thought she loved me, no
But no
Neither of us will get down from the shelf
The only one she loves is herself

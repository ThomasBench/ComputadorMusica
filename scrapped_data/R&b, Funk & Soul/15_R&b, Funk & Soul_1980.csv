0,Nobody Loves Me Like You Do,Whitney Houston,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/whitney-houston/nobody-loves-me-like-you-do-chords-4113331,"Like a candle burning bright
Love is glowing in your eyes
A flame to light our way
That burns brighter everyday
Now I have         you
And nobody loves me  like you do
Like a leaf up on the wind
I could find no place to land
I'd dreamed the hours away
And wondered every day
Do dreams come      true?
Nobody loves me  like you do
What if I'd never met you?
Where would I be right now?
Funny how life just falls in place somehow
You touched my heart in places
That I never even knew
Nobody loves me like you do
 I was words without a tune
 I was a song still unsung
A poem with no rhyme
A dancer out of time
But now there's  you
Nobody loves me   like you do
What if I'd never met you?
Where would I be right now?
Funny how life just falls in place somehow
You touched my heart in places
That I never even knew
Nobody loves me (nobody loves me)
Nobody loves me (nobody loves me)
Nobody loves me like you do
Nobody loves me like you do

1,One Moment In Time (ver 3),Whitney Houston,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/whitney-houston/one-moment-in-time-chords-1957491,"Each day I live, I want to be, a day to give, the best of me,
I'm only one, but not a – lone, my finest day, is yet unknown.
I broke my heart, for every gain, to taste the sweet, I faced the pain,
I rise and fa…ll, yet through it all, this must remain......
I want one, moment in time, when I'm more than I thought I could be.
When all of my dreams, are a heart beat away, 
And the answers are all up to me.
Give me one, moment in time, when I'm racing with des – ti - ny,
Then, in that one moment of time,
I will feel, I will feel, e – tern-i-ty.
I've lived to be, the very best, I want it all, no time for less
I've laid the plans, now lay the chance, here in my hands......
Give me one, moment in time, when I'm more than I thought I could be
When all, of my dreams, are a heart beat away, 
And the answers are all up to me.
Give me one moment in time, when I'm racing with des – ti - ny,
Then, in that one moment of time,
I will feel, I will feel, e – tern - i - ty,  Oh.o.o
You're a win-ner for a lifetime, if you seize that, 
One moment in time, make it shine, 
Give, me, one, moment in time, when I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heart beat away, 
And the answers are all up to me.
Gi-ive me one mo-ment in time, when I'm racing with des-tin-y
Then, in that one moment of time
I  will be, I  will be, I will be free
I will be, I-will-be free

 This love is strong why do I feel weak

But there's something on my mind,
You see, I haven't been the same,
Since that cold November day.
We said we needed space,
But all we found was an empty place.
And the only things I learned,
Is that I need you desperately.
So here I am,
And can you please tell me, oh.
Where do broken hearts go,
    Can they find their way home,
     Back to the open arms,
Of a love that's waiting there?
And if somebody loves you,
    Won't they always love you?
     I look in your eyes,
And I know that you still care    for me.
I've been around enough to know,
That dreams don't turn to gold,
And that there is no easy way,
No, you just can't run away.
And what we had was so much more,
Than we ever had before,
And no matter now I try,
You're always on my mind.
So here I am,
And can you please tell me, oh.
Where do broken hearts go,
    Can they find their way home,
     Back to the open arms,

And if somebody loves you,
    Won't they always love you?

I'll never let you go.

4,Didnt We Almost Have It All (ver 2),Whitney Houston,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/whitney-houston/didnt-we-almost-have-it-all-chords-3097322,"  Remember when we held on in the rain
The nights we almost lost it
Once again, we can take the night  in- to  tomorrow
Living on feelings
Touching you I feel it all again
 Didn't we almost have it all
   When love was all we had worth giving?
 The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
   Loving you makes life worth living
  Didn't we almost have it all?
   The nights we held on till the morning
  You know you'll never love that way again
   Didn't we almost have it all?
  The way you used to touch me felt so fine
We kept our hearts together    down the line
A moment in the soul can  last forever
Comfort and keep us
Help me bring the feeling back again
 Didn't we almost have it all
   When love was all we had worth giving?
 The ride with you was worth the fall my friend
   Loving you makes life worth living
  Didn't we almost have it all?
   The nights we held on till the morning
  You know you'll never love that way again
   Didn't we almost have it all?
Didn't we have the best of times
When love was young and new?
Couldn't we reach inside and find
That world of  me  and you?
We'll never lose it again
'Cause once you know what love is
You'll never let it end
  Didn't we almost have it all
   When love was all we had worth giving?
  The ride with  you was worth the fall my friend
   Loving you makes life worth living
  Didn't we almost have it all?
   The nights we held on till the morning
  You know you'll never love that way again
   Didn't we almost have it all?

People saying that you're no good for me,
""Saw your lover with another and she's making a fool of you"" Whoa
If you loved me baby you'd deny it,
But you laugh and tell me I should try it,
Tell me I'm a baby, and I don't understand.
But you know that I'll forgive you,
Just this once, twice, forever,
'Cause baby, you could drag me to hell and back,
Just as long as we're together. And you do
I don't want your freedom,
I don't want to play around,
I don't want nobody baby,
Part time love just brings me down.
I don't want your freedom,
Girl, all I want right now is you.
Like a prisoner who has his own key
But I can't escape until you love me
I just go from day to day knowing all about the other boys
You take my hand and tell me I'm a fool to
give you all that I do
I bet you someday baby someone says the same to you
Just this once twice forever
'cause baby, you could drag me to hell and back

You take it ever so slow

And special moments that last
Were they as tender
As we dare to remember
Such a fine time as this
What could equal the bliss
The thrill of the first kiss
It'll blow right to you

The thorns we forget

All across the world there's people high on confronta-tion
And they try to solve their problems burning up the na-tion

But still we get no answers using yesterday's solu-tions

Dance on heavy weather, raise the heartbeat of the young
If we move together, don't you know that we are the ones

Say you want to live your life in private isolation
From the east you can't ignore the storm of disillusion
And so it falls on all our shoulders to find a new solution

Dance on heavy weather, learn to live with modern times
You can take the pressure, it's all a state of mind - so we can
Dance on heavy weather, raise the heartbeat of the young
If we move together, let the soul - take control - we are the ones
Take a chance - and dance, It's a chance - dance, Take a chance - and dance, It's a chance - dance
Take a chance - and dance, It's a chance - dance, Take a chance - and dance, It's a chance - dance
Take a chance - and dance, It's a chance - dance, Take a chance - and dance, It's a chance - dance
Take a chance - and dance, It's a chance - dance, Take a chance - and dance, It's a chance - dance
Take a chance - and dance, It's a chance - dance, Take a chance - and dance, It's a chance - dance
Take a chance - and dance, It's a chance - dance, Take a chance - and dance, It's a chance - dance
Dance on heavy weather, hear the sound of the heartbeat of the young
We can take the pressure, we may have a solution, we are the ones
Dance on heavy weather, hear the sound of the heartbeat of the young
If we move together, We may have a solution, we are the ones (Repeat and Fade)

Don't you re-member, How you eased my disgrace, Don't you re-member, The love you saw in my face
Perfected in si-lence, A physical presence, Perfected in si-lence, A physical presence
I sought af-fection, But now I rea-lize, A cold re-jection, The movement in your eyes
But I can remember, When you shook a-gainst me, I can re-member, When I saw what love could be
Perfected in si-lence, A physical presence, Perfected in si-lence, A physical presence
How How How
Part of the answer, Is that there's really no escape 
Part of the answer, Is that life can have such perfect shape
Don't you remember, All the nights you shared in my disgrace, Don't you re-member
That the love that filled this empty space was, perfected in si-lence
A physical presence, Perfected in si-lence, A physical presence
Perfected in si-lence, A physical presence, Perfected in si-lence, A physical presence
How How How

38,Standing In The Light,Level 42,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/level-42/standing-in-the-light-chords-3180218,"A summer's day in sixty-eight, sunlight through a window falls a-cross the page
A young boy tries to concentrate, his mind would rather fly beyond the classroom cage
He can take the teacher's voice, turn it into music from a-nother place
All the other kids don't have that choice, hanging on to every word the teacher says
Day and night - we will be touched, Standing in the light - don't sha-dow the genius
So out of school he walks alone, soon his thoughts are flowing like a golden stream
An empty house he calls his own, this place becomes a temple to a silent dream
Sometimes he will clap and sing, then deep in medi-tation he will learn to be
And only birds upon the wing, with upward fasci-nation claim to be so free
Day and night - we will be touched, Standing in the light - don't sha-dow the genius
     Your smile,    your freedom,    comes to you from within
     Still a child     with a reason,     you're af-raid but it's time to begin
     Blow the wind of  change, though the words are strange -    to hear
     Say what's on your mind, now is not the time - for fear
A summer's day in eight-one, sunlight through a window falls a-cross the page
A young man's fight has just begun, and rising up in-side him is a burning rage
They called his dream a fantasy, a song that every child has sung since time began
But just as long as he believes, standing in the light he'll make them understand                       (Fade)

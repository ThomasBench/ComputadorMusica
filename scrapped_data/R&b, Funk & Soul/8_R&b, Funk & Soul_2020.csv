Why save the good champagne forever
You gotta pull it out and open it up, yeah
'Cause the best things in life get better
When you share it with the ones you love
So, let's put our love on display
Oh, I want everyone to know
That I got you, you got me
And we won't ever let it go
Let's show 'em all what we've found
Pile on that PDA
Wanna take you all over town
And put our love on display
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
I want everyone to know, know, know
You wouldn't go and wear a hat with a fresh cut
Or buy a front-row seat and not sing loud
You wouldn't throw a big party on your birthday
Nah, just to shut it down early
Oh, what's it all for
If we keep it to ourselves
Don't show anybody else now
Oh, don't hide it no more
We should be up on the top shelf
Let's put our love on display
Oh, I want everyone to know (I wanna know)

Something 'bout this place never did feel right to me

42,Oh Mexico,Jeremy Zucker,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jeremy-zucker/oh-mexico-chords-2779237,"No, I don't miss you yet
You're just a feeling I'd rather forget
So I pierce my skin and I buzz my hair
I'm going to Mexico
No, I don't feel the same
The lack of chemicals in my brain
Won't keep me warm
So I pause and pray
I don't wanna feel the cold
So I'm going to Mexico
Oh,   Mexico
Sounds so sweet
But I'm going there alone
I tried to be myself but still
I've got some room to grow
   I'm going to Mexico
And I won't miss you then
The weight of every word on my chest
So I curse my name
And my fragile frame
Anywhere could feel like home (Anywhere)
But I'm going to Mexico
Oh,   Mexico
Sounds so sweet
But I'm going there alone
I tried to be myself but still
I've got some room to grow
  I'm going to Mexico
     (Mexico)
     (Mexico)
     (Mexico)
  I'm going to Mexico

43,I Dont Think I Can Do This Again,Mura Masa,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/mura-masa/i-dont-think-i-can-do-this-again-chords-2805677,"Remember when we used to fight?
I'd stay up all night
Trying to put it behind me
      But was it really that long ago?
Realized that I should let it go
Don't even know the time and place
Call me when you get a second
Know it's been a minute since I've picked you up
We drove around so I opened the windows down
Don't ask any questions
Only been here for three seconds
The party's ending, where's your friend?
But I don't think I can do this again
I don't think I can do this again
I don't think I can do this again
But I don't think I can do this again
The grass is always green, but why did it use to feel
So much softer, longer, sweeter, cleaner than this?
And I'm all in my head now
Don't you see what you've done now?
Missing all the things I wouldn't have loved
Call me when you get a second
Know it's been a while since we've talked it out
We're missing out
So young and we're so full of doubt
And I've been thinking of you in my room
Do you remember it too?
Remember it too?
     Remember it too?
I don't think I can do this again
I don't think I can do this again
I don't think I can do this again
    (do this again, remember it too)
And I don't think I can do this again
And I've been thinking of you in my room
Do you remember it too?
Remember it too?

And every time you touch me I shiver right down to my toes
You've got a strange effect on me
You know you make me feel so
Glittery
You light me up like starlight on a Christmas tree
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart
Outside it's coming down but here inside, it's warming up so
And when you take your time you turn me on and make my life glow
You've got a strange effect on me
You make me feel so
Glittery
You light me up like starlight on a Christmas tree
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart
Winter is so gray, it's like the ice is here to stay
But when you look at me, you know you melt it all away
Every single kiss is like a gift to me
And I love the way you decorate my heart
Oh, so glittery
And I love the way you decorate my heart

Looking for a way out
I can feel it happening
So I talk myself down
'Cause right now
 The walls are starting to cave in
 Sometimes, I wish I was somebody else
 When my mind starts misbehaving
 Is when I tell myself
Okay, baby, you'll be okay
You just gotta keep, gotta keep on
 Rolling even on the bad days
You just gotta keep, gotta keep on
Every time I run away
It catches up somehow
But I've been learning what to say
So I talk myself down
'Cause right now
 The walls are starting to cave in
 Sometimes, I wish I was somebody else
 When my mind starts misbehaving
 Is when I tell myself
Okay, baby, you'll be okay
You just gotta keep, gotta keep on
 Rolling even on the bad days
You just gotta keep, gotta keep on
You just gotta keep on breathing
Even when your lungs have run out of air
Okay, baby, you'll be okay
You just gotta keep, gotta keep on
You just gotta keep on (Just gotta keep on)
Keep, gotta keep on, you just gotta keep on (Just gotta keep on)
Keep, gotta keep on, you just gotta keep on
 The walls are starting to cave in
 Sometimes, I wish I was somebody else
 When my mind starts misbehaving

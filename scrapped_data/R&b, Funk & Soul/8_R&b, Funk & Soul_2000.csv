  For I have walked the sinful road
  That I'm down on my knees
Lord have mercy on me, please
  Jesus, I must confess
  That in all my loneliness
I've forsaken and I've sinned
Leaving fragments of a man so broken
I could tell you what I've done
Or should I tell you where I went wrong?
Well the more that I start to play
My deceitful, evil ways
Keep on growing stronger by the day
Oh lord have mercy on my soul
For I have walked a sinful road
So I'm gonna get down on my knees
Beg forgiveness to help set me free
Lord have mercy on me, please
Mother Mary full of grace
In my weakness, I've lost faith
I've been careless, and I have been warned
And the devil inside me is torn
God bless the men that I have scorned
Oh lord have mercy on my soul
For I have walked a sinful road
So I'm gonna get down on my knees
Beg forgiveness to help set me free
Lord have mercy on me, please
So don't let me fool around no more
Send your angels down to guide me through that door
Well I've gone and confessed my regrets
And I pray I'm not held in contempt
I'm so lost, and I need you to help me repent
Oh lord have mercy on my soul
Oh I'm begging, I'm pleeding, I'm needing
So I'm down upon my knees
Oh lord, 
I need forgiveness from you

1,Lesson Learned,Alicia Keys,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/alicia-keys/lesson-learned-chords-613525,"  He broke    my heart
  and now it's raining
   I'm at   your door
  I feel so crazy bout' it
  You say I told you so
  You saw it long ago
  You knew he had to go
  I finally came around
  I'm back on solid ground
  Can't let it get me down

Yes I was burned but I called it a lesson learned.
Mistake overturned so I called it a lesson learned.
My soul has returned so I call it a lesson learned.
Another lesson Learned
  Sometimes    some lies  
  can take a minute
    to fully realize
  His tears    your eyes
  30 seconds    to apologize
  You give him one more chance
   just like the time before
   but he already knows    you'd give a hundred more
   until that night in bed,   you wake up in a sweat
   Your racing to the door
   Can't take it anymore
   I was burned but I called it a lesson learned.
Mistake overturned so I called it a lesson learned.
My soul has returned so I call it a lesson learned.
(Another lesson Learned)
   Life perfect, aint perfect if you don't know what the struggles for
  Falling down aint falling down if you don't cry when you hit the floor
  It's called the past 'cause im getting past 
and I ain't nothing like I was before.
You ought to see me now.

Didn't know I'd meet
Such a beautiful girl
Walking down the street
Seen those bright brown eyes
With tears coming down
She deserves a crown
But where is it now

He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love
Running fast in my mind
Girl don't you slow it down
If we carry on this way
This thing might leave the ground
How would you like to fly? (silence)
That's how my queen should ride
But you still deserve the crown

I see something that money can't buy
And I know if you give us a try
I'll work hard for you girl
And no longer will you ever have to cry

你没有舍不得
你说你也会难过我不相信
牵着你陪着我 也只是曾经
希望他是真的比我还要爱你
我才会逼自己离开
你要我说多难堪
我根本不想分开
为什么还要我用微笑来带过
我没有这种天份
包容你也接受他
不用担心的太多
我会一直好好过
你已经远远离开
我也会慢慢走开
为什么我连分开都迁就着你
我真的没有天份
安静的没这么快
我会学着放弃你
是因为我太爱你

Searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that one
Really loves my company
He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
But clouds are rollin' in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy
With some other guy
   I don't wanna do this anymore
   I don't wanna be the reason why
Everytime I walk out the door
 I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
   I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be...
a murderer
I feel it in the air
As I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Accepts i'm gonna be out late
I say I won't belong
Just hangin' with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy
With some other guy                
   I don't wanna do this anymore
   I don't wanna be the reason why
Everytime I walk out the door

I don't wanna hurt him anymore

 I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with I don't wanna do this

We'd go to the club, and not see any-one.
Without girls like you, there's no night life,
All those men just go home to their wi-ives.

You say I've known you longer, my dear
You like to be so close, I like to be alone
I like to sit on chairs and you prefer the floor
Walking with each other
But we do, but we do do do do, but we do, but we do do do do do do do do

You're the first to make up whenever we argue
I don't know who I'd be if I didn't know you

You're so adventurous, I'm so very cautious, combining

Take me on a cruise around the world, baby you know I'm worth it 
Dinner lit by candles, run my bubble bath
Make love tenderly to last and last, baby you know I'm worth it 
Wanna please, wanna keep, wanna treat your woman right 
Not just told but to show that you know she is worth your time 
You will lose if you choose to refuse to put her first 
She will if she can't find a man who knows her worth
Mmmm mmmm (3x) // mmm
Cuz a real man knows a real woman when he sees her 
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her 
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first 
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth 
If you treat me fairly, I'll give you all my goods 
Treat you like a real woman should, baby I know you're worth it 
If you never play me, promise not to bluff 
I'll hold you down when shit gets rough, baby I know you're worth it 
She'll walk the mile, make you smile, all the while being true 
Don't take for granted the passion that she has for you 
You will lose if you choose to refuse to put her first 
She will if she can't find a man who knows her worth ohhhh
No need to read between the lines, spell it out for you 
Just hear this song cuz you can't go wrong when you value

 Oh, what a mess we made
 And now the final frame,
 Love is a losing game

 Love is a losing hand
 Self professed,
 Profound,
 Till the chips were down
 Know you’re a gambling man,
 Love is a losing hand

 Love is a fate resigned
 Memories mar my mind,
 Love is a fate resigned
 Over futile odds,
 And laughed at by the gods
 And now the final frame,

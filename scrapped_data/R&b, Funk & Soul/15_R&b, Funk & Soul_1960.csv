0,A Warm Little Home On A Hill,Stevie Wonder,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/stevie-wonder/a-warm-little-home-on-a-hill-chords-2538975,"There's a warm little home on a hill
And the presents that's hiding somewhere
And the world is so peaceful and still
You can almost hear love in the air
There's a blanket of snow on the ground
And a bright little star in the sky
And your heart knows that Santa is around
By the twinkle in everyone's eye
There's gift bringing and bells ringing
And warm little feet by the fire
There are kids playing and folks praying
And somewhere the sound of a choir
There's two people who never will part
And two stockings we still have to fill
There's a warm little place in my heart
For our warm little home on the hill
There's gift bringing and bells ringing
And warm little feet by the fire
There are kids playing and folks praying
And somewhere the sound of a choir
There's two people who never will part
And two stockings we still have to fill
There's a warm little place in my heart
For our warm little home on the hill

Lots of snow and ice
Everywhere we go
Choirs singin' carols
Right outside my door
All these things and more

That's what Christmas means to me my love
(That's what Christmas means to me my love)
I see your smilin' face
Like I never seen before
Even though I love ya madly
It seems I love you more
The little cards you give me
Will touch my heart for sure
All these things and more, darling
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas means to me my love
(That's what Christmas means to me my love)
 I feel like runnin' wild
 As anxious as a little child
Greet you 'neath the mistletoe
Kiss you once and then some more
And wish you a Merry Christmas baby
(Wish you a Merry Christmas baby)
And such happiness in the comin' year
(Happiness in the comin' year)
Let's deck the halls with holly
Sing sweet silent night
Fill the tree with angel hair
And pretty, pretty lights
Go to sleep and wake up
Just before daylight
All these things and more, baby

That's what Christmas means to me my love

Well I hope that you can just let it go by.
And if I, if I have been untrue
Well I hope you know it was never to you.

Like a beast with his horn
I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song
And by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch,
Well he said to me, ""You must not ask for so much.""

She said to me, ""why not ask for more?""

Upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd of red eyed cows he saw
Came rushing through the ragged sky and up the cloudy draw
Yippie yi yaaaaay
Yippie yi Ohhhhh
Ghost Riders in the sky
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky
he saw the Riders coming hard and he heard their mournful cry
Yippie yi yaaaaay
Yippie yi Ohhhhh
Ghost Riders in the sky
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred, their shirts all soaked with sweat
He's riding hard to catch that herd, but he ain't caught 'em yet
'Cause they've got to ride forever on that range up in the sky
On horses snorting fire
As they ride on hear their cry
Yippie yi yaaaaay
Yippie yi Ohhhhh
Ghost Riders in the sky
As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from Hell a-riding on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the Devil's herd, across these endless skies

smiling at men who are never impressed,

Ride Louise, ride (yeah) let me be your guide
I'll take you any place you wanna go, (yes I will)
Ride Louise, ride (yeah) let me be your guide
and I'll show you all the things you want to know (if I can)
Living her life at a speed all her own,
talking to people wherever she goes,
always working hard she won't disagree,

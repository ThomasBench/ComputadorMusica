0,What You Dont Do (ver 3),Lianne La Havas,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lianne-la-havas/what-you-dont-do-chords-3092465,"  Heavy words, little lies
  Telling everything but the truth,      the truth
  Three little words over time
  Overheard and overused,   used
No sweet nothing could ever be turned into something new
No grand gesture could ever be made to measure you
I know what I got and I know where we're going
You don't need to show it, I already know it all
It's what you don't do,
 (It's what you don't do)
I know you love me, I don't need proof
It's what you don't do,
the games you don't play
 (It's what you don't do)
I know you love me, I don't need proof
  I've been saving up my time
  so I could spend it all on you,   on you
  Oh, all I need is to see you smile;
  I've forgotten how to be blue,    blue
I know what I got and I know where we're going
You don't need to show it, I already know it all
It's what you don't do,
 (It's what you don't do)
I know you love me, I don't need proof
It's what you don't do,
the games you don't play
 (It's what you don't do)
I know you love me, I don't need proof
  Don't tell the whole world,
  just wanna be your girl
 (It's what you don't do,  It's what you don't do)
The closer we get, oh-oh
The less we need to show
I know what I got and I know where we're going
You don't need to show it, I already know it all
It's what you don't do,
 (It's what you don't do)
I know you love me, I don't need proof
It's what you don't do,
the games you don't play
 (It's what you don't do)
I know you love me, I don't need proof
  Don't tell the whole world,
  just wanna be your girl
 (It's what you don't do)
I know you love me, I don't need proof
It's what you don't do,
 (It's what you don't do,  It's what you don't do)
The closer we get, oh-oh
The less we need to show

time to let them breathe

32,Chill In The Air,Amos Lee,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/amos-lee/chill-in-the-air-chords-1453777," Well, the morning came like a freight train
 Bearing down on me from a thousand miles of rail
 Well it came and gone And kept rolling on
 Laying up all night with my tear-stained sheet as my veil
 I don't want to see you again
 I don't want to feel your breath 
 As you leaned on me so peacefully while we slept 
 And I don't want the keys to our door; I don't live there anymore
 And I'll do my best just to forget the dreams we've dreamt
 Well, the morning came with the pouring rain
 And I felt just as empty as a pail
 With the evidence and your crime confessed 
 Don't seem right that it’s me that spent a night in jail
 I don't want to see you again
 I don't want to feel your breath
 As you leaned on me so peacefully while we slept
 And I don't want the keys to our door; I don't live there anymore
 And I'll do my best just to forget the dreams we've dreamt
 If you feel a chill in the air
 It’s my spirit hanging somewhere
 If you ever get scared
 Look on the Brightside 
 You got a new life
 Now the evenings come and I'm all alone
 And I can't tell if silence is my foe or my friend
 Well I'm holding on but I ain't too strong
 I gotta get some rest before that train come back round the bend
 I don't want to see you again
 I don't want to feel your breath 
 As you leaned on me so peacefully while we slept
 And I don't want the keys to our door; I don't live there anymore
 And I'll do my best just to forget the dreams we've dreamt

36,Break The Shell,India.Arie,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/india-arie/break-the-shell-chords-1462402,"    I met a prophet dark as the night
She could see into my soul
Said she'd been watching and had some advice
She said shadows make you whole
A life without pain is a wolf in sheep's clothes
Cause if you listen to the lessons that it holds
You'll find the gold
Child it's time to break the shell
Life's gonna hurt but it's meant to be felt
You cannot touch the sky from inside yourself
You cannot fly until you break the shell
   I can remember when I was a child
How the grown folks seemed so crazy
Why are they so angry, why are they so loud ?
And when I grow up that's never ever gonna be me
That was the moment that I decide
That I would build a wall just shy of six feet tall
Too strong to fall
Child it's time to break the shell
Life's gonna hurt but it's meant to be felt
You cannot touch the sky from inside yourself
You cannot fly until you break the shell
   Courage is not being hard
It's time to peel back all of the layers
You put between who you're meant to be
And who you are
And go be who you are
   So much disappointment to finally understand
That there is no such thing as perfect
Were all simply doing the best that we can
And we have a choice to live or truly be alive
This is your life
Child it's time to break the shell
Life's gonna hurt but it's meant to be felt
You cannot touch the sky from inside yourself
You cannot fly until you break the shell
Child it's time to break the shell
Life's gonna hurt but it's meant to be felt
You cannot touch the sky from inside yourself
A bird cannot fly until it breaks the shell
Do with these words what you will
It's time for us to be for real
You'll be stuck on the ground until
You finally break the shell

It seemed to make a lot more sense
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us, yeah.
I'm ready to make that turn
Before we both crash and burn
Cause that could be the death of us, the death of us, baby
You know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Going the wrong way home
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper traffic,
Cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue

Baby, coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?
 Hey, what happened to the butterflies?
Guess they encountered that stop sign
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light
 Hey, right when I think that we found it,
Well, that's when we start turning around
But we're still going the wrong way, baby

Well, they must've been talking about us
and sometimes I feel like I've been here before
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right
We gon' be lost if we continue to fight
Honey I know, yeah,
We can find our way home

Round and round again
Looking for a life beyond the end

Round and round again

Yes, I'm to blame
Oh, I took the blame
Turned it into this serenade
Oh, the mess I've made
       And I should have warned you
What was in store
But I was so so sure
I wasn't haunted anymore
Not forevermore

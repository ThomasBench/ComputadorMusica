Or so it seems
How I met this girl
Was like a dream
It was late one night
She was a beautiful sight
Standin' thin and tall
Her dress mostly nothin' at all
She's bad   I  know
I'm glad     wow
She's more than I ever had... more than I ever had
She dance so close to me
Moves so differently
Could it be love... it's a funky situation
Could it be love... it's beyond my imagination
Could it be love... she's such a sweet temptation
Could it be love
It's funky... it's funky... it's funky
It's a funky situation
It's funky... it's funky... it's funky
It's a funky situation
She goes for me
She sets my soul on fire
Every day and night
I have such desire
To hold her close to me
To touch her tenderly
Oh... it's so thrilling
To know she's willing... yeah
Makes me scream
She's a love machine
Oww... I just can't describe
This feelin' that I have inside
Could it be love... it's a funky situation
Could it be love... it's beyond my imagination
Could it be love... she's such a sweet temptation
Could it be love
It's funky... it's funky... it's funky
It's a funky situation
It's funky... it's funky... it's funky
It's a funky situation
It's funky... it's funky... it's funky
It's a funky situation
It's funky... it's funky... it's funky

1,Summer Soft (ver 3),Stevie Wonder,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/stevie-wonder/summer-soft-chords-3998659," Summer soft, wakes you with a kiss, to start the morning off.
 In the midst of herself playing Santa Claus,
She brings gifts... through her breeze.
 Morning rain, gently plays her rhythms on your window pane.
 Giving you no clue of when she plans to change,
To bring rain, or sun-shine.
And so you wait to see what she'll do;
Is it sun or rain for you?
But it breaks your heart in two
when you find it's  Oc   -to -ber...
And she's gone,
And she's gone.
Summer's gone
taking with  her   summer's play...
Winter wind, whispers to you that he wants to be your friend
But not waiting for your answer, he begins,
Forcing dangers way with his breeze.
Morning snow, plans to have a winter ball for you to throw
But just where or when, he never lets you know,
If it's snow, or clear days you'll find.
And so you wait to see what he'll do
Is it sun or snow for you?
But it breaks your heart in two
cos you've been fooled by    Ap -ril...
And he's gone,
And he's gone.
Winter's gone
you find it's   Oc -to -ber...
And she's gone,
And she's gone.
Summer's gone,
you've been fooled by  Ap  -ril...
And he's gone,
And he's gone
Winter's gone,
you find it's  Oc  -to -ber...
And she's gone,
And she's gone.
Summer's gone,
you've been fooled by  Ap  -ril...
And he's gone,
And he's gone.
Winter's gone,

There's no sense to sit and watch the people die
  We don't fight our wars the   way you do
  We put back all the things we use
On Saturn
There's no sense to keep on doing such crimes
  There's no principles in what you say
  No direction in the things you do

  Going back to Saturn where the   people smile

Just to live to us is our natural high
  We have come here many times before
  To find your strategy to peace is war
Killing helpless men, women and children
That don't even know what they're dying for
  We can't trust you when you take a stand
  With a burning bible in your hand
And a cold expression on your face
Saying give us what we want or we'll destroy

You can walk along a crowded street.
But the city really ain't no bigger than the friendly
People, friendly people that you meet.
You might be a sweet young, sweet young pretty, pretty,
And at the dances you can't keep your seat.
But, if dances don't lead to romances,
You might as well be born, be born with two left feet.
You might be a sweet-toned sure ‘nuff high-class talker,
You might be a stone, stone expert at kissing.
But it don't do too much good to be talkin',
Brother, when there ain't no, ain't nobody lis'nin'.
And if you are shy, just not much of a talker,
Don't impress the people that you meet.
You might as well be a lonely walker in a lonely town,
on a lonely street.

Wallowing in his victory   will be his only way of having fun

Cause her heart is as cold as the mirror she looks in

Around her heart that's ice
You better let it melt, for heaven's sake

Oh, a great big star one day

 I wanna say,  I been cryin'  without your love
 The night time find me     wetting my pillow
But I,   I don't,   I don't mind,  no
But if you,  you just let me say it again
I've been cryin'
I wish your trouble would leave me alone
But   I've been cryin'
Oh, come on and stop the rain right now,  yeah
Stop the rain, stop the rain, stop the rain, yeah
Baby,     baby,  yeah
  Oh, what a wonderful   thing   love is

How I wish for school days
How we used to run and play,     oh baby
Now those days are gone
But we keep on going on
Wondering where they're gone
School days
I remember my love
Man, good times were easy all the time
How she really blew my mind
Oh, won't you come back to me
Oh darling, can't you see
I need you here with me always
Oh baby, let me say that it's
Easy together
Loving you whether
Whether you're near or far, oh
Now that we are young
We might as well have some fun
Now that you know
Where I'm comin' from
Oh, my life        is just your, your
             Honey I'll do most anything
Oh just come back to me
I need you desperately
Honey, won't you stay with me always

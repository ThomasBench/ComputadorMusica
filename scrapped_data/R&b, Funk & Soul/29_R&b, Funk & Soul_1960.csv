0,End Of The Line,Nina Simone,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/nina-simone/end-of-the-line-chords-3246236,"This is the end of the line
I've clearly read every sign
The way you glance at me
Indifferently
And take your hand from mine
This is the end of the line
How can I ever be fine
How helpless I've become
I feel like some discarded valentine
Remember in the beginning
Your winning ways excited me
And all the while I was certain
That we two found a love that comes just to a few
Now,  We've reached the end of the line
I hope your dreams turn out fine
I'm awfully tired
And so
I guess I'll go
Although it's only nine
But  this is the end of the line
The end of the line

which one I choose?
Either way I lose
Though I know, my love is true.
I'd die if you ever told me good-bye.
Ever told me good-bye.

Has found my poor heart again
As I watch love walking away
It brings back old memories
A familiar pain still feels the same

Oh, when she told me goodbye
Now there's nothing left but emptiness
And the tears that fill my crying eyes

Without love, he walks in the dark
If love deserts him it will surely hurt him
Cos his weakness is his heart

It so hard to face reality
Knowing loneliness is my destiny
Because I've passed this way before

You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
How long must I wait?
How much more can I take?
Before loneliness will cause my heart
Heart to break?
No I can't bear to live my life alone
I grow impatient for a love to call my own
But when I feel that I, I can't go on
These precious words keeps me hanging on
I remember mama said:
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
She said love don't come easy
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
You got to trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes
No, love, love don't come easy
But I keep on waiting
Anticipating 
for that soft voice
To talk to me at night
For some tender arms
To hold me tight
I keep waiting
I keep on waiting
But it ain't easy
It ain't easy
But mama said
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait
You got to trust, give it time
No matter how long it takes
You can't hurry love
No, you just have to wait . . .

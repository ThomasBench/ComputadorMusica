0,Brother (ver 2),Amy Winehouse,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/amy-winehouse/brother-chords-640057," Brother;
 There's so much that I could never say to your face.
But by now,
 You should know the world and all its ways; so find your place.
 How do I find words that do not condescend,
When she bore you be-fore me?
 'Cos she doesn't need a child; she needs a friend.
A son, not a sob sto-ry.     (Ooh, ooh, hoo).
 Now you must look out for her, the way she did for you.
And your priority; it must be her.
 Now you must look out for her, the way she did for you.
 'Cos we'll never be the way we were.    (Ooh, ooh, hoo).
 She can't always be there, just to hold you down; our mother.
When you are at an age now, where life turns a-round, my brother.
 Realise;
That you don't have to answer to no man,
Re-sponsibility comes down to you.
 But how can I expect you to understand,
When you live life like you're so run through?
 Now you must look out for her, the way she did for you.
And your priority; it must be her.
 Now you must look out for her, the way she did for you.
 'Cos we'll never be the way we were.
 Now you must look out for her, the way she did for you.
And your priority; it must be her.
 Now you must look out for her, the way she did for you.
 'Cos we'll never be the way we were.
 The way we were,  we'll never be.
 (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh).
And your pri-ority it must be her.
 (Ooh, ooh, hoo).

Daydreaming about you all day in school, can't concentrate
Wanna have your voice in my ear
'Til mama comes and says it's too late
'Cause the lights are on outside
Wish there was somewhere to hide
'Cause I just don't want to say goodbye
'Cause you are my baby, baby
Nothing really matters
I don't really care
What nobody tell me
I'm gonna be here
It's a matter of extreme importance
My first teenage love affair
Another secret meeting
On the fifth floor stair case
I'm gonna give you this letter
Of all the things I can't say
Want you to be my first, my last, my ending and beginning, yeah
I wrote your name in my book
Your last name, my first
I'm your Mrs
'Cause the lights are on outside
Wish there was somewhere to hide
'Cause I just don't want to say goodbye
'Cause you are my baby, baby
Nothing really matters
I don't really care
What nobody tell me
I'm gonna be here
It's a matter of extreme importance
My first teenage love affair
Hey boy
You know I really like being with you, right?
Just hanging out with you is fun
So maybe we can go to:
first base
Second base
Third base
Well baby, slow down
'Cause the lights are on outside (Outside)
Wish there was somewhere to hide (To hide)
'Cause I just don't want to say goodbye
'Cause you are my baby, baby
Nothing really matters
I don't really care
What nobody tell me
I'm gonna be here
It's a matter of extreme importance
My first teenage love affair
Nothing really matters
I don't really care
What nobody tell me
I'm gonna be here
It's a matter of extreme importance
My first teenage love affair

Nosey cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hating

Look at me, I say, ""Yeah, it's the same dough""
We the same type, you my air of life
You have sleeping in the same bed day and night
Go rock with me, you deserve the best

    And straight reality is always cold
    Saying something hard edged is off the wall
    And it might seem too bold
Mocked me when it got out of hand
Nobody tried to understand
Now we got to keep it simple and that's that
Well I'm down here on the running board
Where I've been many times before
But we got to keep it simple to save ourselves

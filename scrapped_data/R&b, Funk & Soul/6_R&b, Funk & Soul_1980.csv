side;
 Every moment takes me, to para-dise.
Darlin'... let me hold you;
 Warm you in my arms, and melt your
fears a-way.
Show you...
 All the magic that a perfect love can
make; I need you night and day.
So baby, be mine, (baby, you gotta be
mine),
And girl, I'll give you all I got to give.
So baby, be my girl, (all the time),
And we can share this ecstasy, as long as
we believe, in love.
 I won't give you reason, to change your
mind,
 You are all the future, that I de-sire.
Girl... I need to hold you,
 Share my feelings in the heat of love's
em-brace.
Show you...
All the passion burning in my heart,
to-day; it's never gonna fade.
So baby, be mine, (baby, you gotta be
mine),
And girl, I'll give you all I got to give.
So baby, be my girl,
You're everything this world could be; the reason that I live.
 Won't you stay with me, un-til the mornin' sun?
 I promise you now; that the dawn will be different.
 Lady, can't you see, that Heaven's just begun?
 It's livin' here, inside our hearts.
 There'll be no more mountains, for us to climb,
 This will be a love, lasting for all time.
Girl... you got to hold me,
 We can touch the sky and light the
darkest day.
 Hold me... only you and I, can make sweet
love this way;
There's no more I can say.
So baby, be mine, (baby, you gotta be
mine),
And girl, I'll give you all I got to give.

It's not that I shouldn't really love you,
Let's take it slow.
When we get to know each other,
And we're both feeling much stronger.
Then let's try to talk it over,
Let's wait awhile longer.
Let's wait awhile,
Before it's too late.
Let's wait awhile,
Before we go      too far.
Remember that special night,
When all of the stars were shining bright?
We made our first endeavor
To stay together.
We made our very first promise,
To love, to share and be real honest.
But on that very first night,
It wasn't quite right.
Let's wait awhile,
     Before it's too late.
Let's wait awhile,
    Our love will deepen.
Let's wait awhile,
Before we go      too far.
I didn't really know,
Not to let all my feelings show.
To save some for later,
So our love can be greater.
You said you would always love me,
Remember I said the same thing too.
You don't have to be frightened with my love,
Because I'll never give up on you.
    Let's wait awhile,
       Before it's too late.
     You know you can't rush love,
Love.
Let's wait awhile,
    Before it's too late.
Let's wait awhile,
    Our love will deepen.
Let's wait awhile,
Before we go    too  far.
Ah,       oh look.
Let's wait awhile,
    Before it's too late.
Let's wait awhile,
    Our love will deepen.
Let's wait awhile,
Before we go    too  far.
Oh.

    Da la dat da dat da la.

    Da la dat da dat da la.
La da da lay dat da dat da dee dee,

     I'll be worth the wait.

How can it be
Carved out of caring
Could suffer so hard
Played once too often
But making mistakes
Of lifes imperfections
Is it so wrong
To be human after all
Drawn into the stream
Of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They cant disguise the truth
That there is something about you
Baby so right
I wouldnt be without you
Baby tonight
If ever our love 
No one can say that
A million things
And a perfect dream of life
Fragile but free
Tender together 
And its not so wrong
Were only human after all
These changing years
They add to your confusion
Oh and you need to hear
The time that told the truth
You know theres something about you
Baby so right
I wouldnt be without you
Baby tonight
Because theres something about you
Baby so right
I couldnt live without you
Baby tonight

Dropped her price and pride, she made it totally
Clear that she was his for a night, but he said

Bark is much worse than my bite
He said leave me alone, I'm a family man, if you
Push me too far I just might
She gave him her look, it would have worked on
Any other man around
He looked her up and down. she knew he couldn't
De-cide if he should hold his ground, but he said
Leave me alone, I'm a family man and my

Opening move her final exit line, he
Waited much too long, But by the time he got his
Courage up she was gone, and he screamed

Bark is much worse than my bite
He's just leave me alone, I'm a family man, if you
Push me too far I just might         he said

Of what love brings
Then endings are beginnings
Of beautiful things
It's a chance you take
A chance you're in
If someone's gonna find you
First you've got to let them in 'cause
Love begins with one hello
The hardest part is over
Now it's easy letting go
  One hello is how it starts
You might win in love
Or lose your heart
If you're not afraid
Of what you feel
Then try to keep it simple
But try and keep it real
And if bein' real
Means that someday you'd say goodbye
Remember my friends
Goodbye's not the end
 It's a circle you know
And it starts with   one hello
Love begins with one hello
The hardest part is over
Now it's easy letting go
  One hello is how it starts

Good-bye's not the end

And it starts with   one hello
It starts with   one   hello

But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back down

Took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star

A female Shakespeare of your time
With looks to blow  Picasso's mind
You were the best
Your body moved with grace and song
Like symphonies by Bach or Brahms
Nevertheless, oh oh
You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star

Would make hell's fire seem like a spark
Where did it go
Just why that you would overnight
Turn love to stone as cold as ice
I'll never know
You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back down

Took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star

But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one

What I want you've got
And it might be hard to handle
Like the flame that burns the candle
The candle feeds the flame, yeah, yeah
What I've got's full stock
Of thoughts and dreams that scatter
Then you pull them all together
And how I can't explain
Well, well you (Ooh-ho, hoo-ooh, ooh-oo)
You make my dreams come true (You-hoo, you, you-hoo, hoo, you, hoo)
Well, well, well you (You-hoo, hoo-hoo-ooh)
You make my dreams come true (You-hoo, you, you-hoo, hoo, you, hoo)
On a night when bad dreams become a screamer
When they're messin' with the dreamer
I can laugh it in the face
Twist and shout my way out
And wrap yourself around me
'Cos I ain't the way you found me
And I'll never be the same
Well, 'cos you (Ooh-ho, hoo-ooh, ooh-oo)
You make my dreams come true (You-hoo, you, you-hoo, hoo, you, hoo)
Well, well, well you(You-hoo, hoo-hoo-ooh)
You make my dreams come true (You-hoo, you, you-hoo, hoo, you, hoo)
Listen to this
I'm down on my daydream
Oh, that sleepwalk should be over by now
I know
'Bout you
Yeah, yeah
You make my dreams come true (You-hoo, you, you-hoo, hoo, you, hoo)
I've been waiting for, waiting for you, girl(You-hoo, hoo-hoo-ooh)
You make my dreams come true(You-hoo, you, you-hoo, hoo, you, hoo)
I've been waiting for, waiting for you, girl(You-hoo, hoo-hoo-ooh)
You make my dreams come true(You-hoo, you, you-hoo, hoo, you, hoo)

Why I've even been out walking
They tell me that it helps
But I know when I'm beaten

All those lonely films
And all those lonely parties
But now the feeling is off-screen
An' the tears for real not acted, anymore

I'm all mixed up inside
I want to run but I can't hide
And however much we try
We can't escape the truth and the fact is
Don't matter what I do
It don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
'Cause I end up hurting you

One more covered sigh
And one more glance you know means goodbye
Can't you see that's why
We're dashing ourselves against the rocks of a lifetime
Don't matter what I do
It don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
Don't matter what I do
'Cause I end up hurting you
(In my mind different voices call)
What once was pleasure now's pain for us all
(In my heart only shadows fall)
I once stood proud now I feel so small
(I don't know whether to laugh or cry)

In daytime showers they've become my beat
As I walk from caf? to bar
I wish I knew where you are
Because you've clouded my mind
And now I'm all out of time
Empty skies say try to forget
Better advice is to have no regrets
As I tread the boulevard floor
Will I see you once more?
Because you've clouded my mind
'Till then I'm biding my time.
I'm only sad in a natural way
And I enjoy sometimes feeling this way
The gift you gave is desire
The match that started my fire
Empty nights with nothing to do
I sit and think, ev'ry thought is for you
I get so restless and bored
So I go out once more.
I hate to feel so confined
Feel like I'm wasting my time
I'm only sad in a natural way
And I enjoy sometimes feeling this way
The gift you gave is desire
The match that started my fire
The match that started my fire
The match that started my fire
The match that started my fire

You're there to save my life for our obvious goal
We've got a head start for happiness
For our part, guess we must be blessed
For this feeling to be so strong
Tell me is that so wrong?
The space between us for days has been so far;
I've spent a lonely week Now I wanna be where you are
We've got a headstart for happiness, 
For our part, Guess we must be kissed by 
This force I feel inside
Now I'm not gonna hide.
All the roads that lead to struggles
bring you back to where you need
Some reassurance in your own depth,
only you can see, but let others feel
Peace in my mind I'm so happy to find
As I get on my trek with a head start back to you.
You'll find it can happen
You'll find you've got the strength
You can move a mountain
You just need the confidence
In yourself and all you've got 
To take this world and shake it up
Let no one say they're better than you
You must believe you've got the power
To rise above the lies
Cause what we're dealing here with today is a love thing
Right here, right now
Now listen
When I find you waiting hours, oh
It's my heart, not my head that takes control
And you've got to lead where your heart says go
and this hope that it turns out so
And that's all that you can hope for
Can you expect much more?
Naive and wise with no sense of time
As I set my clock with a heart beat, tick tock
Violent and mild, common sense says I'm wild
With this mixed up fury, crazy beauty
It's healthy to find all these feelings inside
As I get on my trek with a head start back to you.

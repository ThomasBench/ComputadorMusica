0,Stranger In My House,Tamia,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tamia/stranger-in-my-house-chords-3776957,"I don't understand
You look just like the man
In the picture by our bed
The suspense is pounding and clouding up my head
And you wear the same size shoe
You sleep in his spot
But I don't know just who you are
There's a stranger in my house
It took a while to figure out
There's no way you could be who you say you are
You gotta be someone else
'Cause he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me
So I'm convinced there's a stranger in my
house
Don't see your shadow around when you walk
You leave with no kisses, goodbye with no words
If these walls could talk they would have nothing to tell
Is there someone imitating me?
Could she be taking my place?
And tell me that I'm wrong when I say
There's a stranger in my house
It took a while to figure out
There's no way you could be who you say you are
You gotta be someone else
'Cause he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me
So I'm convinced there's a stranger in my house
Pop quiz
Tell me where we first kissed
Tell me where my spot is
Tell me if I liked it, loved it
Or could it be
That the stranger is me?
Have I changed so drasticly?
Is it I want more for me?
And you remain the
same
It took a while to figure out
You can't be who you say you are
You gotta be someone else
'Cause he wouldn't touch me like that
And he wouldn't treat me like you do
He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me
So I'm convinced there's a stranger in my house
Took a while to figure out
He would adore me, he wouldn't ignore me
I'm convinced there's a stranger in my house

 Last man on the earth still couldn't hit this

 Seeing right through you like you're bathing in Windex

 You on your job
 Ain't gon' feed you
 Easping for air
 You out of breath
 Hope you ain't waiting
 Telling the world how much you miss me
 But we never were
 You a mom and pop

 I'm the press conference

Första semestern på fyra år
Som jag förstod var vi förälskade
Du sa att ingen vart så bra som jag
Vi talade om allt och älskade
Jag låna pengar och kom till din stad
Varför ska man tänka på någon annan än sig själv?

Du bad mig vänta på dig utanför
Redan då förstod jag att nånting förändrades
Din blick var annorlunda än jag kom ihåg
Jag fråga vad det var, du svarade
Det fanns en på ditt jobb du tyckte bättre om
Så du bad mig komma hit för att få dumpa mig
Du sa, ""Bättre på plats än genom telefon""

They be starin at the money like its unfamiliar
I get it, I live it, to me theres nothings realer
Just enough to solve your problems, too much will kill ya
   The young spit'a that everybody in rap fear
   A lot of yall are still soundin like last year
The game needs change and im the mofucking cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious ya hate me
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture no HD
Yeah, I want it all, That's why I strive for it
Dis me and you'll never hear a reply for it
Any awards show or party I get fly for it
I know that it's comin' I just hope that I'm alive for it
I want the money, Money and the cars,
Cars and the clothes, The hoes
I suppose,
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
Yeah, I want things to go my way
But as of late a lot of shit been goin sideways
But I left somethin in the car and so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me so I cried too
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got pulled up
Damn, my reality just set in
My girl love me but fuck it my heart beat slow
And right now the tour bus is lookin like a freak show
And life change for us every single week
So its good but I know this ain't the peak though, cause I want
Wise words from a decent man
And my delivery just got me buzzin like the pizza man
In person I am everything and more
I'm on a shoppin spree to get whateva is in store
Yeah, just call me shop and bag drizzy
While this youngin that you doubtin is about to get busy
Im'ma kill it I promise this I know you mad
Ive always treated my city like some shoulder pads
To big homie use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't askin for much, all I want is
Pardon the swag , but bitches cartate
Cheese, But shes not in this portrait
And Im'ma fuck the world, but this is just foreplay
Tired of hearing bullshit, bring her on to cow shit
So high up I got birds in the condo
Ain't that a female dog
Ask her who I am to her and she yell god
Weezy baby I go real hard

Cause you don't know who I was before you
Basically to see a change in me
I'd be losing so I just ignore you, yeah
But you're on my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
But maybe in time, in time, in time, I'll tell you I'm...
A little bit, a little bit, a little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit, a little bit in love with you

But it's you I wanna take apart

But still I...
They know I... Ah ah ah
I would do it, push a button,
Pull a trigger, climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff 'cause you know baby 
I love you love you a little bit
You would do it, you would say it
And you would mean it, and we could do it
It was you and I and I only I mm-
Think I'm a little bit, little bit, a little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit, little bit, little bit in lalalalalove with me
I hope they never find out what they already know, know, know
As soon as it's official 
We'll have to let it go, go, go
So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You could teach me many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson
Both hearts beat like a metronome
Both in sync like a Justin song
I wonder where my world 'bout
Where niggas that I know tryna talk my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
Oh well, tell her fall back caught up in some more shit tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheating on her ass wit a girl that I know yeah tell h

You know sometimes it'd be like that, baby
   Now every time I see you, I pretend I'm fine
   When I wanna reach out to you
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride
Baby, I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
  And don't forget about
  Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
 I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
  I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
 When it's for real, it's forever
Oh, they say that you're in a new relationship
 But we both know nothing comes close to
  What we had, it perseveres
 That we both can't forget it
 How good we used to get it
  There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine (We used to shine)
No matter who you go through
We are one, that's a fact that you can't deny
So, baby, we just can't let the fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret

Get them off my back today
Can you feel it?

Chasing rainbows
   Can't you see I'm going insane?
I wanna be a free man
   But I'm spinning on this crazy wheel
I'm jumping for the high bar, can't you dig it?

You re-apply your lippy cos it came off on the glass
The DJ plays your favourite song, Kanye's on
Now ya beckoning for me to dance
Mmmm, pullin me, pullin me, pullin me close
Just close your eyes girl
Whispering, tellin' me we gotta go

She takes it to the corner

I can hear her shouting,
Banging fists against the door
Yelling yo it's over I can't take it any more
Then I walk away
And act all nonchalant and chill
I ain't tryna get all
Caught up in her mess for real
But she came on out
And backed me up against the wall
She said I know you heard
But I'll make you forget it all

Every corner we turn only leads to another

47,En Kort En Lang,Lisa Nilsson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lisa-nilsson/en-kort-en-lang-chords-112027,"Min käre vän 
kom och sätt dig hos mig
lägg din hand i min
Du är så vacker
Dina bara ben och klännigen är fin
Det kan ta tid men om vi försöker kommer det att gå
Torka bort dina tårar så kan du se
varthän du ska gå
Vi går tillsamans
En kort en lång 
så blev det soluppgång
Vi får allt vad vi pekar på
För världen är så stor
och över oss är himlen blå

48,What About Love,Lemar,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lemar/what-about-love-chords-520802,"What if I took my time 
to love you?
What if I put no 
one above you?
What if I did the 
things That really mattered?
What if I ran through
Hoops of disaster? 
No one would care if
We never made it
We're in this alone
So why don't we face it
There is no room to
Blame one another
We just need time to
Forgive each other 
What about love?
What about feeling?
What about all the things that make life worth 
living? What about 
faith? What about 
trust? And 
tell me baby...
what about
us?
How can I give this
Love new beginning?
How can I stop the rain?
It's never ending
How do I keep my 
soul believing?
Memories of how we
Should be keep calling 
What about love?
What about feeling?
What about all the things that make life worth 
living? What about 
faith? What about 
trust? And 
tell me baby...
what about
us?
I'll take the rivers rise
I'll take the happy times
I'll take the moments of disaster 
What about love?
What about feeling?
What about all the things that make life worth 
living? What about 
faith? What about 
trust? And 
tell me baby...
what about
us?

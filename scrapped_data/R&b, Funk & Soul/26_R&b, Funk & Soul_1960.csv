won't now.

Well, I won't treat her with kid gloves, and I won't shower 
But I'll make an angel of this little girl.
Oh, ahh, this little girl tries to make every guy her slave, oh, 
But this little man is gonna take her by the hand and I'm 
gonna show her the way to behave.
Oh, this little girl is kinda used to gettin' her way, but no 
more now.
There'll gonna be some changes made startin' today.
Oh, oh, I said, now, everyone will be surprised when I cut her 
down to size and no one's gonna recognize my little girl.
I tell you again, now, this little girl, I'm her man, now.

Don't take her out of my life
Don't take her out of my life, oh no
Let the moon glow
On the fallen snow
But I just got to know
Know she'll be a part of my life
Know she'll be a part of my life, forever
Let the bees make honey, let the poor find money
Take away their sorrow, give them sunshine tomorrow
But don't take her out of my life, don't take her out of my life
What would I do without her tell me now
Let the bird sing
With the coming spring
Let the church bells ring
Let the rain fall, let the grass grow
Let the moon glow on the fallen snow

        No good would it do you to stand there and frown at me
        The girl's got my heart and my love's comin' down on me
        My life's kinda mellow since I    got a taste of wild honey
        You know she's got the sweetness of a honey bee
        Wild honey, she got it hard and stung me good, yessirree
        With all the other stud bees buzzin' all around her hive
        She singled me out, single-handed took me alive
        Can you dig it gonna take my life eatin' up her wild honey
        / / / /  / / / /  / / / /  / / / /    (x2)
        Oh, mama she's sweeter (gettin' sweeter)
        Sweeter, sweeter, ah...
        Wild honey, oh let me tell you how she really got to my soul
        It ain't funny the way she makes me want to sing a little rock 'n roll
        There's nothing quite as sweet as a taste of wild honey
        I break my back workin' just to save me some money
        So I can spend my life with her... sock it to me, wild honey

45,Without Love There Is Nothing,Ray Charles,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ray-charles/without-love-there-is-nothing-chords-1244902,"I awakened this morning I was filled with despair
All my dreams turned to ashes and gone oh yeah
As I looked at my life it was barren and bare
Without love I've had nothing at all  
Once I had a sweetheart who loved only me
There was nothing oh that she would not give  oh no
But I was blind to her goodness and I could not see
That a heart without love cannot live
Without love  I've had nothing
Without love I've had nothing at all
I have conquered the world all but one thing did I have
Without love I've had nothing at all

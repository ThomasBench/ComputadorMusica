0,Never Break (ver 2),John Legend,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-legend/never-break-chords-3209411,"    Oh, yeah
We got a good thing, babe
Whenever life is hard
We'll never lose our way
'Cause we both know who we are
Who knows about tomorrow?
We don't know what's in the stars
I just know I'll always follow
The light in your heart
  I'm not worried about us
  And I've never been
  We know how the story ends
We will never break
We will never break
Built on a foundation
Strong enough to stay
We will never break
As the water rises
And the mountains shake
Our love will remain
We will never
Nah, nah, never
We will never
Nah, nah, never
It's more than a good sensation
It's more than a passing fling
You are the explanation
Of what love really means
It's bigger than you and me
It's one plus one equals three
When we talk about forever
Then forever's what we mean
  So, I’m not worried about us
  And I've never been
  No matter what may come our way
We will never break
We will never break
Built on a foundation
Strong enough to stay
We will never break
As the water rises
And the mountains shake
Our love will remain
We will never
Nah, nah, never
We will never
Nah, nah, never
We will never
Nah, never
We will never
No
  The world is dangerous
  Throw it all at us
  There's nothing we cannot take
We will never break
We will never break
Built on a foundation
Strong enough to stay
We will never break
As the water rises
And the mountains shake
Our love will remain
We will never
Nah, nah, never
We will never
Nah, nah, never
We will never
Nah, never
We will never
No
We will never
No, never
We will
No

25,On Sunset Album,Paul Weller,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/paul-weller/on-sunset-chords-3239699,"Mirror ball, when will you spin?
Light up the room and our lives begin
Till we no longer feel the cold
We're now embraced by the mirror ball
The sound of soul spins through the air
Lifting up our hearts, our eyes and our ears
Till we no longer accept our fate
We're now empowered in your wake
And the moon
And the sun
And the love
For the one
And in every brick I pass I see you
In every blade of grass I feel you
       In everything
Mirror ball, you shine so bright
Illuminate the ways of our sight
Till everyone's a shining star
The moon's a balloon and we'll go far
And the moon
And the sun
And the love
For the one
And in every brick I pass I see you
In every blade of grass I feel you
In every silver sky I see you
The streets that pass me by, I feel you
        In everything
Till everyone's a shining star
Till everyone's a shining star
And the stars
And the rain
And the love
Fills the sea
For the one
For the one
I never used to pray
I never been to church
But when I hear that sound it goes to my heart
Straight to my soul, Oh, I don't know
Straight to my soul
If I've got a God
It's in the stars above
But when I get that sound
Oh, it makes me strong
Feeling real
Not a choice
A melody strong
An angel's voice
And I find myself. Find myself
In awe of its truth
And when I go, I go where I go
As long as I have that sound
I'm gonna go real slow
Straight to my heart. Hey, I don't know
Straight to my soul
Feeling real
It's not a choice
A melody strong
An angel's voice
And I find myself. Find myself
In awe of its truth
From the mountains high. To the valleys low
From the oceans deep. To the sky so wide
As long as I got that sound
As long as I got that sound
Like those tired branches
On that old oak tree
Strange beauty in winter
But how sweeter   in spring
Time will become you
You'll become time
All hail the love
It’s the love   divine
We don't know
We can't always see
But Old Father Tyme
Ah, you know that he don’t care
Whatever he gives you
Has a price to bear
In this time of confusion
Hang onto what is real
Hail the love around us
See how deep it  feels
We don't know
We can't always see
But Old Father Tyme
Ah, you know that he don't care
Whatever he brings you
Got a price to bear
Woo! Yes, I'm ready, ready
Yes, I'm ready rider
Woo! I'm ready, ready
Yes, I'm ready rider
Woo! I’m ready, ready
Ow! Yes, ready rider
Woo! Yes, ready, ready
Sit in the sun
Writing these songs to the ocean
Woo! I’m ready, ready
Yes, I'm ready rider
Woo! I’m ready, ready
Wow! I'm ready rider
Yes, I'm ready, ready
Ow! I'm ready rider
Here I am ten stories high
Not a single cloud in my eyes
Not a thing I'd change if I could
I'm happy here in my neighbourdhood
And all the things I've never been
I've never seen I don't care much
An' all the things I've never done
I've never won I don't care much
I never knew what a world this was
'till I looked in my heart
And saw myself for what I am
found a whole world in my hand
And all the things I'm supposed to be
An' all the things that you want from me
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't need all the things you got
I just wanna be who I want
I don't need all the things you hold
In high regard they mean nothing at all
And all the things I've never been
I've never seen I don't care much
An' all the things I've never done
I've never won I don't care much
This village is where I'm from
It's one place that I call home
You wanna show me ""another side""
But I got heaven in my sights
I never knew what a world this was
'till I looked in my heart
And saw myself for what I am
found a whole world in my hand
And all the things I've never seen
I've never been I don't care much
An' all the things I've never done
I've never won I don't
Madly rushing through the streets
There's no more hours left to give
When nothing comes of nothing
Full of empty thoughts of more
Faut-il aller jusqu'au bout?
Même si je contrôle tout?
All I do is use my time
Dreaming of a place
Where I'd find such happiness
But little came from having more
The more we get, the more we lose
When all is ""more"", it's more we choose
There's always something else in store
That keeps me running down that road, keeps me running
To an unknown place I think is more
How much higher can I be?
Sailing moonbeams, scaling trees
Pushing upwards to the sky
Picking up what I think's mine
When nothing comes from nothing
Dreaming of a place
Where I'd find such happiness
But little came from having more
The more we get, the more we lose
When all is ""more"", it's more we choose
There's always something else in store
That keeps me running down that road, keeps me running
To an unknown place I think is more
I was gonna say hi
But no one there
There's me forgetting
Just how long it's been
And the palm trees sway
As a warm breeze blew
And the sun was high
On Sunset
And the world I knew
Has all gone by
All the places we used to go
Belong to a time
Someone else's life
Another time
No long goodbyes
I have no point to prove
Take a drink in the Whiskey
Moved on to the Rainbow
And the palm trees sway
They say good day
And the sun was high, high
On Sunset
But the world I knew
Has all moved on
All the places that we used to go
Belong to a time
Someone else's life
Another time
And the world I knew
Has all gone by
All the places we used to go
Belong to a time
Someone else's life
Another time
And the palm trees sway
As a warm breeze blew
And the sun was high, high
Higher than it ever been before
And the palm trees sway (Palm trees sway)
As a warm breeze blew
And it blew my mind
On Sunset
On Sunset
On Sunset
On Sunset
On Sunset
On Sunset
What ya gonna do when the light
Slips from your eyes?
And what will you keep bar the penny
In your fist for the tide?
Become the joke because you can't let go
You suffer hurt because you can't let go
Give the penny to the boatman
See he guides you well
Reflect upon the water
As you reflect upon yourself
This river always will be here
Always rushing here
All traces disappear
So, as equanimity shows
To try and stay in control
And not fall apart
Slow, the ataraxy will grow
As the shepherd has shown
Gentleness and kindness
Is what our world needs now
Find it in my heart somehow
Oh yeah you know
This river always will be here
Always rushing here
All traces disappear
And soon, equanimity blooms
Giving scent to the room
You might not have noticed
Ah, and so, some self control
Might save the day
Which is worth saving
It's what our world needs now
Let's find it in our hearts somehow
You know, yeah, you know
Baby, don't be slow
The world ain't gonna go till we're out walkin'
Leave all the baggage at the door
You won't need it anymore 'cause we're out walkin'
Take that hate
And turn the world around
Get some faith
And plant it in the ground
The flags don't cut it anymore
The same old lines we've heard before
Leave your baggage at the door
You won't need it anymore we're out walkin'
It takes nothing to be kind
It's just another state of mind you ain't used to
Take that hate
And turn the world around
Get some faith
And plant it in the ground
The flags don't cut it anymore
The same old lines we've heard before
  So, baby, don't be slow
The world ain't gonna go
Till we're out walkin' (Walkin')
   Walkin'
   Walkin'
She's a new day
A new morning
On a new day
The world is turning
She's a new day
A new morning
She's a songbird
She's the warning
I feel that earth beat close to mine
And I'd know that earth beat any time
She's a new day
She's a warning
That on a new day
The world is turning
She's a new day
A new morning
But she's a songbird
She's the warning
It's just the start of something fine
That heartbeat burns through age and time
I feel that earth beat close to mine
And I'd know that earth beat any time
It's a new day in the morning
And the sun shines whilst we're gone now
And my heart beats to my beat
Don't burst me, oh I'm not slowing down
Leave the old news right behind you
I'm the only one gonna find you
And my heart beats to my beat
Don't burst me, oh I'm not slowing down…
She's a new day
She's a warning
That on a new day
The world is turning
She's a new day
A new morning
But she's a songbird
She's the warning
It's a new day in the morning
And the sun shines we're still going up
And your heart beats to my beat
Songbird sleep oh ain't no slowing up
He went off
Like a rocket touched
Way up in the sky
Beyond the bars
In our minds
Just took off
Rocket to the sun
Blast his way through here
Beyond the world
In our eyes
We grow up
If we can join the dots
That got us here to there
Beyond our dreams
In the spheres
We go off
Like little fireworks
Exploding in the streets
And crumpled sheets
Where we lie
All our lives
The system all decides
The institution's old
But still in control
Nothing in the chambers
Worth nothing at all
All the wealth is hidden
Diamonds a-glistening and solid gold
Well, have it all
It's worthless

Nothing in the chambers
Worth nothing at all
All the wealth is hidden
Diamonds a-glistening and solid gold
Well, have it all

Lo tengo guardado
El secreto que nunca nos hemos gritado.
Cómo no me voy a sentir avergonzado
Si mis celos hicieron
Que todo estuviera apagado, aplastado
No estoy encontrado
Por eso todo es así
Yo ya te mostré mis esquemas
Ahora necesito aclarar tus problemas
Entonces qué quieres
Qué buscas, qué tienes
Dime qué prefieres.

You can ignore this if you want
Who am I to tell you what to do
Or not to do
     Do what I didn't do
Make the choices I didn’t make
Support your community
   Start with your neighbor and walk outward
 Introduce yourself by name
Why not go for that coffee
You always end the conversation on?
Spend time with your friends and family
 Call them, text them
Write them a letter if you’re feeling nostalgic
 It might be hard, but tell them you love them
They won’t be around forever
Respect the ground you walk on
Your kids are gonna walk on it someday too
And their kids after that
 And you don’t want your grandchildren
Only seeing elephants in picture books
Get up every day
Make the bed all nice
 And fling open the curtains
Feel the sun on your face
Look into the mirror and think
“Wow, I’m amazing”
 Don’t dwell on Instagram
 There far better things to do than that
      But if I have to tell you one thing to change
  Smile more
Just smile more
 Put down your phone
 See the world through your own eyes
 Create memories, not in JPEGS
Be creative
Draw, learn a language
Dance even if it feels really awkward
Why worry about something now
 That you won’t worry about a year from now?
Remember, no matter how difficult things get
The sun will always rise again tomorrow
 Pay someone a compliment
The checkout assistant, the postman
 I know it would make mine
Challenge yourself
Challenge others
 Bring something out of someone
        Look, no one knows where they're going
 You don’t have to follow a path or
You don’t have to follow anything
Just do what feels right
 But if I had to tell you just one thing to change
         Just smile more

You gave me too much to feel
Everything, it feel too real
I don't wanna feel this much
You gave me too much pain
It does not feel the same
I don't wanna hurt this much
It's nothin' but pain in the mornin' when I wake up
I can't even eat, can't sleep, just stay up
Shame in your tone when you're sayin' that you're sorry
Please don't speak no more

I don't wanna feel too much
I don't wanna feel at all, feel at all

I don't wanna feel at all, feel at all
I been thinkin' 'bout it constantly, I really can't deny it
All the things I wanna say, I keep 'em all inside
Forget about forever, can you get me through tonight?
Maybe I could learn to live without you one day at a time
You had me at a place that I don't wanna go back to
One of us forgot we cut it out because we had to
And lyin' by omission is worse than fuckin' lying
We're lyin' to each other, so what's the point in trying?
When there's pain at night when I lay down
I don't wanna talk, no words I could say now

When you turn the lights out, you won't be scared anymore
You won't even care anymore
All that sugar's fucking up your teeth (Won't curse, sorry)
Messing with your gums
Nothing's right when you're 21
I want you to be proud of what you've done
Little bean
Sometimes I wish I could be anyone other than me
But then I just breathe, think about who I wanna be
I know I'm not around
I know I let you down
But I want to be better for you
Let me do that now
You're my favourite human
So you should be prepared
I'll help you get through it
When you're big and scared
Little bean
There are things scarier than clowns
I'm sorry to break it to you now
The monster in the dark is all around
But trust me you can beat it in a team
So try and open up to someone else
You can't fight a monster by yourself
No one ever knows you super well
But there's a person I want you to meet
And when that person offers out their hand
I want you to take it like a man
Hold with every muscle that you can
It's the closest you could ever feel to free
Sometimes I wanna be anyone other than me
But then I just breathe, think about who I wanna be
I know I'm not around
I know I've let you down
But I want to be better for you
Let me do that now
You're my favourite human
So you should be prepared
I'll help you get through it
When you're big and scared
Sadness will be par for the course
And you will feel hopeless, you're a child of divorce
And you will feel like you can't do it anymore
And one day you will try and you will fail to end it all
And that will be the saddest day you've ever felt before
But trust me when I say that you deserve to live for more
And when you feel the weight of the world on your shoulders
Remember what I told you
I know I'm not around
I know I've let you down
But I want to be better for you
Let me do that now
You're my favourite human
So you should be prepared
I'll help you get through it (Breathe)
When you're big and scared
I keep thinking I'm in a rush
But maybe I've been thinking too much
Maybe I don't want it enough
It's way too much pressure, uh-uh
I keep thinking I'm in a rush
Maybe I've been thinking too much
Maybe I don't want it enough
I'm way too much pressure, pressure

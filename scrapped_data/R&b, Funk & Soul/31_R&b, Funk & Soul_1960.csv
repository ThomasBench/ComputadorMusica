One of these days you're going to reach 18,
and all the boys ya see is gonna call ya a queen.
But the same little boys will make you cry.
So the best thing to do when you reach this age.
Is to be a good girl, remember what I say.
You make em wait. And pick your dates.
Woah-oh make em wait, pick your dates,
Know when true love comes your way.
There won't be much that you will say.
and he'll lead you right straight to the preacher man.

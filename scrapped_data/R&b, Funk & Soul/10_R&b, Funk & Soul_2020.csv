0,Is It Just Me,Sasha Sloan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/sasha-sloan/is-it-just-me-chords-3340568,"  Is it just me?
  Is it just me?
I hate holding babies
And people tryna save me
Think religion is a business
Where you pay for God's forgiveness
Modern art is boring
Politicians are annoying
I don't think love lasts forever
And old music was better
Am I just high or am I kinda right?
Is it just me or does anybody
Feel the way that I feel?
They're just not being real
Is it just me or is anybody
Thinkin' all the same shit?
They're just not sayin' it
  Is it just me?
Is it just me?
Weddings are outdated
The show Friends was overrated
I think rich kids have it easy
And PDA is creepy
The Internet's obnoxious
People my age make me nauseous
I think marijuana's classy
And doing coke is trashy
Am I just high or am I kinda right?
Is it just me or does anybody
Feel the way that I feel?
They're just not being real
Tell me, is it just me or is anybody
Thinkin' all the same shit?
They're just not sayin' it
  Is it just me?
Is it just me?
I    should probably bite my tongue but
I    can't be the only one
I    should probably bite my tongue but
I can't be the only one, or
Is it just me or does anybody
Feel the way that I feel?
They're just not being real
Tell me, is it just me or is anybody
Thinkin' all the same shit?
They're just not sayin' it
  Is it just me?
Is it just me?
I    should probably bite my tongue but
I    can't be the only one
I    should probably bite my tongue but
I can't be the only one, or

I can't help but think
That our roads might take us down different phases
Don't wanna complicate the rhythm that we've got
But I'm speechless
When everything's so pure, can it be aimless?
Painless?
If you ever go, all the songs that we like
Will sound like bittersweet lullabies
Lost in the blue
They don't love me like you do
Those chills that I knew
They were nothing without you
And everyone else
They don't matter now
You're the one I can't lose
  No one loves me like you do
Since I met you
All the gloomy days just seem to shine a little more brightly
Consider what we've got
'Cause I can never take you for granted
Is there another us on this whole planet?
Planet?
If you ever go, all the songs that we like
Will sound like bittersweet lullabies
Lost in the blue
They don't love me like you do

They were nothing without you

Her eyes blind with disappointment

O miénteme y dime que me quieres

Guccis en el closet, cien mil en una noche
La vida que querías; los Lambos y los Porsches
Y todo para que al final te hayas marcha'o

Die Schokoladenseite mancher Stadt
Schönes Lichtermeer am Funkeln
Nur eine kleine Eule ist noch wach
Sie genießt die leeren Straßen
Alles so schön ruhig und so still
Ja, wenn all die Spacken schlafen
Kann man tun und lassen was man will
Und immer wenn der Mond scheint
Dann is' Showtime
Dann is' Showtime
Dann kommt sie zum Vorschein
Denn das Tageslicht
Das mag sie nicht
Jedes Kind, das weiß doch
In der Ruhe liegt die Kraft
Und der allerbeste Treibstoff
Ist die Energie der Nacht
Tagsüber ist das Leben öde
Aber nachts hat sie die Stadt für sich allein
Nur noch ein paar andere schräge Vögel
Und zusammen haben sie 'ne wilde Zeit
Und immer wenn der Mond scheint
Dann is' Showtime
Dann is' Showtime
Dann kommt sie zum Vorschein
Denn das Tageslicht
Das mag sie nicht
Die Nacht verdreht ihr den Kopf
Nachts gehen die Käfige auf
Ab und zu läuft sie aus
Ab und zu fliegt sie gegen 'ne Faust
Trifft sich mit Kollegen, Ol Dirty Bussard, Spatzen, Tauben
Sieht paar Frankfurt Ultras mit großen Adleraugen
Am Tag sind die Straßen geteert, doch nachts sind sie auch noch gefedert
Verdammt sie ist Jäger, man trifft sie am Hafen
Ist süchtig nach Hasen und dreht sie am Drehblatt
Eine Nacht zwischen Wahrheit und Lügen
Eine Nacht zwischen Wohl oder Übel
Sie will einfach nur spielen
Hat kein Klavier, doch Red Bull verleiht Flügel
Vor über zehn Millionen Jahren
Hat die erste Eule mal gesagt:
„Ihr Spießer nehmt mal ruhig die Tage“
„Aber wir, wir nehmen die Nacht“
Und immer wenn der Mond scheint
Dann is' Showtime
Dann is' Showtime
Dann kommt sie zum Vorschein
Denn das Tageslicht
Das mag sie nicht

Tra le lenzuola perso come in mare
Perché ho sognato non ci fossi più
Ma ti ho trovato al mio fianco, sei qui ancora
E il tuo profumo che io adoro
Tu sei un’estate che non muore mai
Luce del sole quando scende giù
Correndo ci inseguiamo nel mondo
Ed intanto ci cresce attorno la poesia
Tu mi guardi e lasci che io sia, follia
E sulle labbra ogni goccia è nostalgia

Lei balla sul mio cuore come in ""Grease""
Fori nel mio petto, puoi guardarci dentro
Venire ad abitarci, cambiare arredamento
Far sbocciare i fiori nel mio appartamento
Puoi fare ciò che vuoi, tanto ormai ti appartengo
Sai, vorrei mostrarti una stanza di me
Dove non entra nessuno mai
E poi vedere se il mondo si accorge che noi
Non usciamo più

Puoi bussare con le mani al centro del mio petto
Domandare se magari c'è qualcuno qui dentro
Fuori è buio pesto e il mondo fa spavento, ti viene da perderti
Puoi fermare il tempo, se ti serve un tetto, passare la notte qui

But blacked out, so they won’t see her in it
Bussdown, baby ain’t tired of this
Diamonds, baby bought all of them
Dressed up and she just walks right in
Bussdown baby are you tired of this
Run it run it now, you want to head out
The flight leaves at noon and she want to buy chanel
Just dropped them 2 bags, they want another
Now you’re asking for too much
Order what you like, don’t have to pay her back
The parties at midnight, she’s wants an ounce of that
Feels so bad to feel nice, but she can’t handle that
It comes with with small price
Yeah, I give I give I give you take
Been keeping track like i’m a train
Even with drip i’m feeling drained
It’s getting long here like braids
Two sides, either really rude or too nice
So before it goes left you better move right
The top down cus she worked hard for it
But blacked out, so they won’t see her in it
Bussdown, baby ain’t tired of this
Diamonds, baby bought all of them
Dressed up and she just walks right in
Bussdown baby are you tired of this
 I give I give I give again
Show me the play if it’s a game
If there’s no point then what’s the aim
It’s like your eating off my name
Again again, the price of fame is really costing me
Spend again again; nothing in this life comes for free
They say that talk is cheap, furthermore it’s free
 If i go broke today will you stay or leave
 I fell so hard so deep wore my heart up on my sleeve
 Every word you say I just believe
So call me miss naive
The top down cus she worked hard for it
But blacked out, so they won’t see her in it
Bussdown, baby ain’t tired of this
Diamonds, baby bought all of them
Dressed up and she just walks right in
Bussdown baby are you tired of this
 Bussdown bussdown bussdown bussdown baby
 Come round come round come round come round save me
 Been round been round been up and down lately
Been up and down lately
They call me miss naive, miss naive
So trusting of everybody and anybody
Now they fear a bitch like me cuz of the bitch I be
I told you to be careful of me, be careful hunny, mh
They call me miss naive, I’m still naive
I put trust in the all ones that got me
They never really had me
See if you can’t fuck with me
Be real with me, you got to be
Careful of me, careful hunny
 (But you see. You no know say ah how be stay)
(Be no eat from nobody)
(Me no eat from.... Me never eat from nobody)

After all this time I thought that I knew
You and I was no debatin'
Now it's up for conversation
Tell me was it all a lie? I'm confused, hmm
But then you say what I wanna hear
'Cause you know it's gon' get me here
Every time I say that I'm through
And even though I know it ain't right
Said I wasn't gon' spend the night
Here I am right back with you
Although I've lost you
I, I'll always want you

When you hold me I forget to

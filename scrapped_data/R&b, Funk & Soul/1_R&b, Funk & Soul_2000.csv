0,Make You Feel My Love,Adele,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/adele/make-you-feel-my-love-chords-752102,"  When the rain is blowing in your face
  And the whole world is on your case
  I could offer you a warm embrace
  To make you feel my love
  When evening shadows and the stars appear
  And there is no one there to dry your tears
  I could hold you for a million years
  To make you feel my love
  I know you haven't made your mind up yet
  But I would never do you wrong
  I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong
  I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
  I'd go crawling down the avenue
  No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
  To make you feel my love
  The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
  And on the highway of regret
  The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
  There’s nothing that I would not do
  Go to the ends of the earth for you
  To make you feel my love
  To make you feel my love

1,Back To Black,Amy Winehouse,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/amy-winehouse/back-to-black-chords-467281," He left no time to re-gret,
Kept his dick wet, with his same old safe bet.
 Me... and my head high,
And my tears dry; get on without my guy.
 You went back to what you knew,
So far removed, from all that we went through.
And I... tread a troubled track,
My odds are stacked; I'll go back to black.
 We only said goodbye with words; I died a hundred times.
 You go back to her and I go back to...I go back to us.
 I love you much,
It's not e-nough; you love blow and I love puff.
And life is like a pipe,
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside.
 We only said goodbye with words; I died a hundred times.
 You go back to her and I go back to...
 We only said goodbye with words; I died a hundred times.
 You go back to her and I go back to...
 Black... black,
 Black... black.
 Black... black,
 Black... I go back to... I go back to...
 We only said goodbye with words; I died a hundred times.
 You go back to her and I go back to...
 We only said goodbye with words; I died a hundred times.
 You go back to her and I go back to black.

There was something so pleasant about that place.
In so much space
And when you're out there, without care,
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy??
Does that make me crazy???
Possibly.
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice
Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you are,
Ha ha ha bless your soul
You really think you're in control
Well, I think you're crazy!
I think you're crazy!
I think you're crazy,
Just like me.
  My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember is thinking, I wanna be like them
  Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably

Little girls double-dutch on the concrete
Maybe sometimes, we've got it wrong, but it's alright
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,
Just go ahead, let your hair down
     You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow
Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely,
Sipping tea in a bar by the roadside,
(just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you,
Got to love that afro hair do
Maybe sometimes, we feel afraid, but it's alright
The more you stay the same, the more they seem to change
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favourite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams,
Just go ahead, let your hair down
     You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow
'Twas more than I could take, pity for pity's sake
Some nights kept me awake, I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realise, that you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to

Your rolled up sleeves in your skull t-shirt

Cause you're my fella, my guy
Hand me your stella and fly
By the time I'm out the door
You tear men down like Roger Moore
I cheated myself like I knew I would
I told ya I was trouble, you know that I'm no good
Upstairs in bed with my ex boy
He's in a place but I can't get joy
Thinking on you in the final throes
This is when my buzzer goes
Run out to meet your chips and pitta
You say, “When we're married,” cause you're not bitter
There'll be none of him no more
I cried for you on the kitchen floor
I cheated myself like I knew I would
I told ya I was trouble, you know that I'm no good
Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we were again
I'm in the tub, you on the seat
Lick your lips as I soak my feet
Then you notice little carpet burn
My stomach drops and my guts churn
You shrug and it's the worst
Who truly stuck the knife in first

And this regret I got ac-customed to.
 Once it was so right, when we were at our high,
 Waiting for you in the ho-tel at night.
I knew I hadn't met my match, but every moment we could snatch.
I don't know why I got so attached.
It's my responsibility, and you don't owe nothing to me,
But to walk away; I have no ca-pacity.
 He walks a-way; the sun goes down.
 He takes the day, but I'm grown.
And in your grey, in this blue shade,
My tears dry on their own.
 I don't understand; why do I stress a man,
When there's so many better things at hand?
We could a never had it all; we had to hit a wall,
So this is in-evita-ble withdrawal.
Even if I stop wanting you, a per-spective pushes through,
I'll be some next man's other woman soon.
I can't play myself again, I should just be my own best friend,
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men.
 He walks a-way; the sun goes down.
 He takes the day, but I'm grown.
And in your grey, in this blue shade,

So we are history; your shadow covers me, the sky above, a blaze...
 He    walks away; the sun goes down.
 He takes the day, but I'm grown.
And in your grey, in this blue shade, my tears dry on their own.
I wish I could say no regrets, and no e-motional debts,

The sky above a blaze that only lovers see.

This ain't the honeymoon
Past the infatuation phase.
Right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue every day.
I know I misbehave and you made your mistakes and we both still got room left to grow.  
And though love sometimes hurt, I still put you first and we'll make this thing work but I
 think we should take it slow.
We're Just Ordinary People
We don't know which way 2 go
Cause we're Ordinary People
maybe we should take it slow.
Take it slow-oh oh-oh-oh
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow-oh oh-oh-oh

No fairy tale conclusion ya'll
It gets more confusing every day.
Sometimes it's heaven sent
Then we, head back to hell again
We kiss, then we make up all the way.
I hang up, you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just like walking away.
As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I still want you to stay...
We're Just Ordinary People
We don't know which way 2 go
Cause we're Ordinary People
maybe we should take it slow.
Take it slow-oh oh-oh-oh
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow-oh oh-oh-oh
This time we'll take it slow
Maybe we'll live and learn, maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay, maybe you'll leave, maybe you'll return
Maybe another fight, maybe we won't survive
Maybe we'll grow, we never know, baby you and I

Searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that one
Really loves my company
He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
But clouds are rollin' in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy
With some other guy
   I don't wanna do this anymore
   I don't wanna be the reason why
Everytime I walk out the door
 I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
   I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be...
A murderer
I feel it in the air
As I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Accepts i'm gonna be out late
I say I won't belong
Just hangin' with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy
With some other guy
   I don't wanna do this anymore
   I don't wanna be the reason why
Everytime I walk out the door
 I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
   I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be...
A murderer
Our love
His trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this
Anymore,    whoah..,     anymore

   I don't wanna be the reason why

To re-gret.
Kept his dick wet,
Safe bet.
 Me,
And my head high,
And my tears dry,
Get on without my guy.
 You went back,
To what you knew,
So far removed from,
All that we went through.
And I tread,
A troubled track,
My odds are stacked,
I'll go back to black.
 We only said good-bye,
With words,
 You go back to her
And I go back to...
 I go back to us.
 I love you much,
It's not e-nough.
And I love puff.
And life is like,
 A pipe,
And I'm a tiny penny,
The walls inside.
 We only said good-bye,
With words,
 You go back to her
And I go back to...
 We only said good-bye,
With words,
 You go back to her
And I go back to...
 Black,
 Black,

Just like oil on my hands,

Still I wonder why it is,

We do it all the time,
Blowing out my mind,
You've got this look I can't describe,
You make me feel like I'm alive,
When everything else is au fait,
Without a doubt you're on my side,
Heaven has been away too long,
Can't find the words to write this song,
Oh...Your love,
Still I wonder why it is,
I don't argue like this,
We do it all the time,
Blowing out my mind,
Now I have come to understand,
The way it is,
It's not a secret anymore,
'cause we've been through that before,
From tonight I know that you're the only one,
I've been confused and in the dark,
Now I understand,
I wonder why it is,
I don't argue like this,
I wonder why it is,

Once or twice was enough And it was all in vain
Time starts to pass Before you know it you’re frozen
But something happened For the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground Found something true
And everyone’s looking round Thinking I’m going crazy
But I don’t care what they say I’m in love with you
They try to pull me away But they don’t know the truth

Dieser Weg wird kein Leichter sein, dieser Weg wird steinig und schwer, 
nicht mit Vielem wirst du dir einig sein, doch dieses Leben bietet so viel mehr

danach ging ich einen kleinen Schritt und dann wurde es mir klar...

manche lieben dich ,
manche geben sich für Dich auf,
manche segnen Dich ,

But once your picture becomes tainted
It's what they call
The rise and fall
I always said that I was gonna make it
Now it's plain for everyone to see
But this game I'm in don't take no prisoners
Just casualties
I know that everything is gonna change
Even the friends I knew before may go
But this dream is the life I've been searching for
Started believing that I was the greatest
My life was never gonna be the same
Cause with the money came a different status
That's when things change
Now I'm too concerned with all the things I own
Blinded by all the pretty girls I see
I'm beginning to lose my integrity

But once your picture becomes tainted
It's what they call
The rise and fall
I never used to be a troublemaker
Now I don't even wanna please the fans
No autographs, no interviews, no pictures
Endless demands
Given advice that was clearly wrong
The type that seems to make me feel so right
But some things you may find can take over your life
Burnt all my bridges, now I've run out of places
And there's nowhere left for me to turn
Been caught in compromising situations
I should have learned
From all those times I didn't walk away
When I knew that it was best to go
Is it too late to show you the shape of my heart?
Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over

whithout anyone when you keep crying out
to this day but nobody comes
and you feel so far away
then you just cant find your way home
you can get there alone it's ok wont you stay
i can make it through the rain
i can stand up once again
oh my own, and i know
that im strong enough to mind
and everything i feel to pray
i hold tighter to my faith
and i live one more day
and make it through the rain
and when the wind blows
and shadow grow close dpnt be afraid
there's nothing you cant face
youll never go through

And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you’re all on your own
You can say I chose to be alone

It's harder when you’re on top
Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love
Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you’re at your worst
You know how to feel things
Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired
There ain't no room in my bed as far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love
Go ahead and still my heart to make me cry again
Cause it will never hurt as much as it did then
When we were both right and no one had blame
But now I give up on this endless game
Cause who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong

I would really take you back 
Let you back in my heart one more time, oh no, no... 
Did you think that I?d still care 
That there?d be more feeling there 
Did you think you could walk back in my life 
So you found you miss the love you threw away 
Baby, but you found it out too late... to late 
And so now you know the way it feels to cry 
The way tat I cried when you broke may world in two 
Baby, I learned the way to break a heart 
I learned from the best, I learned from you 
Oh, baby, now I learned from you 
So when all you?re got are sleepless nights 
When those tears are clouding up your eyes 
Just remember it was you who said goodbye 
Who said goodbye

To hear sleigh bells in the snow

May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

  All seven and we will watch them fall
They stand in the way of love and we will smoke them all

And every evil soul will surely die in spite
of  their 7 tears, but do not fear
For in the distance, 12 souls from now
You and me will still be here
We will still be here
There will be a new city with the streets

There will be no death, for every breath

5,Heal The World (ver 5),Michael Jackson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/michael-jackson/heal-the-world-chords-1742901,"There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much brighter
Than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel
There's no hurt or sorrow
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong it only cares for joyful giving
If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear or dread we stop existing and start living
Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
Make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
And the dream we were conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth crucify this soul
Though it's plain to see, this world is heavenly
Be  God's glow
We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares
We can really get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
There are people dying

Here is my   hand  for   you   to  hold
Here’s the part of me   they  have  not sold
I’ve wan-dered far,  I’ve  had   my  fill
I     need  you    now; do you love  me  still?
The hidden part of me
Call me fool-har-  dy    if    you will
I     loved you  when; do you love  me  still?
    So man-y       smiles and lies        surround me
    Emp-ty      ex-  pectations, faceless fears
       Some-times this life       is a bit-  ter pill
I     love  you    now; do you love  me  still?
You  have been mine  since time  un- told
Our  love is  im-mor- tal,  don’t you know
Oth- ers will come, and they will go
But I     loved you    young, I     love  you old
The other side of me
Call me na-  ïve,  I     think you will
But I     loved you  then; do you love  me  still?
    Here are the     eyes that on-ly see you
    Here is the     mouth that only calls your name
       Here is the soul        that can-  not kill
I     love  you    now; do you love  me  still?

And yes you say, So     must the day
Too, fade away
And leave a ray of sun

Yet filled with sorrow and  compassion

All things that happen
Will age too old
Though gold, Gold,  Gold, Gold
Though gold.

And all you want to do
Is to cry out loud

No way no one
No one understands

When just a touch of love is all the problem needed
And when you hurt someone so much that still they die loving you

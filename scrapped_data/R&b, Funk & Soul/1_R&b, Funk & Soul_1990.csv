0,Killing Me Softly,Fugees,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/fugees/killing-me-softly-chords-50470,"Strumming my pain with his fingers.  Singing my life with his words.
Killing me softly with his song.  Killing me softly with his song.
Telling my whole life with his words.
Killing me softly,  with his song.
I heard he sang a good song.
I heard he had a style.
And so I came to see him,
and listen for a while.
And there he was this young boy,
a stranger to my eyes.
Strumming my pain with his fingers.  Singing my life with his words.
Killing me softly with his song. Killing me softly with his song.
Telling my whole life with his words.
Killing me softly,  with his song.
I felt all flushed with fever,
embarrassed by the crowd.
I felt he found my letters
and read each one out loud.
I prayed that he would finish,
but he just kept right on.
Strumming my pain with his fingers.  Singing my life with his words.
Killing me softly with his song.  Killing me softly with his song.
Telling my whole life with his words.
Killing me softly,  with his song.
Strumming my pain with his fingers.  Singing my life with his words.
Killing me softly with his song.  Killing me softly with his song.
Telling my whole life with his words.
Killing me softly,  with his song.

Duba dabu dubiduu...
  There used to be a greying tower alone on the sea
You became the light on the dark side of me 
But love remains a drug that´s the high not the pill
But did you know that when it snows,
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen
Baby I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
Ooh, the more I get of you the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom
A light hits the gloom on the grey
Duba dabu dubiduu...
  There is so much a man can tell you so much he can say
You remain my power, my pleasure, my pain, baby,
to me you´re like a growing addiction that I can´t deny
Won´t you tell me is that healthy baby
But did you know that when it snows,
My eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen
Baby I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
Ooh, the more I get of you the stranger it feels, yeah
And now that your rose is in bloom

Because I'll never change all my colors for you
Take my love, I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are and everything that you do
I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
Can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide
But don't make me close one more door
I don't wanna hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you
You see through, right to the heart of me
You break down my walls with the strength of your love
I never knew love like I've known it with you
Will a memory survive, one I can hold on to
I don't really need to look very much further
I don't wanna have to go where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again, this passion inside
Can't run from myself, there's nowhere to hide
Your love I'll remember forever

3,When You Believe,Mariah Carey,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/mariah-carey/when-you-believe-chords-589585,"Many nights we've prayed, with no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song we barely understood
Now we are not afraid, although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains long before we knew we could
There can be miracles, when you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will,  you will when you believe
In this time of fear, when prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seemed like the summer birds too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here, my heart's so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words I never thought I'd say
There can be miracles, when you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will,  you will when you believe
They don’t always happen when you ask
And it’s easy to give in to your fear
But when you’re blinded by your pain
Can’t see your way safe through the rain
Thought of a still resilient voice
Says love is very near
There can be miracles, when you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will, now you will
You will when you believe
You will when you believe

What we're living in,     let me tell ya
It's a wonder man can eat at all
When things are big that should be small
Who can tell what magic spells
Will be doing for us?
And I'm giving all my love to this world
   Only to be told
I can't see, I can't breathe,
no more will we be
And nothing's going to change the way we live
Cos' we can always take but never give
An' now that things're changing for the worse, see

Hard to know where to begin
If I could slip the sickly ties
That earthly   man has made
And now every mother can choose the colour
     Of her child,   that's not nature's way
Well that's what they said yesterday
There's nothing left to do but pray
I think it's time I found a new  eligion,  wo  - ah,
it's so insane to synthesize another strain
There's something in these futures that we have  to be told
  Futures made of virtu - al    insani  - ty now
  Always seem to be governed by this love we have for
  Useless, twisting of the new techno - logy
  Oh, now there is no sound, for we all live under - ground

How could this be? You're not here with me.
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why,
Did you have to go, and leave my world so cold?
Everyday I sit and ask myself : How did love slip away ?
Something whispers in my ear and says that...
You are not alone, for I am here with you.
Though you're far away, I am here to stay.
But you are not alone, for I am here with you,
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart,
But you are not alone.
No...
'Lone, why?
'Lone...
Just the other night I thought I heard you cry,
Asking me to come, and hold you in my arms.
I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear,
But first I need your hand, then forever can begin.
Everyday I sit and ask myself : How did love slip away ?
Something whispers in my ear and says that...
You are not alone, for I am here with you.
Though you're far away, I am here to stay.
But you are not alone, for I am here with you,
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart,
You are not alone, for I am here with you.

Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
   But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter, listen to me
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
  Little precious has a natural obsession
For temptation but he just can't see
  She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is ""baby it's good to me""
  One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
  His health is fading and he doesn't know why
3 letters took him to his final resting place, y'all don't hear me?
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast    c'mon
  I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms have come and gone
Leavin' a trace of not one God-given ray, is it because my life is ten shades of gray?
I pray all ten fade away Seldom praise Him for the sunny days
  And like His promise is true only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew, to bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies, have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
My only bleedin' hope, is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
  Who's to blame for tootin' 'caine into your own vein?
  What a shame you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane and name this day in time for fallin' prey
to crime I say the system got you victim to your own mind
  Dreams are hopeless aspirations
In hopes of comin' true believe in yourself the rest is up to me and you
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

And I know that it is love
And this place could be much
Brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel
There's no hurt or sorrow
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong it only cares for joyful giving
If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear or dread we stop existing
And start living
Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
Make a better world
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth crucify this soul
Though it's plain to see
Be God's glow
We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords
Into plowshares
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place

 Hold on there will be tomorrow
In time you'll find the way

and read each one out loud.
I prayed that he would finish
but he just kept right on.
Strumming my pain with his fingers
singing my life with his words
killing me softly with his song
killing me softly with his song
telling my whole life with his words.
Killing me softly
with his song.
He sang as if he knew me
in all my dark despair.
And then he looked right through me
as if I wasn't there.
And he just kept on singing
singing clear and strong.
Strumming my pain with his fingers
singing my life with his words
killing me softly with his song
killing me softly with his song
telling my whole life with his words.
Killing me softly
with his song.

No I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way
the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes it shows
No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there but then I
let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know
I can't live, if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live, if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give anymore
Well I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way
the story goes
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes it shows
I can't live, if living is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live, if living is without you
I can't give, I can't give anymore

48,Kahit Kailan,South Border,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/south-border/kahit-kailan-chords-440265,"  Nagtatanong ang isip
  Di raw maintindihan
Kung anong nararamdaman
  Dapat mong malaman
  Sa puso ko'y ikaw lamang
Ang nag iisa...
Pangangamba
  Dapat bang isipin
Walang hanggan
Asahan mo na...
Kahit kalian
Di kita iiwan
Kahit kalian
Di kita pababayaan
Kahit kalian
Kahit kailan...
  Bulong ng yung damdamin
  Pagibig na walang hanggan
Ang siyang nais kong makamtan
  Ngayon ay narito ako
  Handang umibig sa iyo
Na walang katapusan...
Pangangamba
  Dapat bang isipin?
Walang hanggan
Asahan mo na...
Kahit kalian
Di kita iiwan
Kahit kalian
Di kita pababayaan
Kahit kalian
Kahit kailan...
Kung ikaw ay mawala sa piling ko
Di na alam kung kakayanin pa kayang
Umibig pang muli
Kahit na ano pang mangyayari
Di maaring ipag-balik
Sasamahan pa kita
Hanggang sa huli..........ahh….
Kahit kalian
Di kita iiwan
Kahit kalian
Di kita pababayaan
Kahit kalian
Di magbabago
Kahit kalian
Kahit kailan...

but it's caused me to act in such a crazy way
Whatever it is that you do when you do what you're doing
it's a feeling I don't understand
Cause my heart starts beating triple time,
with thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do,
when the cause and cure is you
I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes over me
In a daze and it's so amazing, it's not a phase
I want you to stay with me, by my side
I swallow my pride, your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
I can't  explain why your loving makes me weak
It's Time after time after time I've tried to fight it
But your love is strong it keeps on holding on
Resistance is down when you're around, starts fading
In my condition I don't want to be alone
'Cause my heart starts beating triple time,
with thoughts of loving you on my mind
I can't figure out just what to do,
when the cause and cure is you
I get so weak in the knees I can hardly speak
I lose all control and something takes over me
In a daze and it's so amazing, it's not a phase
I want you to stay with me, by my side
I swallow my pride, your love is so sweet
It knocks me right off of my feet
I can't  explain why your loving makes me weak
       I try hard to fight it
       No way can I deny it
       Your love's so sweet
       It knocks me off my feet

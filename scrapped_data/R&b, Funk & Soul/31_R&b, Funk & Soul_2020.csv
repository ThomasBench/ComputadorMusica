I keep it in to spare you
 If I could turn back time
 What am I to do?
Keepin' pushing on and pray it leads me back to you
Survivor-less objective but the love is never true
Fall in love with life and then you fall in love with you
I thought serotonin is the one
The apple of my eye and the ignitor of the fun
You stab me in the back when you should stab me in the front

Oh, you know I miss you, not afraid to admit it
Said you needed time, but you know I wasn't with it
But we both know more time just mean you fuckin' more bitches
Now that's none of my business
In my emotions
Goin' through these photos while I go through the motions
Goin' through these texts so I can live in the moments
Never havin' closure is the reason I'm open
Maybe I'm hopin'
Times are different
That's not why you distant
Tell me different
On my mind, on my mind
Can't get it off my mind
On my mind, on my mind
Can't get it off my mind
I know I'm out, but somehow I'm still in it
Just know I feel a way 'cause I know you still feel it
And in my mind, it ain't over though it's ovеr
Oh, no
I was gonna hit you, but I'm glad I ain't send it
'Cause now I hеar you talkin' shit about how we ended
Everything I said and done, you know that I meant it
Yes, you know that I meant it
Say what you won't say 'cause I feel the same way
  Say what you won't say, doesn't matter anyways, no
Times are different
That's not why you distant
Tell me different
On my mind, on my mind
Can't get it off my mind
On my mind, on my mind
Can't get it off my mind
I know I'm out, but somehow I'm still in it
Just know I feel a way 'cause I know you still feel it
And in my mind, it ain't over though it's ovеr
Oh, no
If I could, then I would see you
Underwater, I would breathe you
If I did not, I would still need you
If it was possible to be you
I would, girl, I would lead you
Away from all the evil, all these people
I would treat you like you're me, too
Like I need you (My)

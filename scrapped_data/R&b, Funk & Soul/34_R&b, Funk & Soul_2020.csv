That always gets me back on top
I’ve been tryna think of all your negatives
But I can’t think of one
Then I’ll go and line up all your benefits
And they stretch around the sun
‘Cause I hear music when you’re next to me
There’s a sweetness in the air I breathe
And you put me      at    ease
Every time you’re touching me
It’s your love
That always gets me back on top
And it’s your love
That always makes me feel enough (Feel enough)
And I knew on thе day I met you,
that you would save my life
It’s your lovе
That always gets me back on top
   One step closer to you
Is one less moment feeling blue (Oh, oh)
   One second more with you
I could light up the entire room
‘Cause I’m in sunshine when you’re next to me
And all the birds sing in harmony
You put me     at    ease
Every time you’re touching me
It’s your love
That always gets me back on top
And it’s your love
That always makes me feel enough (Feel enough)
And I knew on the day I met you,
that you would save my life
It’s your love
That always gets me back on top
Just like a rocket into outer space
I go from lower into upper case
And if you’re standing at the finish line
Then I will always come in first place
And I swear, I’m walking on air
It’s your love
That always gets me back on top
And it’s your love
That always makes me feel enough (That always makes me feel enough)
And I knew on the day I met you,
that you would save my life
It’s your love
(Oh baby, yeah, yeah it’s your love)
It’s your love
That always gets me back  on  top

1,Sober,Kimberose,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/kimberose/sober-chords-3919448,"Gone, guess that good old feeling's strong
Should've know that you were wrong for me
Wrong for me, wrong for me, wrong
Now that I'm sober
My temperature's a little colder
I see it clearly now, I only fell for you
'Cause I was young and dumb and broken
I hate being sober
My hands are shaking and my nights are lonely
I put my body and my soul through hell for you
Why does it hurt that it's over?
I've been drunk
For three years and fifteen days
Off that perfume that you wear
And that good look on your face
I ignored all my worst fears
And now the liquor won't chase
The thought of you from my head
My mouth still stinks from the taste of it
Now that I'm sober
My temperature's a little colder
I see it clearly now, I only fell for you
'Cause I was young and dumb and broken
I hate being sober
My hands are shaking and my nights are lonely
I put my body and my soul through hell for you
Why does it hurt that it's over?
Don't know why I'm still crying
It's not like you're wide awake
Why am I tossing back whiskey?
I should be popping champagne
I won't swallow my pride 'cause I know what I gave
Why should I poison myself
To try to fix your mistakes?
Now that I'm sober
My temperature's a little colder
I see it clearly now, I only fell for you
'Cause I was young and dumb and broken

You look different in the sun

But am I the only one
Who wonders still about your days?
Did you find your sense of peace? Lord, please
I hope you've forgiven me
Couldn't see you drowning
Sacrificed your sanity
Stole my silver lining
But we're older now, what happened to the days
We've been running out of time
Just like the leaves back east, we'll change
But eventually we'll find our way back home
But will we be alone?
There was a time your smile
Lit the city up for miles
But you lost it in the battle
That you fought for me, my angel
I could spend the rest of my life
Trying to give you back to the light
Even if that means, I'm dead to you, you're dead to me
Well, rest in peace, to us, a tragedy, I guess
You left, a casket full of dust
I'll scatter the ashes in my the wasteland of my selfishness
I can feel you forgetting me, well, do it
I'll still love you for getting me, through this, I don't care

Nah, when I called you out your name
That was my ego my pride and pain
I should be a movie star the way I play the part like everything’s ok
Oh now I try to be the life of the party
All night buying shots for everybody
But it’s all just an act
Cuz I can’t have you back
Without you I been going crazy
Tryna put on a smile (put on a smile)
Tryna fight these tears from cryin
But lord knows I’m dyin dyin
Tryna put on a smile (put on a smile)
Out here smiling like a fool
When the only thing worth smiling for
Baby girl the only thing worth smiling for was
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
If I could turn back the hands on my Rolly you know I would
I would have spent all my time making sure that my baby good
I’m trying hard to hide the shame
I know I’m playing a dangerous game
But since you been gone I aint been the same
There’s only so much a man can fake
Oh now I try to be the life of the party
All night buying shots for everybody
But it’s all just an act
Cuz I can’t have you back
Without you I been going crazy
Tryna put on a smile (put on a smile)
Tryna fight these tears from cryin
But lord knows I’m dyin dyin
Tryna put on a smile (put on a smile)
Baby, out here smiling like a fool
When the only thing worth smiling for
Baby girl the only thing worth smiling for
When the only thing worth smiling for
Baby girl the only thing worth smiling for
Was      you,

I’m tryna put on a smile (put on a smile)
Tryna fight these tears from cryin

I'm falling again, I think I need a friend
I'm feeling strange in a foreign land
Let's meet in France a week after you land
Cycle again like a whirlwind
Don't walk away, you know I'm needing you to stay
See me reaching out, I haven't turned the other way
Keep me warm again, I'm better within than without
But I gotta know, are you letting go?
Don't walk away, you know I'm needing you to stay
See me reaching out, I haven't turned the other way
Keep me warm again, I'm bettеr within than without
But I gotta know, are you letting go?
Are you lеtting go?
Are you even close?
Are you letting go?
Are you even, even?
Better share, I better share my mind now
I don't want you thinking I'm a cop-out
Happens every time, I guess I tried though
Tried to stay in line but slipped and fell over
I wonder how long it'll take to burn out
Get sick of me and go and find a nice girl
I'm wasting all your time, so indecisive
But I will stay if that is what you want, babe
 Don't walk away, you know I'm needing you to stay
See me reaching out, I haven't turned the other way
Keep me warm again, I'm better within than without
But I gotta know, are you letting go?
Don't walk away, you know I'm needing you to stay

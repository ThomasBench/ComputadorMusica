Sometimes it's there in the way you say hello
Sometimes the answer is yes when you say no

way back when we were friends
going together but then you left me.
Frankie,    do you remember me?
Frankie,    do you remember?
You were fifteen, I was twelve,
it was summer, we were so in love.
I never loved anyone this much
Look at me I'm thrilled to your touch.

I could leave you, and go wandering on my own, or believe in you, never leave you all alone
Weave your spell for one more day, You enchanted me to stay
When you met me I was wild, ""The Spider and the Fly"", your affections made me smile, I didn't have to try
But then you tamed me, never blamed me for my pride, and you aimed to, find the real me deep inside
Weave your spell for one more day, You enchanted me to stay

Seems so long ago
You were standing on the quay
And you blew a kiss to me

The ship began to pull away
Then I heard a stranger say
It's sad to see true lovers part

Out of sight and out of mind
Well the stranger's words came true
And the prophecy went through
I knew it would change my world

A whispered conversation
I overheard
I asked you what was going on
You said that I'd been gone too long
And the rain that fell in West Berlin
Was nothing like the rain that fell within

Oh, Regine, here am I
So far away
Out of sight, out of mind

Day after day
I will take what love I find
So I made some other plans
Took my life in these two hands
And I know I won't turn around
Though I often see your face
When I'm in a crowded place
It doesn't get me down
I met a girl with smiling eyes
Full of love and worldly wise
She told me she knows what to do
To help me put the memories of you

Sometimes we don't even know, what we're fighting for
Marching to the beat of their drum
Leaders we no longer trust, told too many lies
The promises they made to us, were never rea-lised
Hear me now the chant has begun
Nowhere left to turn, no-one left to turn to, voices raised in anger
They don't have the answer, our whole world's in danger
Oil slicks on the ebbing tide, progress out of hand
Blind men choke on swallowed pride, heads down in the sand
Don't wanna see the damage they've done
Trees destroyed by acid rain, falling from the skies
When our children place the blame, who will tell them why
Hear me now the chant has begun
Why is love so rare, all this talk of warfare, too much blind destruction
Follow love's instructions, now the chant has begun

A woman sensi-tive and warm, and that you were.
With pride and strength no one would test,
But yet have femi-nine fi-nesse, and so much more.
You took me riding in your rocket; gave me a star.
You dropped me back down to this cold, cold world.
You took me riding in your rocket; gave me a star.
You dropped me back down to this cold, cold world.
A female Shakespeare of your time,
With looks to blow Pi-casso's mind; you were the best.
Your body moved with grace and song,
Like sympho-nies by Bach or Brahms, neverthe-less.            Oh, oh;
You took me riding in your rocket; gave me a star.
You dropped me back down to this cold, cold world.
You took me riding in your rocket; gave me a star.
You dropped me back down to this cold, cold world.
Do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do,
Do do do, do do do,
The passion burning in your heart,
Would make hell's fire seem like a spark; where did it go?
Just why that you would over-night,
Turn love to stone as cold as ice, I'll never  know.
You took me riding in your rocket; gave me a star.
You dropped me back down to this cold, cold world.
You took me riding in your rocket; gave me a star.
You dropped me back down to this cold, cold world. Cold, too cold.

Lost at sea, hot in the desert
Stay with me, you won't regret it
Take this love, so deep to swim in
Come to me, and let my love in

water in the milk from a hole in the roof where the rain came through.
What can you do? Ahah.
Tears from your little sister, crying because she doesn't have a dress
without a patch for the party to go.
But you know, she'll get by.
Cause she's living in the love of the common people,
smiles from the heart of a family man.
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to,
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can. And she can.
It's a good thing you don't have bus fare.                                                                
and you'd lose it in the snow on the ground.
You gotta walk into town, to find a job.
Trying to keep your hands warm,                                                                
and chill you to the bone.
So now you better go home where it's warm.
Where you can live in the love of the common people,
smiles from the heart of a family man.
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to,
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can. And she can.
(eight bars)
Living on a dream ain't easy.
But the closer the knit, the tighter the fit, and the chills stay away.
Just take them in stride for family pride.
You know that faith is your foundation with a whole lotta love
and a warm conversation, but don't forget to pray.
Just making it strong, where you belong.
And we're living in the love of the common people,
smiles from the heart of a family man.
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to,
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can. And she can.
Yes we're living in the love of the common people,
smiles from the heart of a family man.
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to,
Mama's gonna love you just as much as she can. 
living in the love of the common people,

Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to,

Have better things to do

About folks like me and you
With hearts to break in two

Another line about goodbye
And everyone will see me crying
Oh no hear comes a lonely tear drop
Once they start you know they'll never stop
It all reminds me that you're so on
On no not another heart song
I know we got a heaven
Those songs about love and tears
But why can't they just find their way
Till someone else is here
Really heard the way I do
Are they only cashing in
On how I'm missing you
Not another heart song
I fall apart when they come on
Another line about goodbye
And everyone will see me crying
Oh no hear comes a lonely tear drop
Once they start you know they'll never stop
It all reminds me that you're so on
On no not another heart song

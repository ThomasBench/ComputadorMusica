I can sing all night long...
I can play with the band until you hear my song...
'Cause I'm full of fire (full of fire... full of fire)
See the party lights....
Baby I'm full of fire (full of fire... full of fire)
Its the reason why...
I can dance with the fire...
Burnin'.... burnin' low...
I can stay 'til the party is all over...
Baby I'm full of fire (full of fire... full of fire)
I rolled a twenty one...
Baby I'm full of fire (full of fire full of fire)...
Life has just begun...
Ooo Ooo I can dance to the music...
I can under... understand that there must be a power that I hold in my hands...
Dance... dance... dance...

I understand...
There's some things that I know...
But I want the horns to blow...

I want you all to myself, I don't wanna share you with nobody else

How you can't forget that before we met those were the good old days
Why must you hurt me so? I can't stand it no more and I'm really trying

   And it's so terrible
   Don't you know if you want a good life
   Best look into yourself
   'Cause the world is cold and everybody's bold
   And there's no one else
   Time makes you suffer when seasons change

Now if we could get all the fathers of the world
To stand up and be fathers
That would be great
Then we have mothers
Who are the right arm of the father
There's supposed to-to-to do the cooking
Raise the children, do the sewing
And help the father to guide and direct
Then there's the son
The son, most sons are like imitators of their father
So we're back again to the father
And he is guiding in the right way
The son is definitely gonna be alright
Then we have the daughter
Watching her mother
Be-because sooner or later she's gonna be a mother
And she'll have her own sons and daughters
It don't, it don't just stop there with the family or
Of-of yours or mine
It's a universal family
Under one divine purpose
And one divine father
That is if we all come together no matter what color, race, creed
Because that's all in the head whether you wanna believe it or not

Scattered in the wind

Be easier    to say

Knowing the love of your our life
Will never come again

To give our love
Just one more try

Blow rockin' robin
Cause we're really gonna rock tonight
Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand
Told them how to do the bop and it was grand
They started going steady and-a bless my soul
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriol
    He rocks in the tree tops all day long
    Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song
    All the little birdies on Jaybird Street

Tired of movies, all by myself.
I'm sure, you folks know what I mean.
My time has come and I need someone.
To share my popcorn and jellybeans.
Looked in the mirror, it all got clearer.
I won't let, my life pass me by.
Stop feelin' sorry for myself.
Fish are biting, I'll throw out my line.

Must be careful and watch my step.
I hope the shock, is very mild.
I'll change my hair and change my style.
Watch out, I might just go wild.
I got to get out and live.
And show the world, how much I can give.
I'm gonna do it all by myself.
I'll make a love, you can put on a shelf.

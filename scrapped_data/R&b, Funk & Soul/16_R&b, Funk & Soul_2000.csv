Though she denies her pain and her dismay
Know I said this to her anyway

Ooh don't let real love pass you by

Cause you deserve so much more than you receive

Don't hold on to your pain Just let it go
let it go

From a lost mockingbird stuck up in a tree 
We got a lot going on

We're past the infatuation phase.
We're right in the thick of love.  At times we get sick of love.
It seems like we argue every day.
I know I've misbehaved and you've made your mistakes
and we've both still got room left to grow.
And though love sometimes hurts, I still put you first.
And we'll make this thing work but I think we should take it slow.
We're just ordinary people.  We don't know which way to go.
'cause we're ordinary people, maybe we should take it slow.
Take it slow, oh oh.  This time we'll take it slow.
Take it slow, oh oh.  This time we'll take it slow.
This ain't a movie, naw.  No fairy tale conclusion, y'all.
It gets more confusing every day.
Oh, sometimes it's heaven sent, then we head back to hell again.
We kiss then we make up on the way.
I hang up, you call.  We rise and we fall,
and we feel like just walking away.
But as our love advances, we take second chances.
Though it's not a fantasy, I still want you to stay.
We're just ordinary people.  We don't know which way to go.
'cause we're ordinary people, maybe we should take it slow.
Take it slow, oh oh.  This time we'll take it slow.
Take it slow, oh oh.  This time we'll take it slow.
Take it slow.
Maybe we'll live and learn.  Maybe we'll crash and burn.
Maybe you'll stay; maybe you'll leave; maybe you'll return.
Maybe another fight; maybe we won't survive;
But maybe we'll grow.  We never know, baby, you and I.
We're just ordinary people.  We don't know which way to go.

When my head is strong, but my heart is weak,
I'm full of arrogance and uncertainty
When I can't find the words, you teach my heart to speak,
You make it real for me
And Iiiiii'm running to you baby,
And yoooou are the only one who saves me
That's whyyyyy I've been missing you lately,
'Cause you make it real for me
  Everybody's talking in words I don't understand,
  You've got to be the only one who knows just who I am
  And you're shining in the distance,
  And I hope I can make it through
'Cause the only place that I want to be is right back home with you
I guess there's so much more I have to learn,
But if you're here with me, I know which way to turn
You always give me somewhere, somewhere I can run,
You make it real for me
And Iiiiii'm running to you baby,
And yoooou are the only one who saves me
That's whyyyyy I've been missing you lately,
'Cause you make it real for me

I know what I said
Was heat of the moment

   It’s a little late now to fix the heart thats broken
   Please don't ask me where I'm going
Cause I don't know
No I don't know anymore
It used to feel like heaven
Used to feel like may
I used to hear those violins playing heart strings like a symphony
Now they've gone away
Nobody wants to face the truth
But you wont believe what love can do
Till it happens to you
Went to the old flat
Guess I was trying to turn the clock back
How come that nothing feels the same now when I'm with you

When our love was new
Oooh love I'm a fool to believe in you

黑暗中專心聞妳的髮香
這夜晚  讓暗戀很有畫面感  回想
與妳約會過的地方  都捨不得刪
  在腦海裏儲存欣賞
 **妳微笑瀏覽  手機裏的浪漫
  原來真心送出愛是這麼簡單
  溫習螢幕上  妳可愛的模樣
  關於緣份的解釋我又多傳了一行
  妳微笑瀏覽  手機裏的浪漫
  原來愛情可以來的這麼突然
  短信的橋樑  將曖昧期拉長
  我們的感情蔓延滋長用文字培養  在虛擬土壤
電視牆  吵雜的情歌還在拼命播放
我安靜在鬧區等來電鈴響
有一些話打好了卻不敢傳
怕收到信息的妳在為難
街道上  人潮襯托我的孤單  想像
誰幸運的陪在妳身旁  卻誤會一場
  妳也在等妳手機響

0,Another Cup Of Coffee (ver 2),Mike + The Mechanics,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/mike-the-mechanics/another-cup-of-coffee-chords-1757352,"And she pours herself another cup of coffee
As she contemplates the stain across the wall
and it's in between the cleaning and the washing
That's when looking back's
The hardest part of all
And she always did her best to try and please him
While he always did his best to make her cry
And she got down on her knees to stop him leaving
But he always knew one day he'd say goodbye
Where are your friends
Where are your children
Is this your house
Is this your home
Does nothing ever last forever
Does everybody sleep alone
And he tears the business tags from his old suitcase
As he packs away the pieces of his life
They all love him but they always try to change him
That's what happens when a girl becomes a wife
And she pours herself another cup of coffee
As the pictures leave a clean space on the wall
and it's in between the leaving and the loving
That's when looking back's
The hardest part of all
Where are your friends
Where are your children
Is this your house
Is this your home
Does nothing ever last forever
Does everybody sleep alone
Don't look back
Don't give up
Pour yourself another cup
Don't look back
Don't give up
Pour yourself another cup

But we're not too sure where we've been
We've had success
We've had good times
But remember this
Been   on this path of life for so long
Feel I've walked a thousand miles
Sometimes strolled hand in hand with love
Everybody's been there
With danger on my mind I would stand on the line of hope
And I knew I could make it
Once I knew the boundaries I looked into the clouds and saw
My face in the moonlight
Just then I realised what a fool I could be
Just cause I looked so high I don't have to see me
Finding a paradise wasn't easy but still
There's a road going down the other side of this hill

Ne...ver pretend that it's all real
Some.day soon this will all be someone else's dream
This will be someone else's dream
Safe    from the arms of disappointment for so long
Feel each day we've come too far
Yet each day seems to make much more
Sure is good to be here
I understand the meaning of I can't explain this feeling now
And it feels so unreal
At night I see the hand that reminds me of the stand that I make
And the fact of reality

Heartache and pain.
I’ve been burned by the sunshine,
Been drowned in the pouring rain,
Had too many lovers
And not enough love.
I’ve been tried and convicted
Of things I’m not guilty of.
I was locked in a prison
‘Till you came and set me free.
So, how can you say,
You’re no good for me?
Now that the magic has gone,
You just wanna walk away,
Nothing left to say
Anyway.
Now that the magic has gone,
There’s no sense in holding on.
Baby now, now that the magic is gone.
You know love can be tender,
Love can be cruel,
It can smile like an angel
While it treats you just like a fool.
It captures and haunts you
Until you give in,
And it stacks the dice against you
In a game you never can win.
Just when I was thinking
Lady Luck was here with me,
You tell me, it’s over.
Say, it’s time for breaking free.
Now that the magic has gone,
You just wanna walk away,
Nothing left to say
Anyway, baby.
Now that the magic has gone,
There’s no sense in holding on.
Baby now, now that the magic is gone.
I won’t try to hold you down,
My mind tells me, let go,
But my heart keeps asking, how.
There’s no prizes for the loser,
Only the winner takes the purse.
Some say that love’s a blessing
But to me it’s just a curse.
Now that the magic has gone,
You just wanna walk away,
Nothing left to say
Anyway.
Now that the magic has gone,
There’s no sense in holding on.
Baby, now that the magic has gone.
Now that the magic has gone,
You just wanna walk away,
Nothing left to say.

Isn't she lovely? 
Isn't she wonderful?
Isn't she precious? 
Less than one minute old
But isn't she lovely; made from love?
Isn't she pretty?  
Truly the angel's best
Boy, I'm so happy
We have been Heaven blessed
But isn't she lovely; made from love?
Isn't she lovely? 
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name
That's so very lovely; made from love

1,Warm Love,Van Morrison,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/van-morrison/warm-love-chords-3020222,"Look at the ivy on the old clinging wall
Look at the flowers and the green grass so tall
It's not a matter of when push comes to shove
It's just the hour on the wings of a dove
That's just warm love
It's just warm love
I dig it when you're fancy, dressed up in lace
I dig it when you have a smile on your face
This inspiration's got to be on the flow
These invitation's got to see it and know
It's just warm love
It's just warm love
And it's ever present everywhere
And it's ever present everywhere
That warm love
And it's ever present everywhere
And it's ever present everywhere
That warm love
To the country I'm going
Lay and laugh in the sun
You can bring your guitar along
We'll sing some songs
And have some fu - u - un
The sky is cryin' and it's time to go home
And we shall hurry to the car from the foam
Sit by the fire and dry out our wet clothes
It's raining outside from the skies up above
Inside it's warm love
Inside it's warm love
And it's ever present everywhere
And it's ever present everywhere
That warm love
And it's ever present everywhere
And it's ever present everywhere
That warm love ( can't you feel it )
And it's ever present everywhere
And it's ever present everywhere
That warm love
And it's ever present everywhere
And it's ever present everywhere
That warm love
And it's ever present everywhere
And it's ever present everywhere

No non è possibile, improvvisamente no
 Il traffico che corre la gente nei caffè
La mente mia che scorre e indaga su di te
Le ultime espressioni le pause fra di noi
Le minime emozioni i gesti, gli occhi tuoi
Neanche un minuto    di ""non amore""
Questo è il risultato, dei pensieri miei!
Eppure qualcosa c'è impercettibile per me
Ma per te così importante lo sento è presente
Che grida e intanto grida un clackson dietro me
Sto odiando questa strada che mi separa da te

It may be factual, it may be cruel, I ain't lying
Everybody plays the fool

And your ability to reason, is swept away
Oh, heaven on earth is all you see, you're out of touch with reality
And now you cry, but when you do, next time around someone cries for you
Everybody plays the fool, sometime
You use your heart just like a tool, listen baby
They never tell you so in school, I wanna say it again,

48,Signed Sealed Delivered Im Yours (ver 2),Stevie Wonder,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/stevie-wonder/signed-sealed-delivered-im-yours-chords-213378," Like a fool, I went and stayed too long.
 Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong.
 Ooh baby, here I am; signed, sealed, de-livered; I'm yours.
 Then that time I went and said goodbye;
 Now I'm back and not a-shamed to cry.
 Ooh baby, here I am; signed, sealed, de-livered; I'm yours.
 Here I am, baby,
 Signed, sealed, de-livered; I'm yours.
 Here I   am, ba-by,
 Signed, sealed, de-livered; I'm yours.
 I've done a-lot of foolish things, that I really didn't mean,
 Seen alot of things in this old world,
 When I touched them, they did nothing, girl.
 Ooh baby, here I am; signed, sealed, de-livered; I'm yours.
 Ooh-wee babe, you set my soul on fire;
 That's why I know you are my only desire.
 Ooh baby, here I am; signed, sealed, de-livered; I'm yours.
 Here I am, baby,
 Signed, sealed, de-livered; I'm yours.
 Here I   am, ba-by,
 Signed, sealed, de-livered; I'm yours.
 I've done a-lot of foolish things, that I really didn't mean,
 With your future, got your future, babe,
(Here I am, baby), here I   am, ba-by,
 Signed Sealed de-livered; I'm yours.
 With your future, got your future, babe,
 Here I   am ba-by;
 Signed Sealed de-livered; I'm yours.
 With your future, got your future, babe,
(Here I am, baby), here I   am, ba-by,
 Signed Sealed de-livered; I'm yours.

Well it's too hot to sleep and too hot to eat
I don't care if I die or not!
Winter night in Harlem, oh oh radiator won't get hot
And that mean ole landlord
He don't care if I freeze to death or not!
Saturday night in Harlem, ah every thing's alright
You can really swing and shake your pretty thing
The parties are out of sight
Sunday morning here in Harlem, now every body's all dressed up
The heathen folk just getting home from the party
And the good folk just got up

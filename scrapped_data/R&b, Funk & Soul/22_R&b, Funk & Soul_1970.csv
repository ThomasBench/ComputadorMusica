Come to live in the light of the beacon of liberty
Plains and open skies
Billboards would advertise
Was it anything like that when you arrived?
Dream boats carried the future to the heart of America
People were waiting in line for a place by the river
It was a time when strangers were welcome here
Music would play they tell me the days were sweet and clear
It was a sweeter tune
And there was so much ro-om
That people could come from everywhere
Now he arrives with his hopes and his heart set on miracles
Come to marry his fortune with a hand full of promises
To find they've closed the door
They don't want him anymore
There isn't any more to go around
Turning away he remembers he once heard a legend
That spoke of a mystical magical land called America
There was a time when strangers were welcome here
Music would play they tell me the days were sweet and clear
It was a sweeter tune

Maybe you will realize you can always

So there's no  telling how many tears you've cried
And like the river told the weeping willow tree 
I can hold your teardrops child just lean on me

He got his mean streak from the gutter, got his kindness from God.
Now, tugboats paint the river, carry coal to the city white dock-liners,
Happiness on the uptown side of party in the morning tide.
Oooh, la la la blackpatch, 
Oooh, la la la blackpatch,
Oooh, la la la blackpatch,
In blackpatch, In blackpatch
Clothes pins on washropes, window-to-window tie,
Socks and bells and nightgowns, 
Tassels in the mornings, tassels in the morning sky.
People are you ready?
People are you trying?
Ready, Ready, Ready, 
I've been trying, I've been thinking,
I've been trying, I've been thinking.
Woman-child on the side street, flashing in blackpatch,
Lipstick on her reefer, waiting for a match.

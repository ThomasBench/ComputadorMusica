Não vale nem um pouquinho
Mas mesmo assim, quero te dar o meu carinho
Para poder até que enfim satisfazer
A nossa solidão
Sem se envolver, já é um pouco complicado
Tô pra conhecer alguém que compre esse ditado
Será que era só eu, ou será que era só eu
Que pensava errado?
A gente dançava junto, a gente comia junto
A gente falava tudo, era tudo junto
   Quando eu vi, eu fui piada
Você ria e eu chorava
Você só me esnobava e não deu em nada
O quê? Sei que você
Não vale nem um pouquinho
Mas mesmo assim, quero te dar o meu carinho
Para poder até que enfim satisfazer
Porque? Sei que você
Não vale nem um pouquinho
Mas mesmo assim, quero te dar o meu carinho
Para poder até que enfim satisfazer
Iê-iê-iê-iê, iê-iê-iê-iê, iê-iê-iê-iê
(Sobe à minha cabeça e cai em mim)
(Sobe à minha cabeça e cai em mim)
Sei que cê é joia falsa
É tanta iluminância
Que eu nem tô ligando se é de verdade
Cê não vale a passagem
Perco até o meu rumo
Quando cê me liga falando bobagem
Mas você me pisa e me faz de trampolim
Mas você me pisa e me faz de trampolim
Sobe à minha cabeça, ooh, e cai em mim
Sobe à minha cabeça, ooh, e cai em mim
O quê?
Não vale nem um pouquinho
Mas mesmo assim
Quero te dar o meu carinho
Para poder, até que enfim satisfazer
O quê? Sei que você
Não vale nem um pouquinho
Mas mesmo assim, quero te dar o meu carinho
Para poder até que enfim satisfazer
Porque? Sei que você
Não vale nem um pouquinho
Mas mesmo assim, quero te dar o meu carinho
Para poder até que enfim satisfazer
A nossa solidão

Turned to soil and I grew up out it

    Crying in my sleep, when the sun came down
Thinking “I am cured, it seems,” but
   I don't know my name at all
   But what else is new
   Should I show my pain at all?
If you only knew
You could try to help
Care is imprecise
All that I have left
Pills and good advice

It could be today
But you’d know the reason why
Please hold me down
Please let me drown
Please hold me down
Please let me drown
I know that something's missing
Or rather, something else is there
I spend the day existing
You spend it being unaware
The times I wake up smiling
Feel like I'm making fun of you
I left the ER crying
So what's the use in trying now?
Please let me down
Don't let me drown
Please let me down
Don't let me drown

I need to feel something
I need to dream something
I need to be something

Then I'm sure I'd be

    I never really understood
What's wrong with me
Or why I'm unapproachable
     But every time I close my eyes
You're lookin' quite like my mirror
    I'm plagiarizing everything
Stuttering soliloquies
Who am I again? (Who are you again?)
Is this the storm before the calm?
Is it the clock, or just the ticking of the bomb?
We sacrifice    what we both need
But if I fight for you then how do we proceed?
And if you fight for me then how do we proceed?
And if we fight again then how do we proceed?

Do  you understand?
'Cause right now, doesn't seem like you can
Start to climb, and then I get a little higher
I'm a coward, it don't matter what I do (Higher)
From “I can't do it anymore” to “I can't do it, I can't do it,”
Told myself I wanna die
So how am I supposed to prove it now?
Spend too many of my minutes getting higher (Higher)
I've attempted way too much to even count (Higher)
I've been committed, but committed to the people that I love
And if I try to love myself, I guess that I could live forever crying
So don't cry for me
For I've found peace in the madness
Peace in the madness
Don't cry for me
For I've found peace in the madness
Peace in the madness
(Don't cry for me)
(For I've found peace in the madness)
(Peace in the madness)
(Don't cry for me)
(For I've found peace in the madness)
(Peace in the madness)
For now
    But on my last day out
Let me scream to God
Family, friends, and enemies
 So what happens next?
Is this what you want?
All I am is dead to me
I can't hear my voice at all
    What was I to do?
Did I have a choice at all?
Seems I never do
You could try to help
Care is imprecise
All that I'd have left
Pills and good advice
I could try to heal
Care is imprecise
All that you'd have left are
Pills and good advice

Who could stand at Hollywood and Vine
Without feeling like some kind of creep
Yeah...
I'll always be uncomfortable
With every paper friend that I have lost
Depending on the day, the week
And how much I have had to eat
Foot on the table
Head on the ground
I tried to tell you
I'll come around
And all that it takes is some time
Asking questions, digging graves
All that I've taken
Someone you wanna love
Then every time
In the end, doesn't get that I rely on you
All that I've taken
Someone you wanna love
Want, oooh, want
And now all I hear is open season
I got held back by sarcastic demons
Hiding in our bathroom floor
Then right behind was someone floating
And right before that wall burst open
I swear to God I heard you call
Foot on the ceiling
Head on your knees
I pray to Kanye you'll never leave
And all that it takes is some time
Asking questions, digging graves
All that I've taken
Someone you wanna love
Then every time
In the end, doesn't get that I rely on you
All that I've taken
Someone you wanna love
Want, oooh, want
But I'm old enough to finally get it
The moon and stars don't follow when I run
And the sky above is not my canvass
And the trees, the trees don't wither when I'm gone
But it's like something, something, pure emotion
It's like something, something, love you till I drop
And I see it all with eyes wide open now
Yeah...
And all that it takes is some time

Why'd you hide your mouth from me?
I'd pray to a different God for you
Tell me I'm your ride or die
Anything I could believe
I would like to live as one with you
I could let you break these laws I once made for me
If you want to, 'cause I want you
But the trouble is
If I give what I've got
Would you hold it up against me?
If I show what I'm not
Will I hurt you like they hurt me?
What I fear I become

Power in the weakest way
Thought I had this set for me
Maybe there's no playing God with you
If there's no turning back, you could repeat my past
Then what would I do?
I don't want to, but I want you

If I give what I've got
Would you hold it up against me?
If I show what I'm not
Will I hurt you like they hurt me?
What I fear I become

To love someone is to lose someone
I wanna let go, I wanna live for two
I wanna be wrong, I wanna learn to lose
I got to get down with nothing left to prove
And if I got you, I had to make it through
And I ain't scared of trouble
'Cause you're worth the trouble
Now I don't approve what I used to choose
If I give what I've got
Would you hold it up against me?

Blasting bossa nova
Waiting up another night, oh, ooh
God, she's a Mona
Drinking mad Corona
Waiting up another night
Find me with the dirty dishes
I've been drying up, I'm cleaning with white out
See it with blurry vision
Oh, I'm fucked up, I'm drowning the sound out
I've been waiting so long
I'm trying to tell you (Tell yo-ou)
That lately, all of my songs
I'm singing about you ('Bout yo-ou)
I don't wanna waste another
I don't wanna waste another
Night, oh, ooh (Anothеr, I don't wanna wait another)
Sleep in the Toyota
Blasting bossa nova
Waiting up another night, oh, ooh
God, she's a Mona
Drinking mad Corona

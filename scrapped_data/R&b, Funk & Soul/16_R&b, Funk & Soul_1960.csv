You hold me here in your arms and say you love me
In between the heartaches
The way you kiss I can tell you're thinking of me
And that makes up for all the heartaches
And the sadness and the tears
Everyone keeps asking me why I stay with you
The way you hurt me 
They can see how many times I'm alone and blue
When you desert me
Oh you come and go without a letter
And they say that I should get up and go
They don't know, they don't know that

Ten miles stretch on an Indiana road
T'was a sky blue Jaguar and a Thunderbird Ford
Jaguar setting on ninety-nine

Had a speed sign sitting at the top of the hill
It said, ""35 miles, and stay in line""
But the Jaguar and Thunderbird never read the sign
Keep cool, little Thunderbird Ford
Ludenville was a real small town
Had a hundred and two and nine acres of ground
Some stool pigeon put the sheriff wise
Told him, ""Park down in Ludenville and catch 'em guys""
Sheriff laid low down, hid in the weeds
Parked for eight days, didn't nobody speed
All of a sudden, dust rose on the road
Said, ""Here come the Jaguar and Thunderbird Ford""
Keep cool, little Thunderbird Ford
Sheriff doubled clutched second, put it in third
Took right after the Jaguar and Thunderbird
He knew he'd get a bonus and a big fat fine
If he caught 'em 'fore they crossed that county line
Sheriff never drove his car a hundred and flat
But if he aimed to get 'em, he'd have to do more than that
Crest of the hill, is about a yard behind
There wasn't but two more miles to the county line
Keep cool, little Thunderbird Ford
Old Sheriff was countin' on the downward grade
With the tall wind pushin', he had it made
Thunderbird saw the Jaguar gainin' speed
And waved ""Goodbye, Jaguar"" and pulled in the lead
Jaguar said, ""You ain't won the race yet""
And pulled back around the Bird like a sabre jet
Sheriff's front bumper was a yard behind
When the T-Bird, Jaguar crossed the line
Keep cool little Thunderbird Ford
Slow down, little Jaguar
Keep cool, little Thunderbird Ford
Slow down, little Jaguar
Keep cool, little Thunderbird Ford
Slow down, little Jaguar
Keep cool, little Thunderbird Ford
Slow down, little Jaguar
Keep cool, little Thunderbird Ford

From this loneliness
There's no hiding place
Inside this cold and empty house I dwell
In darkness with memories
I know so well
I need love know
More then before
I can hardly 
Carry on anymore
My world is empty without you, babe
Without you, babe
(My world is empty) without you, babe
My mind and soul 
Have felt like this
Since love between us
No more exist
And each time that darkness falls
It finds me alone
With these four walls
My world is empty without you, babe
Without you, babe
(My world is empty) without you, babe
Without you, babe
Without you, babe . . .

I can see my life go by
You mean everything to me
Just can't take no more
Throw a smile my way
And the pain I feel inside
Turns to love for you
And I'm yours
      Do lovers ever      need to      hide
The things they really feel in         side
I simply need you to need me
Can't you see
Once I hoped to be
Your lover and your friend
But it turned into a game
I won't play no more
I believe I'm right
When I say you loved me too
It just can't go on
Your love games
Your love games
      Do lovers ever      need to      hide
The things they really feel in         side
If you don’t show your heart to me
Can't you see
Now the time has come
To show you how I feel
The love I gave to you
I can't give no more
Even now I see
The salt tears in your eyes
But it can't go on
Your love games
Your love games

I would watch the starlight in her face
`Cause I was reaching out to understand the cosmic charm
I am just a starchild born in space.
Way up high above the sky, All that beauty passes by, Whole worlds still unknown
And out beyond the blue, There`s a place for people too, It`s time for us to go.
I have seen the sun shine bright in paradise
I have been there, I have seen it
Way up high above the sky, All that beauty passes by, Whole worlds still unknown
And out beyond the blue, There`s a place for people too, It`s time for us to go.
We   have   time (In my dreams)
Time  and   space
While we`re young (Floating free)
We    can   chase               to the stars
Searching for the magic in the universe
Guided by the stars that light my way

Come with me, the teacher said, no side-to-side, look straight ahead
Cause if you want true confidence, you'd best forget your common sense
Go find yourself a point of view and if you need some help to choose
Just dance the dance named after me, if you believe then you will see
Crazy, but true,          Now I believe in you
There was a time,    when we could make head nor tail of the story
Now it's sublime     and we're not afraid any more 'cause we're all true be-lievers

I don't feel tired, but I feel a need to sleep
'Cause my  life, takes on new meaning
When I close my eyes and you reveal yourself to me
That's our  time, time for changes
A time for reason, something only you can see
All my  life I have waited
For a chance to give the love, only you demand of me
Fame and suc-cess are poor  re-lations   
   The more I get, the less     I need it
Happiness is an un-known sen-sation
My heart has a hunger and only you        can        feed   it
Come on, in my dreams tonight, show me where to start
Come on, I need you to shed some light,   I want to sleep on my heart
In the  past for pro-tection
When someone got too close, yet an-other bridge would burn
But I can  find no con-nection
Between the love that you propose and the lessons I have learned
I want to hear your expla  -  nations
You'll never know how much     I need it
I want my tears to bear your re-flection
'Cause my heart has a hunger and only you        can        feed   it
Come on, in my dreams tonight, show me, where to start
Come on, I need you to shed some light,   I'm gonna sleep on my heart
I'm sitting here sur-rounded by pos-sessions
Objects that con-front me night and day
The fruits of my mat-erial ob-session
But it seems the more I earn the more I have to pay
  Come on            come on
  Come on            come on
You've made it clear that blind  am-bition
 Leads nowhere and I don't    need it
I've lost all my fear,  all my inhi   -  bitions
My heart has a hunger but I know you        can        feed   it
Come on, in my dreams tonight, show me, where to start
Come on, I need you to shed some light,   I wanna sleep on my heart (I sleep on my heart)
Come on, in my dreams tonight, show me, where to start
Come on, I need you to shed some light,   I'm gonna sleep on my heart (I sleep on my heart)   
Come on, in my dreams tonight, show me, where to start

I could never lie, For honour I would die, Following the Chin-ese way

Stronger and hotter than a bad girl's dream
Make a bad one good, mmm make a wrong one right
Power of love will keep you home at night

Don't need no credit card to ride this train
It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life

First time you feel it, it might make you sad
Next time you feel it, it might make you mad

It's strong and it's sudden, it can be cruel sometimes
But it might just save your life

Yeah, but you don't care

   Change a hawk to a little white dove,           More than a feeling,  that's the power of love
Tougher than diamonds, rich like cream,        Stronger and harder than a bad girl's dream
   Make a bad one good make a wrong one right,    Power of love will keep you home at night
      You don't need money,          don't take fame           Don't need no credit card to ride this train
        It's strong and it's sudden and it's cruel sometimes   But it might just save your life
That's the power of love        That's the power of love
First time you feel it, it might make you sad, Next time you feel it it might make you mad
But you'll be glad baby when you've found,      That's the power makes the world go 'round
       You don't need money,          don't take fame           Don't need no credit card to ride this train
       It's strong and it's sudden and it can be cruel sometimes   But it might just save your life
    They say that all in love is fair   Yeah, but you don't care
But you know what to do   When it gets hold of you
And with a little help from above
You feel the power of love        You feel the power of love         Can you feel it?
      It don't take money          and it don't take fame       Don't need no credit card to ride this train

I needed someone that I could trust
But you smashed down all my faith with your callous lies
From the etchin' of daybreak to the canvas of moonlight
And now, I'm so scared that your reveal what's mine
The trail, you led me down
Betrayal, you let me down
The trail, I'm so ashamed of you

Tears are what brought you Now you brought gloom
In the fadin' light of sun I hear my empty heart bloom
Can you ever explain Your need to cause me pain?
pain
I hear the whispers in the Soho Cafes
The poison gossip of the 10 'P' arcades
Of looks and the stares of those who know
Now their hateful eyes are the one's I close
And I'm so scared of the years ahead

And there's a light in your eyes
Shining from deep inside your heart
So stay here in my life
Like a windsong
Carry me along inside the windsong
Waited for so long to hear a love song
Loving you and happy just to be
Like a windsong
Sing your song for me I'll be your windsong
Soft like summer breezes singing love songs
Listen to the melody
'Cause there's a light in your eyes
Shining from deep inside your heart
So stay here in my life
Like a windsong
Carry me along inside the windsong
Waiting for so long to hear a love song
Loving you and happy just to be
Like a windsong
     Like a windsong
Carry me along
I've waited for so long to hear your melody
Like a windsong

Did you make love yesterday?
Did you make love last week?
Did you make love last year?

But just remember, when you start making love
You make it hard, long, soft, short, and be strokin'

I don't stop until I know she's sassified
And I can always tell when she gets sassified
because when she gets sassified she start calling my name
She'd say: 'Clarence Carter, Clarence Carter, Clarence Carter
Clarence Carter, ooh shit, Clarence Carter'
The other night I was strokin' my woman
And it got so good to her, you know what she told me
Let me tell you what she told me, she said:
'Stroke it Clarence Carter, but don't stroke so fast

When she kissed me I was born and she said goodbye
And I knew right away I was born to cry
Now I'm happy and the joke's on her
She took my love, said she's not comin back
So my world and my sky was all turnin black
Now I see the light, I'm wise to her
Cause I found that place for lovers who wander
A walkin around thinkin about her
Never thought I could live without her
She broke my heart, I really showed it
Look at me now, you'd never know it
Now my story can be told with a smiling face
I'm the luckiest guy in the human race
My lovers dreams have gone for her
Cause I found that place for lover's who wander
Wo wo wo yeah, she took my love you see
Yeah, she doesn't bother me
Yeah I found that place to be
Yeah, ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Yeah walkin around thinkin about her
I never thought I could live without her
She broke my heart, I really showed it
Look at me now, you'd never know it
Now my story can be told with a smiling face
I'm the luckiest guy in the human race
My love dreams have gone for her

We would be friends

They'd say come  to me
So  I'd say to you
Can   we talk for a while
You'd  say it’s alright
When you love me, I smile
I feel your hands, and you  feel mine
You bring me joy

Too far away
If I can't see your face
I will remember your smile
But can  this be right
Oh, and should we be friends

And I'm mixed up again

I've seen in all my  life

I woke up underground
Not a light, not a sound
I threw my voice into the dark
But the dark had no remark, 
Just repeated what I said
Claustrophobic at first
Struck by hunger and thirst
I stood up and looked around
There was nothing to be found
Just a world I couldn't see
And I heard whoo
I can't see you now
I'll find my way underground
Then my fear began to ease
From far away whispered a breeze
Telling me to move along
Move along there's nothing wrong
So I cornered my resolve
Took a breath and took a step
Encountered metal on my left
What a strange thing to find
Metal in this place of mine
Running lengthwise down the hall
And I heard whoo
Then a light shown through the black
I was standing on a track
That little light began to grow
There was no where I could go
Oh oh and the ground began to shake 
No time left to hit the brake
That little light was closing in
And suddenly I'm falling 
Oh I see you now, oh
You found me here underground

But it won't help you sleep
He could give you a watch
But not his time to keep
He could fly you to Verona or a mountain in the snow
He won't know the places that we used to go
I  heard he's best friends with Hollywood now
He  can     afford all the champagne in town
I heard he's got a big house up on easy street
But I've got a big heart that I want you to keep
My fair-weather friend
I wish you could see
He'll ne-ver love you
Quite like me
He'll sing you a sad song just like one of mine
But I know it won't make you cry
Don't you    remember
The promise we made
As our shadows grew long
In the field where we lay
That you'd always be you,
And I'd always be me
As the sun fell asleep
And so did we
My fair-weather friend
I wish you could see
He'll ne-ver love you
Quite like me
He'll sing you a sad song just like one of mine
But I know it won't make you cry
My fair-weather friend

Can't go back in time to change in someone's eyes that I was not something to play with
Try not to talk about it, I'm too mad, I'm too late, I'm too gentle
It's too hard to explain, I'm not helpful

It's my body and I'm trying to while everybody loves you
It's my body and I'm trying to forgive you, I don't want to
It's my body and it hates you, why does everybody love you?
Sometimes I close my eyes amidst the dancing lights
When it feels too wild for breathing
I can't sleep at night, unless I start to lie and believe it like a story
Try not to think about it so insane, I'm so used to my nightmares
It's ok 'til it's not and I'm back there
It's my body and I'm trying to hate you cause I want to
It's my body and I'm trying to while everybody loves you

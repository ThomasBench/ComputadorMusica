That you can't be scared to try
I want you to touch it softly
Like the way you do my mind
It got body and it's smooth to touch
The same way as my skin
But don't you be scared
To run your hands through my hair
Baby, 'cause that's why it's there
Come run your hands through my hair
Ooh, baby, so don't you be scared
So come run your hands through my hair
It's been way long overdue
Just like these inches down my back
Usually don't let people touch it
But tonight, you get a pass
Spend my dimes and spend my time
To keep it real, sometimes it's tracks
But I don't care, mmm
So run your hands through my hair
Baby, 'cause that's why it's there
Come run your hands through my hair
Ooh, baby, so don't you be scared
So come run your hands through my hair
Know this ain't usually mе
But I might let it down for ya (Mmm)
This ain't usually me (Usually me)
But I might lеt it down for ya
So run your hands through my hair
Baby, 'cause that's why it's there
So come run your hands through my hair
Oh, don't you be scared
Come run your hands through my hair

Would I double back or do the same thing twice?

Don't give it up for just somebody
Instead of goin' through the motions
And give me love just like an ocean
It's always a scary thing
When your love's so high, you're bound to fall together, fall together
Feelin' the passion, babe
And when we fight, it's always now or never, now or never
I just wanna know right now
Do you wanna, you wanna work this out?
And baby, you know it's a long way down
Then you know that I, I ain't afraid of heights, heights
Maybe we don't need to get so heated, I'm just tryna talk
Forget about the ""he said, she said,"" I think we should stop and
Gеt back to basics to practice some patiencе
It's too good to waste it, too good
It's always a scary thing
When your love's so high, you're bound to fall together, fall together
I'm feelin' the passion, babe
And when we fight, it's always now or never, now or never
I just wanna know right now (I just wanna know right now)
Do you wanna, you wanna work this out?
And, baby, you know it's a long way down (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Then you know that I (Then you know that I), I ain't afraid of heights (I ain't afraid of heights, yeah)
Somethin' 'bout the love we found (Somethin' 'bout the love we found)
I don't wanna, I don't wanna lose it now
And, baby, you know it's a long way down (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Then you know that I (Then you know that I), I ain't afraid of heights (I ain't afraid of heights)
It's always a scary thing
When your love's so high, you're bound to fall together, fall together

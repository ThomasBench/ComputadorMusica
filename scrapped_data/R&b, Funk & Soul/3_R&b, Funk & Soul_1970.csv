And the answer to / all my dreams
You're my sun, my moon /   My guiding star
   My kind of wonderful / that's what you are
I know there's only, only one like you
There's no way / they could have made two
      You're all I'm living for
Your love I'll keep / For evermore
You're the first, you're the last, my ev'-ry-thing
With you I found / So many things,
Our love so new only you / could bring
Can't you see it's you / You make me feel this way
   You're like a first morning dew / On a brand new day
I see       so many ways that I
Can love you 'Till the day I die
      You're my re-al-i-ty / yet I'm lost when I'm free
You're the first, you're the last, my ev-'ry-thing

Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely made from love

Truely the angel's best
Boy, I'm so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I can't believe what God has done
Through us he's given life to one
But isn't she lovely made from love

Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name
Londie, it could have not been done
Without you who conceived the one
That's so very lovely made from love.

Isn't she wonder-ful
Isn't she precious
Less than one minute old
I never thought through love we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely made from love
Isn't she pretty
Truly the angel's best
Boy, I'm so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I can't believe what God has done
Through us he's given life to one
But isn't she lovely made from love
Isn't she lovely?
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name
Londie, it could have not been done
Without you who conceived the one
That's so very lovely made from love

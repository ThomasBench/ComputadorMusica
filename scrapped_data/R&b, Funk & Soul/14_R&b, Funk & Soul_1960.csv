Filled with sadness and confusion.
What becomes of the broken hearted
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Maybe.
The roots of love grow all around
But for me they come a tumblin' down.
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger,
I can't stand this pain much longer!
I walk in shadows,
Searching for light.
Cold and alone,
No comfort in sight.
Hoping and praying for someone who care,
Always moving and goin' nowhere.
What becomes of the broken hearted
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find,
Some kind of peace of mind.
Help me.. please
I'm searching though I don't succeed,
For someone's love, there's a growing need.
All is lost, there's no place for beginning,
All that's left is an unhappy ending.
Now what becomes of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed?
I know I've got to find,
Some kind of peace of mind,
I'll be searching everywhere,
Just to find someone to care.
I'll be looking everyday,
I know I'm gonna find a way.
Nothings gonna stop me now,
I'll find a way somehow.
I'll be searching everywhere..

I have visions of many things
But happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion
What becomes of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find

Maybe...
The roots of love grow all around
But for me they come a-tumblin' down
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer
I walk in shadows searching for light
Cold and alone, no comfort in sight

Always moving and goin' nowhere

I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love  ... to me
Lonely rivers flow to the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers sigh: “Wait for me, wait for me,
I'll be coming home, wait for me!”
O my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
Time goes by  ...  so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love ... to me

44,Compared To What,Roberta Flack,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/roberta-flack/compared-to-what-chords-2957453,"Love the lie and lie the love
Hangin' on, with a push and shove
Possession is the motivation
That is hangin' up the God-damn nation
Looks like we always end up in a rut (everybody now!)
Slaughterhouse is killin' hogs
Twisted children killin' frogs
Poor dumb rednecks rollin' logs
Tired old ladies kissin' dogs
Hate the human, love that stinking mutt (I can't stand it!)
The President, he's got his war
Folks don't know just what it's for
Nobody gives us rhyme or reason
Have one doubt, they call it treason
With chicken feathers   all the way out one nut  (God damn it!)
Church on Sunday, sleep and nod
Tryin' to duck the wrath of God
Preacher's fillin' us with fright
Tryin' to tell us what he thinks is right
He really got to be some kind of nut (I can't use it!)
Where's that bee and where's that honey?
Where's my God and where's my money
Unreal values, crass distortion
Unwed mothers need abortion
Kind of brings to mind ol' young King Tut (He did it now)

Never, never make her cry
'Cause you'll always miss the water
When the well goes dry
Make true love to your lover
When the moon's high in the sky
'Cause you'll always miss the water
When the well goes dry
It's tough to be alone
And you're love is not there
It's rough to need your heart
Lying in your solitaire
So, be sweet to your sweetheart
And she'll never say goodbye
Then the water in your well
Will never, never go dry

Will never, never go dry

Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December our hearts will see
A world where men are free   mmmmmm
Someday at Christmas there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime
Someday at Christmas we'll see a land
No hungry children, no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
A world where people care  ooooooooh
Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
One shining moment, one prayer away
From our world today
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime
Someday at Christmas man will not fail
Hate will be gone and love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heaaaaaaart  yeah
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me

Waiting for someone to come by
One little Christmas tree that never had grown
Cried as he looked up to the sky
Oh please Mr. Father tree, the tallest of all
I'm so afraid and so alone
Could one little Christmas tree so tiny and small
Light up someone's home 'cause
One little Christmas tree can light up a home
So one little child can find a toy
One little Christmas tree can light up a home
So one little heart can find some joy
One little angel who was riding a star
Cried as she looked down at the tree
Oh please Mr. Father tree wherever you are
May I give him the star you gave to me
Then in the heavens came a voice from afar
A voice that was heard throughout the world
Go down little angel girl and give him your star
Tonight he'll light the world 'cause
One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So those who are lost may find their way
One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So all men may see on Christmas day
One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So those who are lost may find their way
One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So all men may see on Christmas day
One little Christmas tree can light up the world
So those who are lost may find their way

Jack frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all a-glow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Saaaaaanta's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every Mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Mommy says that it's time for sleep
If my folks were wiser and older
They'd know kids and toys don't need sleep
Don't be bad little cotton dolly
See how nice Mickey Mouse sleeps now?
Even my brass drummer boy has stopped all his noise
    Cause he knows it's past bedtime for toys
Ya know, every Christmas Santa Claus goes all over the world with his reindeer
Sled, and a big bag of toys and he'll come to your house this year too
But sometimes, just sometimes, he doesn't have enough time to see every little boy and girl
So maybe we should sing a song for all the children that Santa didn't visit
Bless the child who has no tin soldier
No brass drummer boy to put to bed
He will still grow wiser and older
Loving one small rag doll instead
He won't have a cotton dolly
Mickey Mouse won't come to his house
Hold that rag doll to your heart,    nothing can destroy
     The beauty one child finds in one small toy

You lookin' for a girl that'll treat you right?
You lookin' for her in the daytime with the light?
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
You expect me to just let you hit it?
But will you still respect me if you get it?
All I can do is try, gimme one chance (Chance)
What's the problem? I don't see no ring on your hand (Hand)
   I'll be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna get in my world, get lost in it?
Boy, I'm tired of runnin', let's walk for a minute

Hey! I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at? Do you mind if I come through?
I'm out of this world, come with me to my planet
Get you on my level, do you think that you can handle it?
They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game, I'ma lay mine's down
I'm a big girl, I can handle myself
But if I get lonely, I'ma need your help
Pay attention to me, I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team. So does everybody else
Shh! Baby, we can keep it on the low
Let your guard down, ain't nobody gotta know

To see if you can work me the way you say

  She said she's tired that I'm always on the road
  Too hard to swallow being alone
She needs someone at night that she can hold
  She must have told me a thousand times before
  Silent cries I use to ignore
  God knows I love her
Didn't mean to hurt her
Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and to be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene
  She knows I really love this old music thing
  Since I was a child it's been my dream
  I can support her treat her and spoil her
  You know buy her the finer things
  But I forgot about loving her
  Damn the money, diamonds and pearls
  What about the hard day she had with the baby
  All she need is for me to love her
Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and to be with you for life
Come on home to me Charlene
  Promise I can't live without her
  God knows I need her loving
  And it hurts so bad that's she gone
I pray that she'll come back one day
In my life
Baby I'll be
Sitting here waiting on you to come home again
I won't leave
Promise I'll be here to the very end
By your side
To protect you and to love you and to be with you for life

I might look like a wild one
But I would never, never, never stray far from you

When I've got nothin' to say
I get deadly quiet when I really, really need your help

Searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul
'Cause it seems that one
Really loves my company
He's more than a man
And this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
But clouds are rollin' in
Because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy
With some other guy
   I don't wanna do this anymore
   I don't wanna be the reason why
Everytime I walk out the door
 I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
   I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be...
a murderer
I feel it in the air
As I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly
Accepts i'm gonna be out late
I say I won't belong
Just hangin' with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know
Where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside

We're ten thousand miles apart

My California king
 Eye to eye
 Cheek to cheek
 Side by side
You were sleeping next to me
 Arm in arm
 Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last nite on these sheets

Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter
So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But I don’t wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming

Playing house in the ruins of us
Running back through the fire

But don't be offended,  this is all my opinion, ain't nothing that I'm saying' law
This is a true confession of a life learned lesson I was sent here to share with y'all
So get in where you fit in, go on and shine, clear your mind, now's the time
Put your salt on the shelf, go on and love yourself, cuz everything's gonna be all right
Keep your fancy drinks and your expensive minks, I don't need that to have a good time
Keep your expensive car and your caviar, all I need is my guitar
Keep your Kristal and your pistol, I'd rather have a pretty piece of crystal
Don't need your silicone, I prefer my own, what God gave me is just fine

22,Officially Missing You (ver 4),Tamia,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tamia/officially-missing-you-chords-922794,"All I hear is raindrops falling on the rooftop 
Oh baby, tell me why'd you have to go 
'Cause this pain I feel it won't go away 
And today I'm officially missin' you 
All I do is lay around, 2 ears full of tears 
From looking at your face on the wall 
Just a week ago you were my baby 
Now I don't even know you at all, I don't know you at all 
Well, I wish that you would call me right now 
So that I could get through to you somehow 
But I guess it's safe to say, baby, safe to say 
that I-I'm officially missin' you 
Well, I thought I could just get over you, baby 
But I see there's something I just can't do 
From the way you would hold me 
To the sweet things you told me 
I just can't find a way to let go of you

But it grew from a simple crush, crush, crush, crush
Being without you girl, i was all messed up, up, up, up
When you walked out, said that you'd had enough-nough-nough-nough
Been a fool, girl i know
Didn't expect this is how things would go
Maybe in time, you'll change your mind
Now looking back i wish i could rewind
Because i can't sleep til you're next to me
No i can't live without you no more
Oh i stay up til you're next to me
Til this house feels like it did before
Feels like insomnia, ah ah..feels like insomnia, ah ah
Feels like insomnia, ah ah..feels like insomnia, ah ah
Remember telling my boys that i'd never fall in love, love, love, love
You used to think i'd never find a girl i could trust, trust, trust, trust
And then you walked into my life and it was all about us, us, us, us
But now i'm sitting here thinking i messed the whole thing up, up, up, up
Been a fool (fool), girl i know (know)
Didn't expect this is how things would go
Maybe in time (time), you'll change your mind (mind)

Ah, i just can't go to sleep                        
Cause it feels like i've fallen for you
It's getting way too deep
And i know that it's love because

No i can't live without you no more (without you no more)
Oh i stay up til you're next to me (to me)

Trying to keep my eyes closed
Trying to keep it just like before
The times we never even thought to speak
Don’t wanna tell you what it is
Oh wee it felt so serious
Got me thinking just too much
I wanna set it off, but
It’s this 1 thing that’s got me trippin
It’s this 1 thing that’s got me trippin (you did)
This 1 thing my soul may be feeling
It’s this 1 thing you did oh oh
It’s this 1 thing that caught me slippin

This 1 thing and I was so with it

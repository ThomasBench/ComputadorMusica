  If you can't hear   what I'm trying to say
  Maybe I'm going deaf,   maybe I'm going blind
  OK now he was close,   tried to domesticate you
  Just let me liberate you
Good girl
You're a good girl
I hate these blurred lines
But you're a good girl
What do they make dreams for
I feel so lucky
OK now he was close, tried to domesticate you
Just let me liberate you
And that's why I'm gon' take a good girl
You're a good girl
I hate these blurred lines
But you're a good girl
One thing I ask of you
So hit me up when you passing through
Then, honey you're not there when I'm
So I just watch and wait for you to salute
Shake the vibe, get down, get up
Do it like it hurt, like it hurt
Baby can you breathe? I got this from Jamaica
No more pretending
I always wanted a good girl
You're a good girl
I hate these blurred lines
But you're a good girl
Everybody get up
Hey, hey, hey

1,Never Enough,Rex Orange County,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/rex-orange-county/never-enough-chords-2262913,"Now there's no one left to blame
And your face stays the same
You're ashamed to say you feel relieved
Stay away from your own family
But years from now
If you could make them proud
You could leave the world and feel like you've achieved the things you hoped to do but
Honestly I don't feel ordinary cause I haven't been at home in a while
Tell them that it's only temporary
I'm trying my best to smile
But that's never enough
Cause when you lose the ones you love
You might find it hard to cry
Until it's only you and everybody else has left the room
You might feel what it's like to not know how to feel
You see, my old lady's old man just now left
And there's nothing i can say except this long awaited rest
Is a good thing and all good things must come to an end
It's right in front of me so there's no reason to pretend Except I'm afraid to die
If this were a movie, you'd be taking our kids to school
And I'd be Channing Tatum or somebody sexy
Somebody cool
Years from now
If you could make them proud
You could leave the world and feel like you've achieved the things you hoped to do but
Honestly I don't feel ordinary cause I haven't left my house in a while
Tell them that it's only temporary
I'm trying my best to smile
But that's never enough
Cause when you lose the ones you love
You might find it hard to cry
Until it's only you and everybody else has left the room
You might feel what it's like to not know how to feel
Don't tell me you're sorry
You're just sorry for yourself

New berry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Got 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds saying Mom's confused
I'm for sure she doesn't wanna learn
But Daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know, what you let 'em see
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Know well like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Saturday nights
That gray Silverado
You drive it 'cause you have to
Stay up working late at a job you hate
Fix your makeup in a dirty bathroom
All my love in the dark clouds
I know what you gotta do
You got plans, wrapped in rubber bands
And that's the only thing you'll never lose
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know, what you let 'em see
All the things that I know

Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally, mo - o - ove me baby

 Its reasoning made lucid and cool
And though it's no improvement
When you move, I move
 You're less Polunin leapin'
 Or Fred Astaire in sequins, honey
  You, you're Atlas in his sleepin'
And when you move, I'm moved
When you move, I can recall something that's gone from me

You seem to replace
Your brain with your heart
You take things so hard
And then you fall apart
You try to explain
But before you can start
Those cry baby tears
Come out of the dark
Someone's turning the handle
To that faucet in your eyes
They're pouring out
Where everyone can see
Your heart's too big for your body
It's where your feelings hide
They're pouring out
Where everyone can see
They call you cry baby, cry baby
But you don't fucking care
Cry baby, cry baby
So you laugh through your tears
Cry baby, cry baby
Cause you don't fucking care
Tears fall to the ground
You just let them drown
You're all on your own and
You lost all your friends
You told yourself that
It's not you, it's them
You're one of a kind
And no one understands
But those cry baby tears
Keep coming back again
Someone's turning the handle
To that faucet in your eyes
They're pouring out
Where everyone can see
Your heart's too big for your body
It's where your feelings hide
They're pouring out
Where everyone can see
They call you cry baby, cry baby
But you don't fucking care
Cry baby, cry baby
So you laugh through your tears
Cry baby, cry baby
Cause you don't fucking care
Tears fall to the ground
You just let them drown
Cry baby, cry baby
You just let them drown
Cry baby, cry baby
You just let them drown
I look at you and I see myself
I know you better than anyone else
I have the same faucet in my eyes
So your tears
Are mine
They call me cry baby, cry baby
But I don't fucking care
Cry baby, cry baby
So I laugh through my tears
Cry baby, cry baby
Cause I don't fucking care
Tears fall to the ground
I just let them drown
They call me cry baby, cry baby
But I don't fucking care
Cry baby, cry baby
So I laugh through my tears
Cry baby, cry baby
Cause I don't fucking care
Tears fall to the ground
I just let them drown
Hey girl, open the walls 
Play with your dolls
We'll be a perfect family
When you walk away
Is when we really play
You don't hear me when I say
Mom, please wake up
Dad's with a slut
And your son is smoking cannabis
No one ever listens
This wallpaper glistens
Don't let them see what goes down in the kitchen
Places, places
Get in your places
Throw on your dress and put on your doll faces
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
Picture, picture, smile for the picture
Pose with your brother, won't you be a good sister?
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees
Hey girl, look at my mom
She's got it going on
Ha, you're blinded by her jewelry
When you turn your back
She pulls out a flask
And forgets his infidelity
Uh oh she's coming to the attic, plastic
Go back to being plastic
No one ever listens
This wallpaper glistens
Don't let them see what goes down in the kitchen
Places, places
Get in your places
Throw on your dress and put on your doll faces
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
Picture, picture, smile for the picture
Pose with your brother, won't you be a good sister?
Everyone thinks that we're perfect

 Blood still stains when the sheets are washed
 Sex don't sleep when the lights are off
 Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
 And syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
 He's still dead when you're done with the bottle
 Of course it's a corpse that you keep in the cradle
 Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
 Syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
 Blood money, blood money
 How did you afford this ring that I love, honey?
 ""Just another shift at the drug company,"" 
 He doesn't think I'm that fucking dumb does he?
 It doesn't matter what you pull up to your home, we know what goes on inside
 You call that ass your own, we call that silicone
 Silly girl, we're silly, boys
 Blood still stains when the sheets are washed
 Sex don't sleep when the lights are off
 Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
 And syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
 He's still dead when you're done with the bottle
 Of course it's a corpse that you keep in the cradle
 Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
 Syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
 Sippy cup, s-s-sippy cup, in a sippy cup, sippy cup
 In a sippy cup, in a sippy cup, in a sippy cup, in a sippy cup
 Pill diet, pill diet, if they give you a new pill then you will buy it
 If they say to kill yourself, then you will try it
 All the makeup in the world, won't make you less insecure
 You got weights in your pockets, when you go to the doctor's
 Your favorite candy's cotton, that's why all your teeth are rotten
 Silly girl, we're silly, boys
 Blood still stains when the sheets are washed
 Sex don't sleep when the lights are off
 Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
 And syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
 He's still dead when you're done with the bottle
 Of course it's a corpse that you keep in the cradle
 Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
 Syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
 Sippy cup, s-s-sippy cup, in a sippy cup, sippy cup
 In a sippy cup, in a sippy cup, in a sippy cup, in a sippy cup
 Blood still stains when the sheets are washed
 Sex don't sleep when the lights are off
 Kids are still depressed when you dress them up
 And syrup is still syrup in a sippy cup
Round and round like a horse on a carousel, we go
Will I catch up to love, I could never tell, I know
Chasing after you is like a fairytale, but I
Feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
Come, come one, come all, you must be this tall
To ride this ride at the carnival
Oh, come take my hand, and run through playland
So high, too high at the carnival
And it’s all fun and games, 'til somebody falls in love
But you've already bought a ticket, and there’s no turning back now
Round and round like a horse on a carousel, we go
Will I catch up to love, I could never tell, I know
Chasing after you is like a fairytale, but I
Feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
This horse is too slow, we’re always this close
Almost, almost, we’re a freakshow
Right, right when I’m near, it’s like you disappear
Where’d you go, is that Houdini or a freakshow
And it’s all fun and games, 'til somebody falls in love
But you've already bought a ticket, and there’s no turning back now
Round and round like a horse on a carousel, we go
Will I catch up to love, I could never tell, I know
Chasing after you is like a fairytale, but I
Feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
Why did you steal my cotton candy heart
You threw it in this damn coin slot
And now I’m stuck, I'm stuck
Riding, riding, riding
Round and round like a horse on a carousel, we go
Will I catch up to love, I could never tell, I know
Chasing after you is like a fairytale, but I
Feel like I'm glued on tight to this carousel
You're always aiming paper airplanes at me when you're around
You build me up like building blocks just so you can bring me down
You can crush my candy cane but you'll never catch me cry
If you dangle that diploma and I deck you, don't be surprised
I know my ABC's, yet you keep teaching me
I say, fuck your degree, alphabet boy
You think you're smarter than me with all your bad poetry
Fuck all your ABC's, alphabet boy
I'm not a little kid now
Watch me get big now
Spell my name on the fridge now
With all your alphabet toys
You won the spelling bee now
But are you smarter than me now?
You're the prince of the playground
Little alphabet boy
Apples aren't an always appropriate apologies
Butterscotch and bubblegum drops are bittersweet to me
You call me a child while you keep counting all your coins
But you're not my daddy and I'm not your dolly
And your dictionary's destroyed
I know my ABC's, yet you keep teaching me
I say, fuck your degree, alphabet boy
You think you're smarter than me with all your bad poetry
Fuck all your ABC's, alphabet boy
I'm not a little kid now
Watch me get big now
Spell my name on the fridge now
With all your alphabet toys
You won the spelling bee now
But are you smarter than me now?
You're the prince of the playground
Little alphabet boy

  Think I just remembered something
  I think I left the faucet running
   Now my words are filling up the tub
  Darling you're just soaking in it
  But I know you'll get out the minute
  You notice all your fingers 
pruning up
I'm tired of being careful, tip-toe, 
trying to keep the water warm
Let me under your skin
Uh oh there it goes, I said too much, it overflowed
Why do I always spill?
  I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
  God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap
  Think I got myself in trouble
  So I fill the bath with bubbles
  Then I'll put the towels all away
  Should've never said the word ""love""
  Threw a toaster in the bathtub
  I'm sick of all the games 
I have to play
I'm tired of being careful, tip-toe,
trying to keep the water warm
Let me under your skin
Uh oh there it goes, I said too much, it overflowed
Why do I always spill?
  I feel it coming out my throat
Guess I better wash my mouth out with soap
  God I wish I never spoke
Now I gotta wash my mouth out with soap
Riding down, riding down
My hand on your seat
I carry band-aids on me now
For when your soft hands hit the jagged ground
Wheels aren't even touching the ground
Scared to take them off but they're so warm now
Promise I won't push you straight to the dirt
If you promise me you'll take them off first
I love everything you do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you  
I love everything you do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you  
Letting go, letting go
Telling you things you already know
I explode, I explode
Asking you where you want us to go
You've been riding two wheelers all your life
It's not like I'm asking to be your wife
I wanna make you mine, but that's hard to say
Is this coming off in a cheesy way?
I love everything you do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you  
I love everything you do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you  
I love everything you do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you  
I love everything you do
I wanna ride my bike with you
Fully undressed, no training wheels left for you
I'll pull them off for you
Did my invitations disappear
Why'd I put my heart on every cursive letter?
Tell me why the hell no one is here
Tell me what to do to make it all feel better
Maybe it's a cruel joke on me
Whatever, whatever
Just means there's way more cake for me
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
Maybe if I knew all of them well
I wouldn't have been trapped inside this hell that holds me
Maybe if I casted out a spell
But told them decorations were in pastel ribbons
Maybe it's a cruel joke on me
Whatever, whatever
Just means there's way more cake for me
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
I'm laughing, I'm crying
It feels like I'm dying
I'm laughing, I'm crying
It feels like I'm dying
I'm laughing, I'm crying
It feels like I'm dying
I'm dying, I'm dying
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
I'll cry until the candles burn down this place
I'll cry until my pity party's in flames
It's my party, it's-it's my party
It's my party, it's-it's my party
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to (cry, cry, cry)
Looking at me through your window
Boy, you had your eye out for a little
""I'll cut you up and make you dinner
You've reached the end, you are the winner""
Rolling down your tinted window
Driving next to me real slow, he said
""Let me take you for a joyride
I've got some candy for you inside""
Running through the parking lot
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Grabbed my hand, pushed me down
Took the words right out my mouth
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Can anybody hear me? I'm hidden under ground
Can anybody hear me? Am I talking to myself?
Saying, ""tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it""
He's saying, ""tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it""
Little bit of poison in me
I can taste your skin in my teeth
""I love it when I hear you breathing
I hope to God you're never leaving""
Running through the parking lot
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Grabbed my hand, pushed me down
Took the words right out my mouth
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Can anybody hear me? I'm hidden under ground
Can anybody hear me? Am I talking to myself?
Saying, ""tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it""
He's saying, ""tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it""
Eenie meenie miny mo
Get your lady by her toes
If she screams, don't let her go
Eenie meenie miny mo
Your mother said to pick the very best girl
And I am
Running through the parking lot
He chased me and he wouldn't stop
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Grabbed my hand, pushed me down
Took the words right out my mouth
Tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it
Can anybody hear me? I'm hidden under ground
Can anybody hear me? Am I talking to myself?
Saying, ""tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it""
He's saying, ""tag, you're it, tag, tag, you're it""
1,  2,   melatonin is coming for you
3,  4,   baby, won't you lock the door?
5,  6,   I'm done with it
7,  8, it's getting late, so close your eyes, sleep for days
 Hush, little baby, drink your spoiled milk
 I'm fucking crazy, need my prescription filled
 Do you like my cookies? They're made just for you
A little bit of sugar, but lots of poison, too
Ashes, ashes, time to go down
  Ooh, honey do you want me now?
  Can't take it anymore, need to put you to bed
  Sing you a lullaby where you die at the end
9,  10,   never want to see you again
11,  12,   I pull off black so well
Shit behind the curtain that I'm sick of sugarcoatin'
Next time you're alone, think fast when you grab the phone
Ashes, ashes, time to go down
  Ooh, honey do you want me now?
  Can't take it anymore, need to put you to bed
  Sing you a lullaby where you die at the end
Ashes, ashes, time to go down
  Ooh, honey do you want me now?
  Can't take it anymore, need to put you to bed
  Sing you a lullaby where you die at the end
Tired, blue boy walks my way
Holding a girls hand
That basic bitch leaves finally
Now I can take her man
  Someone told me stay away from things that aren’t yours
But was it yours, if he wanted me so bad?
  Pacify her
She’s getting on my nerves
Stop lying with those words 
  Pacify her
She’s getting on my nerves
Stop lying with those words
I can’t stand her whining
Where’s her binky now?
And loving her seems tiring
So boy, just love me, down, down, down
  Someone told me stay away from things that aren’t yours
But was it yours, if he wanted me so bad?
  Pacify her
She’s getting on my nerves
Stop lying with those words 
  Pacify her
She’s getting on my nerves
Stop lying with those words
  Pacify her
She’s getting on my nerves
  Pacify her
She’s getting on my nerves
Stop lying with those words 
  Pacify her
She’s getting on my nerves
Stop lying with those words
If you weren't born with it
You can buy a couple ornaments
Just be sure to read the warning, kids
Cause pretty soon you'll be bored of it
Sexual, hey girl if you wanna feel sexual
You can always call up a professional
They stick pins in you like a vegetable
Kids forever, kids forever
Baby soft skin turns into leather
Don't be dramatic it's only some plastic
  Oh Mrs. Potato Head tell me, 
  is it true that pain is beauty?
  Does a new face come with a warranty?
  Will a pretty face make it better?
  Oh Mr. Potato Head tell me
  How did you afford her surgery?
  Do you swear you'll stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
       Even if her face don't stay together
If you want a little more confidence
Potatoes turn to french fries, yeah it's common sense
All you need's a couple more condiments
And a hundred thousand dollars for some compliments
It's such a waste
When little girls grow into their mothers face
But little girls are learning how to cut and paste
And pucker up their lips until they suffocate
Kids forever, kids forever
Baby soft skin turns into leather
Don't be dramatic it's only some plastic
  Oh Mrs. Potato Head tell me, 
  is it true that pain is beauty?
  Does a new face come with a warranty?
  Will a pretty face make it better?
  Oh Mr. Potato Head tell me
  How did you afford her surgery?
  Do you swear you'll stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
  Oh Mrs. Potato Head tell me, 
  is it true that pain is beauty?
  Does a new face come with a warranty?
  Will a pretty face make it better?
  Oh Mr. Potato Head tell me
  How did you afford her surgery?
  Do you swear you'll stay forever
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
Stay forever, stay forever
Even if her face don't stay together
My friends don't walk they run
Skinny dip in rabbit holes for fun
Poppin' poppin' balloons with guns
Getting high off helium
We paint white roses red
Each shade from a different persons head
This dream dream is a killer
Getting drunk with the blue caterpillar
Now I'm peeling the skin off my face
Cause I really hate being safe
The normals they make me afraid
The crazy they make me feel sane
I'm nuts!
Baby, I'm mad
Craziest friend that you've ever had
You think I'm psycho
You think I'm gone
Tell the psychiatrist something is wrong
Over the bend
Entirely bonkers
You like me best when I'm off my rocker
Tell you a secret
I'm not alarmed
So what if I'm crazy?
The best people are
All the best people are crazy
All the best people are
Where is my prescription?
Doctor, doctor please listen
My brain is scattered
You can be Alice,
I'll be the mad hatter.
Now I'm peeling the skin off my face
Cause I really hate being safe
The normals they make me afraid
The crazy they make me feel sane
I'm nuts!
Baby, I'm mad
Craziest friend that you've ever had
You think I'm psycho
You think I'm gone
Tell the psychiatrist something is wrong
Over the bend
Entirely bonkers
You like me best when I'm off my rocker
Tell you a secret
I'm not alarmed
So what if I'm crazy?
The best people are
You think I'm crazy, you think I'm gone
So what if I'm crazy? All the best people are
And I think you're crazy too, I know you're gone
That's probably the reason that we get along
Now I'm peeling the skin off my face
Cause I really hate being safe
The normals they make me afraid
The crazy they make me feel sane
I'm nuts!
Baby, I'm mad
Craziest friend that you've ever had
You think I'm psycho
You think I'm gone
Tell the psychiatrist something is wrong
Over the bend
Entirely bonkers
You like me best when I'm off my rocker
Tell you a secret
I'm not alarmed
So what if I'm crazy?
The best people are
All the best people are crazy
All the best people are.
You call me on the telephone, you feel so far away
You tell me to come over there some games you want to play
I'm walking to your house, nobody's home
Its me and you, you and me alone
We're just playing hide and seek
It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
I don't wanna play no games
I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you
I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I give a shit 'bout you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you
Wake up in your bedroom and there's nothing left to say
When I try to talk you're always playing board games
I wish I had monopoly over your mind
I wish I didn't care all the time
We're just playing hide and seek
It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you
I don't wanna play no games
I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you
I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I give a shit 'bout you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you
Ring around the rosy
I never know, I never know what you need
Ring around the rosy, I wanna give you, wanna give you
I don't give a fuck about you anyways
Whoever said I give a shit 'bout you?
You never share your toys or communicate
I guess I'm just a play date to you
You know I give a fuck about you every day
Guess it's time that I tell you the truth
If I share my toys, will you let me stay?
Don't wanna leave this play date with you
  Stitched you up, put you together
With cotton and feather
  Gave you love, put my heart inside you
Oh what could I do
When you started talking in your sleep
Saying things you'd do to me
I didn't care
Now I'm finding knives under the sheets
Crumbled photographs of me
I'm in despair
Teddy bear, you are my teddy bear
You were comforting and quiet
How did love become so violent?
Oh, teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
Everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me
  I threw you out, I didn't outgrow you
I just didn't know you
  But now you're back
And it's so terrifying how you paralyze me
Now you showing up inside my home
Breathing deep into the phone
I'm so unprepared
Teddy bear, you are my teddy bear
You were comforting and quiet
How did love become so violent?
Oh, teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
Everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me
I'm fucking scared
Teddy bear, you are my teddy bear
You were comforting and quiet
How did love become so violent?
Oh, teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
Everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me

Your skin is warm like an oven
Your kiss is sugary sweet
Your fingers feel like cotton
When you put your arms around me
It feels like I'm just missing
Something whenever you leave
We've got all the ingredients
Except you loving me
 And respectfully
I'm not a piece of cake
For you to just discard
While you walk away
With the frosting of my heart
So I'm taking back
What's mine, you'll miss
The slice of heaven that
I gave to you last night
You smell just like vanilla
You taste like buttercream
You're filling up my senses
With empty calories
It feels like I'm just missing
Something whenever you leave
We've got all the ingredients
Except you needing me
 And respectfully
I'm not a piece of cake
For you to just discard
While you walk away
With the frosting of my heart
So I'm taking back
What's mine, you'll miss
The slice of heaven that
I gave to you last night
If I am just a piece of cake
I am just a piece of cake
Then, you're just a piece of meat
You're just a piece of meat to me
I'm not a piece of cake
For you to just discard
While you walk away
With the frosting of my heart
So I'm taking back
What's mine, you'll miss
The slice of heaven that
I gave to you last night
The slice of heaven that I gave
S-S-Slice of heaven that I gave to you
The Slice of heaven

Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear.
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare.
See how I leave, with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do.
There's a fire starting in my heart,
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love, remind me of us.
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling...
We could have had it all... (I wish you, never had met me)...
Rolling in the Deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Your had my heart... (I wish you)... Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
And you played it... (Tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (Rolling in the deep)
Baby I have no story to be told,
But I've heard one of you and I'm gonna make your head burn.
Think of me in the depths of your despair.
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared.
The scars of your love, remind me of us.
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling...
We could have had it all... (I wish you, never had met me)...
Rolling in the Deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Your had my heart... (I wish you)... Inside of your hand (Never had met me)

Rolling in the Deep
Your had my heart Inside of your hand
And you played it To the beat

We could have had it all (Tears are gonna fall... Rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all yeah ( I wish you... never had met me)
It all, It all (Rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all... (I wish you, never had met me)...
Rolling in the Deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
Your had my heart... (I wish you)... Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
And you played it... (Tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (Rolling in the deep)

I pushed a lot back, but I can't forget it
We never got the credit
Nobody seemed to hear us, but we said it
Neither of us planned it
And for a long time I took it all for granted
I really thought we had it
But at the time it was more than I could manage
So, if we can leave it all behind us
And meet in between
It would get me so
High all the time, high all the time
I wanna be high all the time

I wish I never ever told you all about it

I never meant to hurt you though
I had all my motives
I didn't know they wouldn't mix with your emotions
I just had to reach my goals
Never knew I need you though, so

Keep on reaching

  I can feel you fade away
  From the kitchen to the bathroom sink and
  Your steps keep me awake
Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down
Down, let me down, down
Let me down
If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving baby let me down slowly
  Cold skin, drag my feet on the tile
  As I'm walking down the corridor
  And I know we haven't talked in a while
  So I'm looking for an open door
Don't cut me down, throw me out, leave me here to waste
I once was a man with dignity and grace
Now I'm slipping through the cracks of your cold embrace
So please, please
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me
If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving baby let me down slowly
Let me down, down
Let me down, let me down

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely
If you're leaving baby let me down slowly

And I can't stop myself from falling     down
And I can't stop myself from falling     down

You never told me being rich was so lonely
Nobody know me, oh well
Hard to complain from this five star hotel
I'm always in a rush, I've been thinking too much but
Keep it on the hush, no one need to know, just us
That's really all it takes

No need for shame, I get more peace at slow speeds
Go beat the game, young control freak
It's cold in my veins, I'm below freezing, snow season (made me)
They know that I so need my space
Don't wanna grow old so I smoke just in case
She say that I glow below the waist
And a stroke is just so PGA
All I got is a little bit of space and time
Drawing shapes and lines of the world we made
Tomorrow may be right around the corner but I swear
It's gon be worth it if I make it, babe

That's why I wrote this song, told myself to hold on
I can feel my fingers slippin', in a motherfuckin' instant I'll be gone
Do you want it all if it's all mediocre
Staring at the wall and the wall's full of posters
Lookin' at my dreams, and who I wanna be
I guess you gotta see it to believe
Oh, I been a fool, but that's cool, that's what human beings do
Keep your eyes to the sky, never glued to your shoes
Guess there was a time when my mind was consumed
But the sun's coming out now, clouds start to move
Don't tell me nothing but the truth
I'm tired, I don't gotta spare a second
Win or lose, win or lose
I don't keep count, nobody checkin'

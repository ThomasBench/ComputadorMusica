Strokin' my face, like that, oh, yes
See, I love how, how your lips feel
Touchin' my skin
Don't have to force it, don't have to be nobody else

You make me forget about all the other shit that I'm goin' through
You make me feel how I should feel
With you, I just have it all
'Cause you are, 'cause you are
Everything to me
Everything to me
You feel like everything I need
You're my everything (You are)
You make me fall so deep again

But how could I possibly rеsist
When you are evеrything, everything to me?
Baby, don't slow down 'cause I love how
You're takin' me places in my mind
See, I love my view from this side
It's my favorite location, ooh
No one can make the day feel like a couple hours the way you do
I know forever wouldn't give me enough time to spend with you
You make me feel how I should feel
With you, I just have it all

3,Getting Older (ver 2),Billie Eilish,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/billie-eilish/getting-older-chords-3813938,"I'm gettin' older, I think I'm agin' well
I wish someone had told me I'd be doin' this by myself
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for
But it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door
Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more
Than anyone before (Anyone before)
 Too bad they're usually deranged
Last week, I realized I crave pity
When I re-tell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest
I was still bein' ignored (Lyin' for attention, just to get neglection)
Now we're estranged
 Things I once enjoyed
 Just keep me employed now
 Things I'm longing for
 Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeird
That we care so much, until we don't
I'm gettin' older, I've got more on my shoulders
But I'm gettin' better at admitting when I'm wrong
I'm happier than ever, at least, that's my endeavor
To keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure
'Cause to be honest, I just wished the word I promised
Would depend on what I'm givin' (Not on his permission)
(Wasn't my decision) To be abused, mm
 Things I once enjoyed
 Just keep me employed now
 Things I'm longing for
 Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeird
That we care so much, until we don't
But next week, I hope I'm somewhere laughin'
For anybody asking, I promise I'll be fine
I've had some trauma, did things I didn't wanna
Was too afraid to tell ya, but now, I think it's time

Soli dietro montagne di vetro

Se non dai ciò che la gente vuole
Se dici troppo in una canzone
Ci si fa male da soli su una terrazza
Chiedi un parere perché il tuo non ti basta
Ci provo a stare senza
Se ti do l’anima che avanza
Dici non è abbastanza per te
Non è abbastanza, è un tuo limite
Vincere non è niente di che
Il successo fa male alla testa
Se pensi di non essere all'altezza
Nel buio guarda tua madre
Ti dirà: ""L'amore è ciò che ti resta""

A golden frame for an aching pain

While outside the flowers bloom
As they would anyway
The sick are brave and extra loving
I'm none of that, I'm just sick and tired
The children play without a warning
The trees are yawning, but then it's quiet
A pouring rain washes away
All its faces flaunt concern
Cause what if it did?
And the storm persists for many years
And I'll spend my days
As though it would, anyways
Sometimes I get choked...
Counting my prayers in a holy sense of disarray
Cause I spend my days
Wishing things could ever change
As if they could, anyways

I don't even know
How are we gonna move on?
Somewhere in between, falling apart
And figuring out what it all still means
Can't just be friends, it hurt way too much
Guess that's just life, you left me with not enough
Pouring my heart into your cup
And every time I think you're done, you come around
Usin' me up, last call, oh
Here's to the tears, yeah, I'm givin' it up
Last call, oh
Cheers to the years
I was pourin' my heart into your cup
Didn't know every time you came around, I ended up
Wasted in love, last call, oh
You've been sleepin', you've been sleepin'
On the weeknight, on the weekend
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Comin' over, barely sober
On the weeknight, always hoping
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Usin' me up, last call, oh
Here's to the tears, yeah, I'm givin' it up
Last call, oh
I was pourin' my heart into your cup
Didn't know every time you came around, I ended up
Wasted in love, last call, oh
Last call, oh

I run from twelve
And take my rage across the county line

I dabble in the past, yeah, I said it
I finally admit it
I told you it was over then I skinny-dipped and did it
I should've known better but I didn't overthink it
And I probably would've floated but I sank it
Took a dive in the deep and forgot to move
Swam with the fish 'til my kiss turn blue
I aired out my sheets 'cause they smell like you
I cleaned out the salt in my wounds

Your ego, never fed it
My legs just caught a cold and so I didn't wanna spread it
You told me if I tried to walk away I would regret it
Maybe if I didn't swim, I would've sweat it
Used to read every story 'bout me and you
Checked out your book, now it's overdue
I tried to return 'cause I'm over you

Say you praise my body

Justified to hold me

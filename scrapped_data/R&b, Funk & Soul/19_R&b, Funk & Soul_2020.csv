Ain't something you sit back and you wait for
Mmm, ah
Confidence
Is throwing your heart through every  brick wall
Mmm, ah

All the trauma's in remission
No, I don't need permission

And I curse my tongue for being mean

Motionless and absolute

Would cower at this small brunette
To my surprise, not six feet high
Would reach and grab the moon if I
Should ask or just imply
That I wanted a bit more light
So I could look inside his eyes
And get the colors just right
Just right, just right, just
Build love, build God, build provinces
Build calluses, break promises
'Cause I could never hold a perfect thing and not demolish it

How could somebody ever love me?

Took my hat off, made me pledge allegiance
Everything was in divine sequence

You tryna ball harder than me?
Cross your mind now and later?
It's just a part of nature
Can we do each other favors?
Would you mind the labor? Baby

Men vinden snudde en annen vei
  Jeg så et bilde av meg selv, jeg var ikke 18 lenger
Noe var forskjellig
Jeg forsto litt for sent at det var ensomhet
Som lente seg på meg
Og det er greit
Plutselig var ingenting på liksom
Skjærer du grimaser kan du bli sånn
Hvor mange av de dagene her har en pris
  Hvor lenge var Adam i paradis
Jeg har hørt at man blir klokere med tiden
- jeg blir mer dust
Det er snickers og twist
Catcher en dårlig dag som ""hvorfor ikke en uke i slengen""
Blir inne i helgen, innpå rommet og maler
Fanden på veggen
Jeg prøvde å sette ned foten, men den ble kald
Ikke hate the player, det ekke lett å spille ball
Jeg føler meg som en stuntmann i en film
  Som prøver å slutte tidlig på jobb
Jeg føler meg som en fugl i labyrint
  Jeg føler meg som en baby i en mammablogg
Jeg føler meg som maursluker i maurtue
Og samtidig som en fyrstikk i et fakkeltog
Jeg er en heliumsballong i en barnehånd
Like før den slipper taket

Skjærer du grimaser kan du bli sånn
Det er så stille i min leilighet, du kan nesten høre en nål falle
Jeg er så lei av å være trist, det suger så balle
Jeg var uheldig og klarte å skli på en banan
Jeg tok meg vann over hodet, som om jeg er dåpsbarnet
Du får ikke solgt meg grønnere gress
  Se hvordan de gjorde Raggen og Cez
Jeg kasta alle kjerneverdiene mine på sjøen
Fucka opp for hjernekjemien og mista gløden
Jeg føler meg som en stuntmann i en film

Non cambi mai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai
Ti sto pensando più dei soldi (cash), ah
A piedi nella mia via, le tue amiche parlano di me
La strada è difficile oggi, ah
Se ti chiedo di ballare, sembro uno sciocco, perché?
Tu, non ci verrai
Preferisci un Panamera o un Panerai?
Ti senti una ragazza cattiva, se lo fai
Il nostro cuore è buono, fuori non lo diresti
Io mi faccio incasinare dalle curve e dai gesti
Tu sei ovunque, fai perdere la testa
Io invece ho solo le collane, ah, ah-ah
Scheletri dentro l'iPhone
Il tuo sguardo resta nei miei ricordi
Mi sono rotta sai, di provare una nuova scossa
E poi, sentire quanto scotta
Ogni goccia d'acqua, sta sera è una lacrima
Tu che ne sai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai
Mi ferirai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai
(Lo sai) Io per te ho già perso la testa
Non riesco manco a respirare (Non cambi mai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai)
Il mio sguardo resta nei tuoi ricordi
Tu lo sai che ormai non sento niente, perché sento troppo
Non capisco mai mai, che quando è troppo è troppo
E ci spero sempre perché so che hai torto marcio
E ci spero finché non sarà di nuovo tutto morto
E mentre mi sporco di mascara queste guance
Piove, vorrei lavare via tutto come dentro il Gange
Ora lascia che sia il tempo a dirti se ho ragione
Lascia che sia tutto questo a consumarti le parole
Mi sono rotta sai, di provare una nuova scossa
E poi, sentire quanto scotta
Ogni goccia d'acqua, sta sera è una lacrima
Tu che ne sai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai

(più del cash, più del grano, più del cash, ehi)
La strada è difficile oggi (Più del cash, più del grano, più del cash, più del grano)
Se ti chiedo di ballare, tu non ci verrai
Il tuo sguardo resta nei miei ricordi
La fama non è tra le cose più care eh
Il mio nome è tatuato sulle altre
Se finisce, allora quanto è importante? eh
 La strada è difficile oggi (Lo sai)

I have always been sincere to you

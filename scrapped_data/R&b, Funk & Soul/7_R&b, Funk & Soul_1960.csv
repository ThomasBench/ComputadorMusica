I THINK I’M RETURNING TO, THOSE DAYS WHEN I WAS YOUNG ENOUGH
TO KNOW THE TRU-TH.
NOW THERE ARE NO GAMES,     TO ONLY PASS THE TIME.
NO MORE COLOURING BOOKS,     NO CHRISTMAS BELLS TO CHIME.
BUT THINKING YOUNG AND GROWING OLDER, IS NO SIN.
AND I CAN PLAY  THE GAME OF LIFE TO WIN.
I CAN RECALL THE TIME, WHEN I WASN’T ASHAMED TO REACH OUT  TO A FRIEND.
AND NOW I THINK I’VE GOT,  A LOT MORE THAN A SKIPPING ROPE  TO LEND.
NOW THERE’S MORE TO DO,     THAN WATCH MY SAILBOAT GLIDE.
AND EVERY DAY CAN BE,      MY MAGIC CARPET RIDE.
AND I CAN PLAY  HIDE AND SEEK WITH MY FEARS.
AND LIVE MY DAYS  IN-STEAD OF COUNTING MY YEARS.
LET EVERY-ONE DEBATE,      THE TRUE RE-ALITY.
I’D RATHER SEE THE WORLD,      THE WAY IT USED TO BE.
A LITTLE BIT OF FREEDOM’S ALL WE LACK,
SO CATCH ME IF YOU CAN,       I’M GOIN’ BACK.

All my faith in you is gone but the heartaches 
linger on.
Take these chains from my heart and set me free.
Take these tears from my eyes and let me see..
just a spark of the love that used to be.
If you love somebody new, let me find a new 
love, too.
Take these chains from my heart and set me free.
Give my heart just a word of  sympathy..(sympathy.)
Be as fair to my heart as you can be..(you can be.)
Then if you no longer care, for the love that's 
beating there..take these chains from my heart 
and set me free.
Take these chains from my heart and set me free,

 But I told them time and time, a-gain;
""Don't you know, I was made to love her?
Built a world all a-round her"", yah! Hey, hey, hey.
She's been my inspiration, showed appreci-ation,
 For the love I gave her through the years.
Like a sweet magnolia tree, my love blossmed tender-ly.
 My life grew sweeter through the years.
I know that my baby loves me, my baby needs me,
 That's why we made it through the years.

 All through thick and thin, our love just won't end.
My baby loves me, my baby needs me,
And I know I ain't going no-where.

 I had the fever with each pa-ssing year.

 By her side, I'll still be standing there.

44,Walk On By,Dionne Warwick,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/dionne-warwick/walk-on-by-chords-259117," If you see me walking down the street,
And I start to cry, each time we meet;
 Walk on by   
Walk on by    make believe,
That you don't see the tears; just let me grieve,
In private, 'cos each time I see you;
I break down and cry   
Walk on by, (don't stop),
Walk on by, (don't stop), walk on by.
 I just can't get over losing you,
And so if I seem, broken in two;
 Walk on by   
Walk on by    foolish pride;
That's all that I have left, so let me hide;
The tears and the sadness you gave me,
When you said good-bye   
walk on by, (don't stop),
Walk on by, (don't stop).
Walk on by, (don't stop), walk on by.
 Walk on by   
Walk on by    foolish pride;
That's all that I have left, so let me hide;
The tears and the sadness you gave me,
When you said good-bye   
Walk on by, (don't stop),
Walk on by, (don't stop),
Now you really gotta go, so walk on by, (don't stop),
Make believe you never see the tears I cry, (don't stop),

0,Ive Lost You,Elvis Presley,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/elvis-presley/ive-lost-you-chords-1722158,"Lying by your side I watch you sleeping
And in your face the sweetness of a child
Murmuring the dreams you won't recapture
Though it will haunt the corners of your mind
I've Lost though you're near me
And your body's still this kind
I've lost you on a journey,
But I can't remember where or when
Who can tell when summer turns to autumn
And who can point the moment love grows cold
Softly without pain the joy is over
Though why it's gone will neither of us know
Oh, I've lost you yes, I've lost you
I can't reach you anymore
We ought to talk it over now
But reason can't stand in for feeling, oh
Six o'clock the baby will be crying
And you will stumble, sleeping to the door
In the chill and solemn gray of morning
We play the parts that we have learned to well
Oh I've lost you, oh, I've lost you
Oh, You won't admit it so
I've lost you on a journey,
But I can't remember where or when no more
Oh, I've lost you yes, I've lost you
I can't reach you anymore
We ought to talk it over now
But reason can't stand in for feeling, oh
Oh, I've lost you yes, I've lost you
I can't reach you anymore
We ought to talk it over now
But reason can't stand in for feeling, oh

Yodel-la-hee, yodel-la-hee, yodel-la-hee-hee-hee
Here I am riding along in this ambulance
To the city jail
Going to jail accused of being a peeping tom
Dammit man, I'm saying
Any man would try to find out if his girl
Was doing, doing him wrong
That's all I was doing there outside her home
Oh, I'm a little old country boy
Just a young'un in my teens
I don't gamble, drink or swear
And she did this to me
Mama said son you're going to fall
For that common cajun queen
She's going to take you for your all
And that's what she done done to me
Yodel-la-hee, yodel-la-hee, yodel-la
Yodel-la-hee, yodel-la-hee, yodel-la-hee-hee-hee

I've been victimized
I'm the victim of a one-sided circumstance
No one's heard my side
And when you hear my side, you'll see the rotten trick

How could she, that I loved, do this to me?
Oh, I'm a little old country boy
Just a young'un in my teens
I don't gamble, drink or swear
And she did this to me
Mama said son you're going to fall
For that common cajun queen
She's going to take you for your all
And that's what she done done to me
Eee-ha!
Lately, she's been acting fishy all the time
Just like tonight
When we kissed goodnight she pulled away from me
So I hid from sight
Out of sight by her door, I heard her give her love
To another guy
I guess the guy must have heard me cry
He rushed to the door
That's when I screamed, ""Oh lord!""
Oh, I'm a little old country boy
Just a young'un in my teens
I don't gamble, drink or swear
And she did this to me
Mama said son you're going to fall
For that common cajun queen
She's going to take you for your all
And that's what she done done to me
Talk about surprised at her, when she screamed to him
It's a peeping tom--then he beat me up
I took the beating but I felt more hurt when she called the cops
Spitting on twelve months!
Twelve months of loving that girl ain't my idea of a peeping tom
So officer, please let me go, 'cause I've done no wrong
Oh, I'm a little old country boy
Just a young'un in my teens
I don't gamble, drink or swear
And she did this to me
Mama said son you're going to fall
For that common cajun queen
She's going to take you for your all
And that's what she done done to me
Oh, I'm a little old country boy
Just a young'un in my teens
I don't gamble, drink or swear
And what they done done to me.
Let this country boy go, officer
Please, now that's all I ask
Take this stick out my back and let me go
I don't need her no more

Oh, I'm a little old country boy

To village ghetto land
See the people lock their doors
While robbers laugh and steal
Beggars watch and eat their meals
From garbage cans
Broken glass is everywhere
It's a bloody scene
Killing plagues the citizens
Unless they own police
Children play with rusted cars
Sores cover their hands
Politicians laugh and drink
Drunk to all demands
Families buying dog food now
Starvation roams the streets
Babies die before they're born
Infected by the grief
Now some folks say that we should be
Glad for what we have
Tell me would you be happy

From the bed I can't get used to
It's these little hours in the dark, I dread
As I spend my first night alone without you
Honey, half of me has gone away
With all the love I learned to cling to
Tomorrow I'll have to find another way
To live the rest of my life alone without you
You taught me how to live
How to be myself and how to give
Oh, but now it's you
Who's given up on giving
You've lost the thing, no one to teach                  
You’re changing and now you're out of reach
And my life tonight
Just don't seem worth living, no, no

Cuz back in school I never liked to
It’s just one of those little things I’m gonna need
As I put my life together now without you

It's the place I've made for you
From matchboxes and cards and dominoes

Waits with all the gates wide open and darlin', I'll be standin' just inside

Before you go walk out on me
Take a look around tell me what you see
Here I stand like an open book
Is there something here you might have overlooked?
'Cause it would be a shame if you should leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be
The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad
And now you say that you've grown tired
You want to be by yourself a while
But it would be a shame if you should go
And find that freedom was a long time ago
I know that you can't stand the chains to bind you
But they just keep on drivin' us apart
And you could go where I could never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from your heart?
So, one more time, for ol' times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest
Please don't throw this moment away
We can forget the bad and take the best
But if you don't have nothing else to say
Let me hold you one more time for ol' times sake
But if you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for ol' times sake

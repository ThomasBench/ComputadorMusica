No, I can't forget tomorrow, when I think of all my sorrow,
When I had you there but then I let you go.
And now it's on-ly fair that I should let you know,      what you should kno – ow.

I can't live, I can't give any  more.

2,Seven Years,Level 42,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/level-42/seven-years-chords-74062,"There's thunder rolling in your eyes
It's raining in your heart
What lies around the corner
You have seen a hundred times
But you never thought anyting like it would happen to you
Baby's gone
He walked out on you
Seven years have come and gone
All that time for you
And now both our hearts must beat the drum
To a different tune
Send all those dreams away baby
You can lose yourself in yourself
Hurt yourself a little more
Turn the key and hate the boy
Forget a soul in distress, leave the real world to others
That's not the way he's coming back ever again
Baby's gone
Now what are you gonna do
Each time I see a love, a love that's dying
I know what I would do, I know what I would do
But you can't see cos your heart's in the way
And it's hurting so bad, and it's hurting so bad
But he's so gone, gone away and you can't find him
Was there ever a day, just one day you were happy
Believe in the power of love, everlasting
To the end of all time, to the end of all time
In a funny way I don't feel sorry getting what you served
Just you remember very well the lessons you have learned
And it's August now, your seven years are gone
All that time for you
Send all those dreams away baby ...(repeat)

3,She Cant Help Herself,Level 42,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/level-42/she-cant-help-herself-chords-3201476,"When she was a baby the world was a picture, One twist of fate took her parents away
  On a highway,  they're not coming home, She's alone
Then strangers ap-peared gave her love that she needed, Over those green hills and so far away
  Like an echo,  in the night she'd scream, In her dreams
    She can't  help her-self,  she can't  help her-self
    She can't help herself crying a-lone But there's so many crying like you
When nearly a woman a friend of the family, Took that a-way that was precious to give
  She pre-tended   nothing happened there, Through the years
    She can't  help her-self,  she can't  help her-self
    She can't help herself crying alone But there's so many crying like you
Now she walks alone down the lane made for lovers, Too scared to open her heart to someone
  Close the door and   push away the pain, once a-gain
    She can't  help her-self,  she can't  help her-self
    She can't help herself crying alone, All her bridges were burned long ago
    She can't  help her-self,  she can't  help her-self
    She can't help herself crying alone But there's so many crying like you
Don't cry, leave a light on the landing hall, Don't cry, there's a rainbow behind that door
Just when you can't take anymore... there'll be someone to help you, To break down the walls
Just when you can't feel anymore... there'll be someone, To help you to even the score
Just when you can't give anymore... there'll be someone, To help you to break down the walls
Just when you can't take anymore... there'll be some-one for sure

You've been singing such a different song, I ain't gonna punch you in the eye
Just 'cause you tell a crazy lie

You've been wasting so much time away, Never seem to get through to you
You've been lazy now it's time to pay Who's gonna be the one to say who's gonna make the move today
I won't stand by ...Asking you questions why ...Not while you say you're too shy to look me in the eye ...
If you were mine,     I'd never need to wipe the smile from my face
It ain't no crime,    What we'd achieve if we stayed in this place
You said once I had a hold on you, And I believed you first time a-round
But now you don't know what you're trying to do So when you turn around and realise
I'm not around to dry your eyes
Then you'll know ...It's crazy to let me go ...You're always the last to know, I'm trying to love you too ...

It ain't no crime,    What we'd achieve if we stayed in this place

But I can't shake the feeling you're searching maybe, For another love to blame
If you were mine,     I'd never need to wipe the smile from my face

The sun will shine again
And the pain, will end

21,Back On Top,Van Morrison,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/van-morrison/back-on-top-chords-610477," You came to see me when the moon was new.
 Saw you standin' in the pouring rain.
 Left my message on the window pain;
 Back on the street a-gain,
 Back on the beat a-gain,
I'm... back on the top, a-gain.
 Saw me climbing to the top of the hill,
 You saw me meeting with the fools on the hill.
 Learned my lesson, and I had my fill.
 Learnt it all in vain,
 Went through it all a-gain.
Now I'm back on the top, a-gain.
 Always strivin', always climbing way be-yond my will.
 Same old sensation; isolation at the top of the bill.
 Always seeming like I'm moving, but I'm really going slow.
 What do you do, when you get to the top and there's nowhere to go?
 Just how I get there will be anybody's guess,
 With all the so called trappings of success.
 Left all the deadbeats on the top of the hill.
 Too busy raisin' Cain,
I'm back on the street a-gain.
I'm... back on the top, a-gain.

22,High Summer,Van Morrison,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/van-morrison/high-summer-chords-610480," By the mansion on the hillside,
 Red sports car comes driving down the road.
And pulls up into the driveway,
 And a story does un-fold.
 She's standing by the rhodo-dendrons,
 Where the roses are in bloom.
Looking out at the At-lantic ocean,
 And in her head she hums this tune.
 Thank god the dark nights, are drawing in a-gain,
 'Cos high summer has got me down.
I'll wait till the end of August,
 And get off this merry-go-round.
 And they shut him out of paradise,
 Called him Lucifer, and frowned.
She took pride in what God made him,
Even before the angels shot him down to the ground.
 He's a light out of the darkness,
 And he wears a starry crown.
If you see him nothing will shake him,
 'Cos high summer has got him low down.
 High summer's got him lonesome,
 Even when he makes the rounds, (makes the rounds).
 There's been no two ways a-bout it;
 High summer's got him low down.
 Checked in to the tiny village by the lakeside,
 Settled down to start a-new.
Far away from the poli-ticians,
 And the many chosen few.
 Far away from the jealousy factor,
 And everything that was tearing him a-part.
Far away from the organ grinder,
 And everyone that played their part.
 And they shut him out of paradise,
 Called him Lucifer, and frowned.
She took pride in what God made him,
Even before the angels shot him down to the ground.
 He's a light out of the darkness,
 And he wears a starry crown.
If you see him nothing will shake him,
 'Cos high summer has got him low down.
 High summer's on the rebound,
 High summer's got him low down.
 High summer's on the rebound,
 High summer's got him low down.
 High summer's on the rebound,
 High summer's got him low down, low down.

 Where did they get the info from?
 Same as before; some so-called friends,
 Who claim to have known me then.
 How come they've got such good memories,
When I can't even re-member last week?
 Got to question where they're coming from,
 What knowledge of me is it that they speak?
So far away, way back when,
The people that claim to have known me then.
 They're not on my wavelength and it's such a shame,
 That they have to play the name game.
The fame game, oh, the name game.
Lord, it's a cryin' shame, Lord, tell me what's to blame?
 Reinvented all the stories they know,
 Give them all a different slant.
 What is it that they're really looking for?
 Just a hobby on the internet.
So far away, way back when,
The people that claim to have known me then.
 They're not on my wavelength and it's such a shame,
 That they have to play the name game.
The fame game, oh, the name game.
Lord, it's a cryin' shame, Lord, tell me what's to blame?
 If they didn't really know me way back,
How can they know me now in any respect?
 It's a pity they don't feel the pain,
That they should pay the price to play, to play...
The fame game, oh, the name game.
Lord, it's a cryin' shame, Lord, tell me what's to blame?
 They're not on my wavelength and it's such a shame,

24,Golden Autumn Day,Van Morrison,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/van-morrison/golden-autumn-day-chords-610479,"Well, I heard the bells ringing,
I was thinking about winning, in this God forsaken place.
When my confidence was well,
Then I tripped and I fell, right flat on my face.
Now I'm standing erect,
And I feel like coming back and the sun is shining gold.
Put a smile on my face,
Get back in the human race and get on with the show.
And I'm taking in the Indian Summer,
And I'm soaking it up in my mind.
And I'm pre-tending, that it's para-dise...
On a golden Autumn day.
On a golden Autumn day.
On a golden Autumn day.
On a golden Autumn day.
In the wee midnight hour,
I was parking my car, in this dimly lit town.
I was at-tacked by two thugs,
Who took me for a mug and shoved me down on the ground.
And they pulled out a knife,
And I fought my way up as they scarpered from the scene.
Well, this is no New York street,
And there's no Bobby on the beat and things ain't just what they seem.
And I'm taking in the Indian Summer,
And I'm soaking it up in my mind.
And I'm pre-tending, that it's para-dise...
On a golden Autumn day.
On a golden Autumn day.
On a golden Autumn day.
On a golden Autumn day.
Who would think this could happen,
In a city like this, among Blake's green and pleasant hills?
And we must remember,
As we go through September, among these dark satanic mills.
If there's such a thing as justice,
I could take them out and flog them, in the nearest green field.
And it might be a lesson,
To the bleeders of the system, in this whole society.
And I'm taking in the Indian Summer,
And I'm soaking it up in my mind.
And I'm pre-tending, that it's para-dise...
On a golden Autumn day.
On a golden Autumn day.
On a golden Autumn day.
On a golden Autumn day.

Here am I encased inside a hollow shell
Life began then was done
Now I stare into a cold empty well
The many sounds that meet our ears
The sights our eyes behold
Will open up your merging hearts
And feed our empty souls
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time
It will be forever
Without despair we will share 
And the joys of caring will not be replaced
What has been must never end
And with the strength we have won't be erased
When the truths of love are planted firm
They won't be hard to find
And the words of love I speak to you
Will echo in my mind

(I got you stuck off the realness)
It wasn't raining yet (yet), but it was definitely (but it was definitely)
A little misty on that warm November night
And my heart was pounding (pounding), my inner voice resounding (who)
Begging me to turn away but I just had to see your face to feel alive
And then you casually walked in the room
And I was twisted in the web of my desire for you (and I was twisted)
My apprehension blew away; I only wanted you
To taste my sadness as you kissed me in the dark
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
And so we finished the Moet (and started feeling liberated)
And I surrendered as you took me in your arms (you took me in your arms)
I was so caught up in the moment I couldn't bear to let you go yet
So I threw caution to the wind and started listening to my longing heart
And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed for such a long long time (and I was lifted)
And for a while I forgot the sorrow and the pain
And melted with you as we stood there in the rain
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Last night, last night I dreamed that I
Whispered the words ""I love you, boy""
And touched you so very
Subtly as we were kissing goodbye
 Pretty baby
 How I'm missing you
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time

Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me

Starry eyed
As you put your hand in mine
It was twilight
On the Fourth of July
Sparkling colors were strewn across the sky
That we just barely touched
While roman candles went soaring above us and baby
Then you put your hand in mine
And we    wandered away
I was trembling inside
But I     wanted to stay (Stay)
Pressed against you there and leave the world behind
On that Fourth of July (Fourth of July)
So starry eyed (So starry eyed)
On the flowery hillside
Breathless and fervid
As it swept over me (Swept over me)
Like the wind through the trees
I felt you sigh with a sweet intensity and baby
Then you put your hand in mine (Hand in mine)
And we   floated away
Delicately lay entwined
In an    intimate daze (Daze)
A crescent moon began to shine (Began to shine)
And I   wanted to stay (Stay)
Tangled up with you among the fireflies
On that Fourth of July (Fourth of July)
Thunder clouds (Thunder clouds)
Hung around (Hung around)
So threateningly (So threateningly)
Ominously hovering
And the sky (And the sky)
Opened wide
Shower-ing
Oh, yeah, yeah
Then you put your hand in mine (Put your hand in mine)
And we   ran from the rain
Tentatively kissed goodnight
And went our separate ways
And I've never truly felt the way that I
Felt that  Fourth of July (Fourth of July)
Truly I have never felt the same inside
Like that Fourth of July (Fourth of July)
Truly I could never feel the same as I

With the weight of the world
That I held deep inside
Life was a winding road
And I learned many things
Little ones shouldn't know
But I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky
And though time's rolled by
Still I feel like that child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon
Funny how one can learn
To grow numb to the madness
And block it away
I left the worst unsaid
Let it all dissipate
And I try to forget
As I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky
And though time's rolled by
Still I feel like that child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon
Nearing the edge
Obvious I almost
Fell right over
A part of me
Will never be quite able
To feel stable
That woman-child falling inside
Was on the verge of fading
Thankfully I
Woke up in time
Guardian angel I
Sail away on an ocean
With you by my side
Orange clouds roll by
They burn into your image
And you're still alive
But I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky
And though time's rolled by
Still I feel like that child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up

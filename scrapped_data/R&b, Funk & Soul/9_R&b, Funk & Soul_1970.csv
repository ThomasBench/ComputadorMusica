Unlocks the heart and souls of you and me
Love will learn to sing your song, yeah

Free to wander past his conscious mind
Love will come and take you home, yeah
          Love is written in the stone
      Do you believe, my friend in what you claim
People of the world all doubt the same
Bringing questions of their own, yeah

In the stone, you'll find the meaning
You're not stand ing tall

Ever touching  all

Time will witness what the old folks say
Getting stronger every day
Strength is, strength is written in the stone

Lies a spark of light that never sleeps
The greatest love you ever known

 Hands can understand.
 Waiting for the chance,
 Just to hold your hand.

42,Si Viaggiare (ver 2),Lucio Battisti,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lucio-battisti/si-viaggiare-chords-2260637,"Quel gran genio del mio amico
lui saprebbe cosa fare,
lui saprebbe come aggiustare
con un cacciavite in mano fa miracoli.
Ti regolerebbe il minimo
alzandolo un po'
e non picchieresti in testa
così forte no
e potresti ripartire
certamente non volare
ma viaggiare.
Sì viaggiare
evitando le buche più dure,
senza per questo cadere nelle tue paure
gentilmente senza fumo con amore
dolcemente viaggiare
rallentare per poi accelerare
con un ritmo fluente di vita nel cuore
gentilmente senza strappi al motore.
E tornare a viaggiare
e di notte con i fari illuminare
chiaramente la strada per saper dove andare .
Con coraggio gentilmente, gentilmente
dolcemente viaggiare.
Quel gran genio del mio amico,
con le mani sporche d'olio
capirebbe molto meglio;
meglio certo di buttare, riparare
Pulirebbe forse il filtro
soffiandoci un po'
scinderesti poi la gente
quella chiara dalla no
e potresti ripartire
certamente non volare ma viaggiare.

With the sunlight in my eyes,
Here I am,  and there's nothing I would rather do,
When I want some peace of mind

As evening starts to fly,
     I want to feel the ocean breeze,
Where the mountains kiss the sky------, y------!
So, come on, down Atlantic Avenue,
 Let the samba take a hold of you,
'Cause, I know, there is  no place like the Avenue,
When that music gets a hold of you
Woh - oh,      drive along to Ipanema,
There's always time to spare,
     Forget the troubles of the world,
When they get to much to bare--------!

Walking by the ocean, here today,       no,
     Pretty soon I've got to leave,
But I know my heart will stay,

It would take forever to get you off my mind
If ever you decide to go
I guess i got a little insecurity
When it's concerning you
I guess i'm just afraid that if you ever leave
I'd be in a messed-up state of blue
And I'd be so lonely
Without you loving me
I know    it's gonna be lonely
Without you giving me every little single thing that i need
Lonely
Whatever's in your kiss, it really turns me on
Till I go right out of my mind
And who could ever resist your accent from Paris
It gets me every time
I betcha that you never knew that in my dreams
You are the star
The only bummer is that you always want to leave
Who do you think you are
Don't you know it's gonna be lonely

I know    it's gonna be lonely
Without you giving me every little single thing that i need

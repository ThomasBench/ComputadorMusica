0,Careless Whisper (ver 4),George Michael,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/george-michael/careless-whisper-chords-1139126,"I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all its sad goodbyes
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So, I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you - oo - oo
  ohh oh
Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So, I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, ohh oh.
           Never without your love
Tonight, the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we'd want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me?   Please stay
And I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
So, I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
      Oh ho
(Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone
(Now that you're gone) Was what I did so wrong?
so wrong, that you had to leave me alone?
Do-waa ahh,  do-waa ahh, do-waa ahh,

1,I Wanna Dance With Somebody Who Loves Me,Whitney Houston,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/whitney-houston/i-wanna-dance-with-somebody-who-loves-me-chords-585203,"    Clocks strikes upon the hour, and the sun begins to fade,
still enough time to figure out how to chase my blues away.
I've done alright up 'til now, it's the light of day that shows me how,
and when the night falls, loneliness calls.
Oh! I wanna dance with somebody, 
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody,
with somebody who loves me. 
Oh! I wanna dance with somebody, 
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody,
with somebody who loves me. 
I've been in love and lost my senses, spinning through the town,
soon or later the fever ends, and I wind up feeling down.
I need a man who'll take a chance,
on a love that burns hot enough to last.
So when the night falls, my lonely heart calls. 
Oh! I wanna dance with somebody, 
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody,
with somebody who loves me. 
Oh! I wanna dance with somebody, 
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody,
with somebody who loves me. 
Somebody who , somebody who,    somebody to love me,
somebody who , somebody who,   to hold me in his arms, oh!
I need a man who'll take a chance,

They'll take us where we want to go

You don't have to change a thing
I love you just the way you are

I'll help you see forever too

  I said don`t mind but what do you mean, I am the one
  Who will dance on the floor in the round
  She said I am the one
  Who will dance on the floor in the round?
  She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene.
  Then ev`ry head turned with eyes that dreamed
  Of being the one,
  Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me, be careful what you do.
And don`t go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me, be careful who you love,
And be careful what you do, `cause the lie becomes the truth, hey
  Billie Jean is not my lover,
  She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
  But the kid is not my son
  She says I am the one,
  But the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights, law was on her side
But who can stand when she`s in demand, her schemes and plans
`Cause we danced on the floor in the round.
So take my strong advice: Just remember to always think twice
She told my baby we danced till three, and she looked at me,
Then showed a photo. My baby cried.
His eyes were like mine.
Can we dance on the floor in the round?
People always told me, be careful what you do.
And don`t go around breaking young girls' hearts
But you came and stood right by me, just a smell of sweet perfume.
This happened much too soon. She called me to her room, hey
  Billie Jean is not my lover,

To the dance floor; As the music dies
 Something in your eyes Calls to mind a silver screen
And all it's sad goodbyes
 I'm never gonna dance again, Guilty feet have got no rhythm,
 Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
Should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
 So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you.  
Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
 To the heart and mind
 Ignorance is kind
There’s no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find
 I'm never gonna dance again, Guilty feet have got no rhythm,
 Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
Should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
 So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you.  
Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we'd wanna say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me?
 I'm never gonna dance again, Guilty feet have got no rhythm,
 Though it's easy to pretend, I know you're not a fool
Should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given
 So I'm never gonna dance again

People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be, so I learned to depend on me
I decided long ago, never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I failed, if I succeed, at least I lived as I   believed
No matter what they take from me they can't take away my dignity
Because the grea----test love of all is happening to me

My friends try and tell me: Find a man of my own.

You used to tell me we'd run away together.
Love gives you the right to be free.
You said, be patient, just wait a little longer.
But that's just an old fantasy.
I've got to get ready, just a few minutes more.
Gonna get that old feeling when you walk through that door.
'Cause tonight is the night for feeling alright.
We'll be making love  the  whole night through
So I'm saving all my love
Yes I'm saving all my love
Yes I'm saving all my love for you.
No other woman is gonna love you more.

There's a phrase that fits

I said; don't mind, but what do you mean; I am the one?
Who will dance on the floor, in the round.
She said; I am the one, who will dance on the floor, in the round.
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene.
Then every head turned, with eyes that dreamed of being the one,
Who will dance on the floor, in the round.
People always told me; be careful what you do;
And don't go around breaking young girl's hearts.
And mother always told me; be careful of who you love;
And be careful of what you do, 'cos the lie becomes the truth.
Billie Jean is not my lover;
She's just a girl who, claims that I am the one.
But the kid is not my son.
She says; I am the one,
But the kid is not my son.
For forty days and forty nights, the law was on her side.
But who can stand, when she's in demand, her schemes and plans?
'Cos we danced on the floor, in the round.
So take my strong advice; just remember to always think twice.
(Do think twice).
She told my baby we'd danced 'till three, then she looked a me,
Then showed a photo; my baby cried; his eyes looked like mine.
Go on dance on the floor, in the round, baby.
People always told me; be careful what you do;
And don't go around breaking young girl's hearts.
She came and stood right by me; then the smell of sweet perfume.
This happened much too soon; she called me to her room.
 Billie Jean is not my lover;
She's just a girl who, claims that I am the one.

Tracy died soon after a long fought ...civil war,
Just after I wiped away his last tear,
I guess he's better off than he--- was before,
A whole lot better off than the fools he left here
I used to cry for Tracy, 'cause he was my only friend,
Those kind of cars don't pass you ...every day,
I used to cry for Tracy, 'cause I want to see him again,
But sometimes, sometimes life ...ain't always the way
        Sometimes it snows in April,
        Sometimes I feel so bad,  ...so bad,
        Sometimes I wish that life was never ending,
And all good things, they say, never last
Springtime was al - ways my favourite time of year,
A time for lovers holding hands in the rain,
Now springtime only re - minds me of ...Tracy's tears,
Always cry for love,   ...never cry for pain

Unafraid of the death that left me hypno - tised,

I often dream of heaven, and I know that Tracy's there,

Maybe one day ...I'll see my Tracy a - gain

Calls to mind a silver screen
And all its sad goodbyes
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm

I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I've been given

Time can never mend
The careless whisper of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But now who's gonna dance with me
Please stay
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I've been given

At a day in your celebration
Cause we all know in our minds
That there ought to be a time
That we can set aside
To show just how much we love you

It couldn't fit more perfectly
Than to have a world party on the day you came to be

How a man who died for good
Could not have a day that would
Be set aside for his recognition
Because it should never be
Just because some cannot see
The dream as clear as he
that they should make it become an illusion
And we all know everything
That he stood for time will bring
For in peace our hearts will sing

Why has there never been a holiday
Where peace is celebrated
all throughout the world
The time is overdue
For people like me and you
Who know the way to truth
Is love and unity to all God's children
It should be a great event
And the whole day should be spent
In full remembrance
Of those who lived and died for the oneness of all people
So let us all begin
We know that love can win
Let it out don't hold it in
Sing it loud as you can

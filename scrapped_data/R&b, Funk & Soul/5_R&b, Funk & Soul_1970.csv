You're a rich girl and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money
It's a bitch girl but it's gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Say money but it won't get you too far,
Get you too far
And don't you know, don't you know
That it's wrong to take what is given you
So far gone, on your own
You can get along if you try to be strong
But you'll never be strong
You're a rich girl and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money
It's a bitch girl but it's gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Say money but it won't get you too far,
Get you too far
High and dry, out of the rain
It's so easy to hurt others when you can't feel pain
And don't you know that a love can't grow
'Cause there's too much to give, 'cause you'd rather live
For the thrill of it all, oh
You're a rich girl and you've gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
You can rely on the old man's money
You can rely on the old man's money
It's a bitch girl but it's gone too far
'Cause you know it don't matter anyway
Say money but it won't get you too far,
Get you too far
You're a rich girl, a bitch girl
Oh, you're a rich, bitch girl, yeah
Say money but it won't get you too far,
Oh, get ya too far
Say money but it won't get you too far,
Oh, get ya too far

singing my life with his words
killing me softly with his song
killing me softly with his song
telling my whole life with his words.
Killing me softly
with his song.
I heard he sang a good song
I heard he had a style
and so I came to see him
and listen for a while.
And there he was this young boy
a stranger to my eyes.
Strumming my pain with his fingers
singing my life with his words
killing me softly with his song
killing me softly with his song
telling my whole life with his words.
Killing me softly
with his song.
I felt all flushed with fever
embarrassed by the crowd.
I felt he found my letters
and read each one out loud.
I prayed that he would finish
but he just kept right on.
Strumming my pain with his fingers
singing my life with his words
killing me softly with his song
killing me softly with his song
telling my whole life with his words.
Killing me softly
with his song.
He sang as if he knew me
in all my dark despair.
And then he looked right through me
as if I wasn't there.
And he just kept on singing
singing clear and strong.
Strumming my pain with his fingers
singing my life with his words
killing me softly with his song
killing me softly with his song
telling my whole life with his words.
Killing me softly
with his song.

Ti regolerebbe il minimo

e non picchieresti in testa
così forte no
e potresti ripartire
certamente non volare
ma viaggiare.
Sì viaggiare
evitando le buche più dure,
senza per questo cadere nelle tue paure
gentilmente senza fumo con amore
dolcemente viaggiare
rallentando per poi accelerare
con un ritmo fluente di vita nel cuore
gentilmente senza strappi al motore.
E tornare a viaggiare
e di notte con i fari illuminare
chiaramente la strada per saper dove andare .
Con coraggio gentilmente, gentilmente
dolcemente viaggiare.

meglio certo di buttare, riparare

e potresti ripartire
certamente non volare ma viaggiare.

Strength where I was torn down.

turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kinda seasick
but the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
as the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
the waiter brought a tray
And so it was  that later
as the miller told his tale
that her face, at first just ghostly,         
turned a whiter  shade of pale
She said, There is no reason
and the truth is plain to see.
But I wandered through my playing cards
and would not let her be
one of sixteen vestal virgins
who were leaving for the coast
and although my eyes were open
they might have just as well been closed
And so it was  that later
as the miller told his tale
that her face, at first just ghostly,
turned a whiter  shade of pale

I'm not trying to indicate my state of mind. 
I turn you on, 
I tell you that I'm laughing just to keep from crying 
Pretty music when you hear it, 
Keep on trying to get near it.
A little rhythm for your spirit 
Oh but that's what it's for 
Come on in, here's the door
And I've seen a sparrow get high 
And waste his time in the sky 
He thinks it's easy to fly 
He's just a little bit freer than I
Now here's a mystery 
And maybe you can help to make it clear to me 
When you're fast asleep 
Then what is it that's lighting up the dreams you see 
Only your tears can't conceal it 
And only your prayers may not reveal it 
You've got soul so you can feel it 
And when you make the scene 
Well you know what I mean 
Hey, I've seen a sparrow get high 
And waste his time in the sky 
He thinks it's easy to fly 
He's just a little bit freer than I
Down here on the ground 
When you find folks are giving you the runaround 
Keep your game uptight 
And if you must just take your secrets underground 
Now politicians are trying to speech you 
Mad colour watchers are trying to teach you
Very few will really try to reach you 
If you're lost in a stack 
That's OK, come all black
Now I'd be the last to deny 
That I'm just an average guy 
And don't you know each little bird in the sky 
Is just a little bit freer than I
Hey ordinary Joe 
Although they say you're just a lazy so-and-so 
What they think is real 
Is nothing but an animated puppet show
So don't let time and space confuse you 
And don't let name and form abuse you 
Let that Big Joe Williams blues you 
In the light of the sun you can see how they burn 
Oh I've seen a sparrow get high 
And waste his time in the sky

Long before the human race
 Something stirred
A vast and timeless source began
Intelligence was born and then
 There was the world
Powers filled the universe
Matter formed and broke the curse
Of nothingness
Love became an ageless soul
Nature reached her highest goal
 And breathed the breath of life
 Everlasting life
Well creatures come from out of sight
 Daylight came from in the night
 And all was good
Life became a Masterplan
Love produced the perfect man
 That's understood
The image of the makers word
Worshipped him with all he had
But then one day
From in the depths an evil seed
Grew and manufactured greed
 That changed the way of life
 Everlasting life
Oh the loving power looked and saw
Inside the heart of man a flaw
 Began to grow
Well, the fires of hell began to burn
And so he sent his chosen son
 To let us know
That love had surely made us all
And hate would surely make us fall
So from the cross
Well he showed the world that dreadful day
That love could be the only way
Or all is lost of life
 Everlasting life
 For life is love
And love is life

I'd put joy where there's never been none

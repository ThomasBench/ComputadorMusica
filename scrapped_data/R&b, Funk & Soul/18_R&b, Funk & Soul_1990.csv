Oh thirty days (thirty days!)
Oh thirty days (thirty days!)

Gonna send out a world wide hoodoo
That'll be the very thing that'll suit ya
I'm gonna see that you be back home in thirty days.
I done talked to the judge in private early this morning
And he took me to the sheriff's office to sign a warrant
Gonna put a false charge again ya (against ya)
That'll be the very thing that'll send ya
I'm gonna see that you be back home in thirty days
Oh thirty days (thirty days)

Baby I'm gonna see that you be back home in thirty days
Gonna put a false charge again ya
That'll be the very thing that'll send ya
I'm gonna see that you be back home in thirty days
If I don't get no satisfaction from the judge
I'm gonna take it to the fbi and voice my grudge
If they don't give me no consolation
I'm gonna take it to the United Nations
I'm gonna see that you be back home in thirty days
Oh Thirty Days! (thirty days)
Oh Thirty Days! (thirty days)

You don't give me no consolation
I'm gonna take it to the United Nations
I'm gonna see that you be back home in Thirty Days!

Any other day I would call
“Baby how's your day?""
but today it ain't the same
every other word is
Uh Huh, Yea Okay,
could it be that you,
are at the crib with anotha lady?
If you took it there,
first of all let me say
I am not the one
to sit around and be played
so prove your self to me,
or the girl that you claim
why don't you say the thangs
that you said to me yesterday?
I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down thats the way it seems
Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
Cause I know how you usually do
When you say everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?
If somebody's there then tell me who
Say my name, say my name
if no one is around you
say baby I love you
if you ain’t runnin’ games

Better say my name!
What is up with this?
Tell the truth, who you with?
How would you like it if
I came over with my clique
Don't try to change it now
Sayin’ you gotta bounce
When two seconds ago
you said you just got in the house.
It's hard to believe that you,
are at home, by yourself
when I just heard the voice
heard the voice of someone else.
Just this question
Why do you feel you gotta lie?
Gettin caught up in your game
when you can not say my name
I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down thats the way it seems
Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
Cause I know how you usually do
When you say everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth?

And oceans of lotions and potions you take to keep that old something or other awake  For what?
What's cute about a little cutie? It's her beauty,    and brains 
Old Father Time will never harm you if your charm still re-mains
After you grow old, baby You don't have to be a  cold baby

  Keep young and beautiful if you want to be loved 
  Don't fail to do your stuff   with a little powder and a puff 
Keep young and beautiful  if you want to be loved 
If you're wise exercise all the fat off
Take it off, off of here, off of there 
When you're seen anywhere with you hat off 
Have a permanent wave in your hair
  Take care of all those charms   and you'll always be in someone's arms

And I         wonder why 
        The ones who care don't      call anymore. My

    We took were hard enough 
And they get         harder now            Even

Don't you         feel alone

I been hangin' around here lately
With my mind messed up
Jumped in my car tried to clear my mind
Didn't help me
I guess I'm all messed up now baby
Soon as I jumped into my ride
Those memories start to play
A song comes on the radio
And there you are baby once again
It's just another sad love song
Rackin' my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
And it's all because of you
Since you been gone
I keep thinkin' about you baby
Gets me all choked up
This heart of mine keeps
Dreamin' of you and it's crazy
You'd think I'd had enough
As soon as I get you out my head
I'm in my car again
Just one request from the radio
I'm back in love sugar once again
It's just another sad love song
Rackin' my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
And it's all because of you     (2X)
Here comes the strings
Then somebody sings
Only takes a beat
And then it starts killin' me darlin'
Only takes one note, I tell ya,
From that radio
It's just
Another
Lonely
Love Song.
It's just another sad love song
Rackin' my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
And it's all because of you     (2X)

and let me benefit from your right?

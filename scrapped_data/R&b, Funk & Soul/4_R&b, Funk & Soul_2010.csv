1,White Ferrari (ver 2),Frank Ocean,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/frank-ocean/white-ferrari-chords-1871795,"Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mind on the road
  Your dilated eyes watch the clouds float
White Ferrari
  Had a good time
  16: how was I supposed to know anything?
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed, we're both so familiar
White Ferrari
  Stick by me
  Close by me (You will find, you will find me)
Is this the slow body?
  Left when I forgot to speak
So I text the speech, lesser speeds
Texas speed, yes
Base takes its toll on me
Eventually, eventually, yes
I only eventually, eventually, yes
I care for you still and I will forever
That was my part of the deal, honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year, White Ferrari
  Good times
In this life, life
In this life, life
One too many years
Some tattooed eyelids on a facelift
Mind over matter is magic
I do magic
If you think about it it's over in no time the best life
    I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
You’re tired of movin', your body’s achin'
We could vacay, there's places to go
Clearly this isn't all that there is
Can't take what's been given
But we're so okay here, we're doing fine
Primal and naked
You dream of walls that hold us in prison
It's just a skull, least that's what they call it
And we're free to roam

Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old
   It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
   Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
   By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
   Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure
Once I was eleven years old, daddy told me,
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was eleven years old
  I always had that dream like my daddy before me
  So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory, just always seemed to bore me
‘Cause only those I really love will ever really know me
Once I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was twenty years old
  I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
  ‘Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't see before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing about everything I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old
Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be 30 years old
I'm still learning about life,
my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me,
some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind,
my brother I'm still sorry
Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month
Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Soon I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me

And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

 My heart, it came to life
 This ain't easy, it's not meant to be
 Every story has its scars 
 But when the pain cuts you deep
 And when the night keeps you from sleeping
 Just look and you will see
 That I will be your remedy
 When the world seems so cruel
 And your heart makes you feel like a fool
 I promise you will see
 That I will be, I will be, your remedy...
 No river is too wide or too deep for me, to swim to you
 Come whatever, I'll be the shelter that won't 
 let the rain come through
 Your love it is my truth
 And I will always love you
 Love you, oh
 When the pain cuts you deep
 And when the night keeps you from sleeping
 Just look and you will see
 That I will be your remedy
 When the world seems so cruel
 And your heart makes you feel like a fool

See how I leave, with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do.

But I've heard one of you and I'm gonna make your head burn.
Think of me in the depths of your despair.
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared.

And your face stays the same
You're ashamed to say you feel relieved
Stay away from your own family
But years from now
If you could make them proud
You could leave the world and feel like you've achieved the things you hoped to do but
Honestly I don't feel ordinary cause I haven't been at home in a while
Tell them that it's only temporary
I'm trying my best to smile
But that's never enough
Cause when you lose the ones you love
You might find it hard to cry
Until it's only you and everybody else has left the room
You might feel what it's like to not know how to feel
You see, my old lady's old man just now left
And there's nothing i can say except this long awaited rest
Is a good thing and all good things must come to an end
It's right in front of me so there's no reason to pretend Except I'm afraid to die
If this were a movie, you'd be taking our kids to school
And I'd be Channing Tatum or somebody sexy
Somebody cool
Years from now
If you could make them proud
You could leave the world and feel like you've achieved the things you hoped to do but

New berry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Got 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds saying Mom's confused
I'm for sure she doesn't wanna learn
But Daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know, what you let 'em see
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Know well like I do

That gray Silverado
You drive it 'cause you have to
Stay up working late at a job you hate
Fix your makeup in a dirty bathroom
All my love in the dark clouds
I know what you gotta do
You got plans, wrapped in rubber bands
And that's the only thing you'll never lose

When you move, I'm moved
When you move, I'm put to mind of all that I wanna be

Shake like the bough of a willow tree

 Its reasoning made lucid and cool
And though it's no improvement
When you move, I move
 You're less Polunin leapin'
 Or Fred Astaire in sequins, honey
  You, you're Atlas in his sleepin'
And when you move, I'm moved
When you move, I can recall something that's gone from me
When you move, honey, I'm put in awe of somethin' so flawed and free

Like you've nothing left to prove

Move like a bird of paradise

 I promise that you'll smile and gon' never leave
Shopping sprees in Paris
Everything 24 karats
Take a look in that mirror
Is it you? Is it you? Is it me? Is it me?
Say it's us, say it's us, and I'll agree, baby
Jump in the Cadillac
Anything you want
You deserve it baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you

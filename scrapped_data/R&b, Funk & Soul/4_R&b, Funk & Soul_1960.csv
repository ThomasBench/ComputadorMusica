My lonely days are over
And life is like a song.
At last          the skies above are blue;
My heart was wrapped in clover
The night I looked at you.
I found a dream that I can speak to,
A dream that I can call my own,
I found a thrill to press my cheek to,
A thrill I've never known.
You smiled          and then the spell was cast,
And here we are in heaven,
For you are mine at last.

As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my Ma-   ma and Papa
Down the road I look, and there runs Mary,
  Hair of gold, and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of  home.
Yes, they'll all come to meet me,
Arms reaching, smiling sweetly,
It's good to touch the green, green grass of  home.
The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary,
  Hair of gold, and lips like cherries,
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home
  Then I awake, and look around me
  At four grey walls that surround me
And I realise, yes, I was only dreaming
For there's a   guard, and there's a sad old Padre
  Arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
Again I'll touch the green, green grass of home.
Yes, they'll all come to see me,
In the shade of that old   oak tree
As they lay me 'neath the green,    green    grass   of home.

I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
And you're the key to my piece of mind
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
And if I make you happy, I don't need to do more
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Oh baby, what you've done to me (what you've done to me)
You made me feel so good inside (good inside)
And I just wanna be (Wanna be)

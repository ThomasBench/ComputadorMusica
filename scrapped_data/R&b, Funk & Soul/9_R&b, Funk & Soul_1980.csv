0,Giving You The Best That I Got,Anita Baker,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/anita-baker/giving-you-the-best-that-i-got-chords-2401405,"      Ain't there something I can give you
In exchange for everything you give to me
Read my mind and make me feel just fine
When I think my peace of mind is out of reach
      The scales are sometimes unbal- anced
And you bear the weight of all that has to be
I hope you see that you can lean on me
And together we can calm a stormy sea
     We love so strong and so unselfishly
     And I tell you now    that I made a vow; I'm
Giving you the best that I got,  baby
     Yes I tell you now, that I made a vow; I'm
Giving you the best that I got, honey
      Everybody's got o-pinions
About the way they think our story's gonna end
Some folks feel it's just a superficial thrill
Everybody's gonna have to think again
     We love so strong and so unselfishly
   They don't bother me      so I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got,  baby
   They don't bother me      said I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got, listen baby
Somebody understands you
Somebody gave his heart to me
I stumbled my whole life long, always
On my own, now I'm home
      My weary mind is rested
And I feel as if my home is in your arms
Fears are all gone, I like the sound of your song
And I think I want to sing it forever
     We love so strong and so unselfishly
     And I made a vow      so I tell you now; I'm
Giving you the best that I got,  baby
     I bet everything    on my wedding ring, I'm
Giving you the best that I got, honey

1,Secret Lovers,Atlantic Starr,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/atlantic-starr/secret-lovers-chords-2648421,"Here we are
The two of us together
Taking this crazy chance
To be all alone
We both know that
We should not be together
Cause if we're found out
It could mess up both our happy homes
I hate to think about us
All meeting up together
Cause soon as I
Looked at you
It would show on my face
Then they'll know that
We've been loving each other
They can never know
No, no, no
We can't leave a trace
Secret lovers, yeah
That's what we are
We shouldn't be together
No, no, no
Because we love each other so
Sitting at home
I do nothing all day
But I think about you
And hope that you're okay
Hoping you'll call
Before anyone gets home
I'll wait anxiously
Alone by the phone
How could something so wrong
Be so right?
I wish we didn't have to
Keep our love out of sight, yeah
Living two lives
But we gotta hang on in there
Or fall
Secret lovers, yeah
That's what we are
Trying so hard to hide the way we feel
Because we both belong to someone else
But we can't let it go
Cause what we feel
Is, oh, so real
So real, so real
You and me
Are we fair?
Is this cruel
Or do we care?
Can they tell
What's in our minds
Maybe they've had secret loves
All of the time
In the middle of making love
We notice the time
We both get nervous
Cause it's way after 9:00
Even though we hate it
We know it's time that we go
So that no one will know
Secret lovers, yeah
That's what we are
Trying so hard to hide the way we feel
Because we both belong to someone else
But we can't let it go
Cause what we feel
Is, oh, so real
So real, so real

    Levant une peau noire ouverte sous le crin
S'avance le palais de cette

that beckon you to sleep. I wish you heartache that leaves
you more of a man, I wish I could be there, but I can't.
I wish you places, that sit so still, where people never ever 
change and never ever will. I wish I could hold you and 
make you understand, I wish I could be there but I can't.
Be good for your momma, cuz she'll need a hand to hold,
and boy she loves you, more than you'll ever know.
There are rhymes and there are reasons, and times when
nothing stayed the same, but you know my love still remains.
I wish you wisdom, I wish you years, I wish you armies
to conquer all your fears. I wish you courage for all that 
life demands, I wish I could be there, but I can't.

were nights when I was never alone. I know I've said it, but
I'll say it once again, I wish I could be there, but I can't...

What started as a whisper, slowly turned into a scream
Searching for an answer, where the question is unseen
I don't know where you came from, and I don't know where you've gone
Old friends become old strangers between darkness and the dawn
Amen omen, will I see your face again?
Amen omen, can I find the place within to live my life without you?
I still hear you saying, all of life is chance
And is sweetest, is sweetest when at a glance
But I live, I live a hundred, hundred life times in a day
But I die a little in every breath that I take
Amen omen, will I see your face again?
Amen omen, can I find the place within to live my life without you?
I listen to a whisper slowly drift away
Silence is a loudest parting word you never say
I put, I put your world into my veins
And now a voiceless sympathy is all that remains
Amen omen, will I see your face again?
Amen omen, can I find the place within to live my life without you?
Amen omen, will I see your face again?
Amen omen, can I find the place within?
Amen omen, will I see your face again?

And if we do?
I'd rather it be with you
Cause at least there will be
Sweet memories
I'm not scared of lions and tigers and bears [oh my]
But I'm scared of [loving you]
I'm not scared to perform at a sold out affair [that's right]
But I'm scared of [loving you]
Am I the only one who thinks it's an impossible task?
Why it don't last? Is that too much to ask?
Why do we love Love, when Love seems to hate us?

Tra il balcone e il citofono ti dedico i miei guai

sag ein kleines stückchen wahrheit
sieh wie die wüste lebt
schaff ein kleines bisschen klarheit
und schau wie sich der schleier hebt
eine wüste aus beton und asphalt
doch sie lebt und öffnet einen spalt
der dir neues zeigt
zeigt das altes weicht
auch wenn dein schmerz bis an
den himmel reicht

Schnell Gefahr aus der dunkelheit
bin ich zum ersten schlag bereit
ich bin der erste der dich befreit
und einer der letzten der um dich weint
und wenn ein lied meine lippen verlässt,

ich hab gewonnen und fast ebenso verlorn
jedoch missen möcht ich nichts
alles bleibt unser gedanklicher besitz
und eine bleibende erinnerung
zwischen tag und nacht legt sich die dämmerung
und wenn ein lied meine lippen verlässt,
dann nur damit du liebe empfängst.

and only half the lights are out
I wonder what these peoples lives
what they might be all about
Do they got a lover?  Could they have a family?
Could they be just as lonesome
as you and me?

         Shout out loud
         Why don't you all
         Just come on out

White lights burnin',
Down an empty avenue
I wonder if their driver

48,Cry,Michael Jackson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/michael-jackson/cry-chords-90411," Somebody shakes when the wind blows
 Somebody's missing a friend (Hold on)
 Somebody's lacking a hero
And they have not a clue when it's all gonna end again
 Stories buried and untold
 Someone is hiding the truth (Hold on)
 When will this mystery unfold
And will the sun ever shine
In the blind man's eyes when he cries
 You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight
If people laugh when they're feeling sad
Someone is taking a life (Hold on)
Respect to believe in your dreams
So tell me where were you
When your children cried last night
Faces filled with madness
Miracles unheard of (Hold on)
Faith is found in the winds
All we have to do is to reach for the truth, the truth
 You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight
And when that flag glows 
There'll be no more wars
And when all cause I will answer all your prayers (Prayers) 
Show the world
 You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)

Pulls me down, turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
and I’m forever excusing your intentions
And I give in to my pretendings
 which forgive you each time
without me knowing
they melt my heart to stone
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I’m the
only one in love, I’m the only one in love
Each and every time I turn around to leave
 I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
but instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear      your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing you’ve burnt my heart to stone
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I’m the
only one in love, I’m the only one in love
Why            do you steal my hand
Whenever I’m      standing my own ground
You build me up      and leave me dead
Well, I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I’m the only one in love
I’m the only one in love

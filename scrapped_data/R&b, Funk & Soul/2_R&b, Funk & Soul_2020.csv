0,One Day,Tate McRae,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tate-mcrae/one-day-chords-2232967,"She stares at her ceiling once again
With a hundred thoughts
Maybe he knows who I am
Actually, probably not
She walks down the hall with her head down low
Scared to meet his eyes
Even when she hears his voice
She's swarmed with butterflies
It's impossible
To get you off my mind
I think about a hundred thoughts
And you are ninety-nine
I’ve understood
That you will never be mine
And that's fine
I'm just breaking inside
He always walks the crowded halls
And is blinded by this light
A girl who keeps her head down low
And never shows her eyes
He's tried to talk to her
But there's no easy way
'Cause every time he raises his voice
She runs away
Oh, it's impossible
To get you off my mind
I think about a hundred thoughts
And you are ninety-nine
I've understood
That you will never be mine
And that's fine
I'm just breaking inside
And one day
Maybe she'll stay
And start to head over his way
And one day
She'll look into his eyes
And instead of breaking
She'll call him mine
One day
He'll grab her by the waist
And force them to meet
Face to face
And one day
He'll look into her eyes
And say that you're my only light
Oh, it's impossible
To get you off my mind
I think about a hundred thoughts
And you are ninety-nine
Maybe there's a chance
That you will be mine
But right now
I'm just broken inside

She was walking in the street, looked up and noticed
He was nameless, he was homeless
She asked him his name and told him what hers was
He gave her a story 'bout life
With a glint in his eye and a corner of a smile
One conversation, a simple moment
The things that change us if we notice
When we look up sometimes
They said I would never make it
But I was built to break the mold
The only dream that I've been chasing is my own
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop
Single mothers waiting on a check to come
Young teachers, student doctors
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run

You'll find that someday soon enough
You will rise up, rise up, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
She's riding in a taxi back to the kitchen
Talking to the driver 'bout his wife and his children
On the run from a country where they put you in prison
For being a woman and speaking your mind

3,September,James Arthur,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/james-arthur/september-chords-3747392,"  I remember when I met you just before September
  You were dancing in the street rocking that pink and leather
  Begged my friend for your number I bet you don’t remember
That’s how we began
  I pursued you for a year I would have waited longer
  I knew ultimately it would make the feeling stronger
  That first time I kissed you I could look in the mirror
And like who I was
I could never wait for the weekends when you would come over
Cause that’s when I’d see you again
You’re all my strength and my weakness
You battle my demons
You’re still undefeated
Sometimes I get a little bit jaded
Too much pressure just to make it
You smile when I’m angry and I hate it
But I’ll still love you for the rest of my life
My crush on you has never faded
Let’s go back to bed until we break it
I’m gonna love you for the rest of my life
Ooh
If you wanted to
  I remember being foolish when I met your mother
  Cause she had that Irish charm right then I knew I’d love her
  That’s where you got your heart
When we got back to the car
I knew you were the one
I could never wait for the weekends when you would come over
Cause that’s when I’d see you again
You’re all my strength and my weakness
You battle my demons
You’re still undefeated

To make it feel like we might be right
We might not be alone
Be alone
""Everybody dies,"" that's what they say
And maybe, in a couple hundred years, they'll find another way
I just wonder why you'd wanna stay
If everybody goes
You'd still be alone
I don't wanna cry, some days I do
But not about you
It's just a lot to think about
The world I'm used to
The one I can't get back, at lеast not for a while
I sure have a knack for seein' lifе more like a child
It's not my fault, it's not so wrong to wonder why
Everybody dies, and when will I?

That even when it's time, you might not wanna go
But it's okay to cry and it's alright to fold

  I forgot you were gone again
And all the words you typed out, I read, uh

  My skin's so soft today
  But you're so far away
And I can go off the memories, uh
Starting to feel like a memory, uh
And I thought we'd be traveling the world together
Making love in the afternoon
But I'm forgetting what it's like to wake up next to you
  You should be here, should be with me tonight

I don't wanna be the one making plans all the time
Asking you what's on your mind
  I know I'm not on your mind
 Scared you're gonna fall behind
Listen, listen, I get it, I get it
 More than anybody, I get it
Life is right now, you tend to forget it
  Looking back, you're gonna regret it

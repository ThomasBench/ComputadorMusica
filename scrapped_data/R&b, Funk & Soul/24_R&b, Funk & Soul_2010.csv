0,Maybe Idk (ver 2),Jon Bellion,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jon-bellion/maybe-idk-chords-1851797,"I wonder why I get paranoid when I'm high
I wonder why I say yes to everyone in my life 
I wonder why I can't run that fast in my dreams
I wonder why I feel short when I know my money's tall
I wonder why I miss everyone and still don't call
I wonder why I can't run that fast in my dreams
Although I guess if I knew tomorrow
I guess I wouldn’t need faith
I guess if I never fell, I guess I wouldn’t need grace
I guess if I knew His plans, I guess He wouldn’t be God
So maybe I don’t know, maybe I don’t know
Maybe I don’t know, maybe I don’t know
But maybe that’s okay
Maybe that’s okay, maybe that’s okay
Maybe I don’t know, maybe I don’t know
But maybe thats okay
I wonder why I feel emptiness and I sing these blues
I wonder why I feel hopelessness when I watch the news
I wonder why I can’t find my voice in my dreams
I wonder why they say hate your brother and hide your gold
I wonder why we all fear the things that we might not know
I wonder why I can’t find my voice in my dreams
Although I guess if I knew tomorrow
I guess I wouldn’t need faith
I guess if I never fell, I guess I wouldn’t need grace
I guess if I knew His plans, I guess He wouldn’t be God
So maybe I don’t know, maybe I don’t know
Maybe I don’t know, maybe I don’t know
But maybe that’s okay
Maybe that’s okay, maybe that’s okay
Maybe I don’t know, maybe I don’t know
But maybe thats okay
All this shit, I can’t explain
Is it by design or random fate, yeah
So maybe I don’t know, maybe I don’t know
Maybe I don’t know, maybe I don’t know
But maybe that’s okay
Maybe that’s okay, maybe that’s okay
Maybe I don’t know, maybe I don’t know

Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kickin' like they 6 months pregnant
Drinkin' Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn, quarter to seven
The sky's getting cold, we flyin' from the North
We're rockin' with our city like a sold-out show
House full of pros that specialize in the hoe'ing
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets, Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split-life livin'
Let the world listen, if a hater's caught slippin'
Then my niggas stay tight, got my back like Pippen
Fast life grippin', yeah we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic, get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get oh so rigid
All that money the money is the motive
All that money the money is the motive
All that money the money she be foldin'
Girl put in work
Girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work
Girl, girl put in work 
Girl put in work
Push it through the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance so when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom closer to the top
The higher that I climb the harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to they credits
So I tell 'em use a debit watch they image start to lessen
I warned them like discretion
Why these niggas testin'
Always fuckin' testin'
Why these niggas testin'
Shit that I got them on straight bar hoppin'
To the music of the ambiance gets shit poppin'
Zombies of the night
Niggas ain't talkin'
If they hypin' to the crew get it in like pockets
Downtown lovin' when the moon comin'

You knew who I was every step that I ran to you
Only blue or black days
Electing strange perfections in any stranger I choose
    Would things be easier if there was a right way
Honey there is no right way
And so I fall in love just a little ol' little bit
every day with someone new
There's an art to life's distractions
Somehow escapes the burning weight the art of scraping through
Some like to imagine
The dark caress of someone else I guess any thrill will do
    Would things be easier if there was a right way
Honey there is no right way
And so I fall in love just a little ol' little bit
every day with someone new
I awake at the first cringe of morning
And my heart's already sinned.
How pure how sweet a love, Aretha, that you would pray for him
Love with every stranger the stranger the better        (repeat 6 times)
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new

Guided by a beating heart
I can’t tell where the journey will end
But I know where it starts
They tell me I’m too young to understand
They say I’m caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don’t open up my eyes
Well that’s fine by me
So wake me up when it’s all over
When I’m wiser and I’m older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn’t know I was lost
So wake me up when it’s all over
When I’m wiser and I’m older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn’t know I was lost
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
And I don’t have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life’s a game made for everyone

And we don't let nobody bring us down

Don't matter if I fall from the sky

Oh, oh, our love is running into a burning building
Oh, oh, our love is scattered ash with a burnt up feeling
Feel the heat so we started running, you know you saw it coming
But the memories are still in my mind, burning like smoke and fire
Rumors spread like wildfire, I held a strong ground
But I've been burning down
Cause it's like fire is all I hear about
And we are fading out
Don't want to turn out the light, but it's like
I'm no firefighter
I just need to breathe tonight
So sound the alarm, and there goes the night
Oh, oh, our love is running into a burning building
Oh, oh, our love is scattered ash with a burnt up feeling
Feel the heat so we started running, you know you saw it coming
But the memories are still in my mind, burning like smoke and fire
Secrets in a small town, they always get around
But the flame has been put out
And I am hearing all the small talk
They whisper as I walk
In a house that's boarded up, so good luck
I'm no firefighter
I just need to breathe tonight
So sound the alarm, and there goes the night
Oh, oh, our love is running into a burning building
Oh, oh, our love is scattered ash with a burnt up feeling
Feel the heat so we started running, you know you saw it coming

Smoke there's fire, smoke there's fire
No, no

‘Til the fever broke
When I awoke
The moon still hung
The night so black
That the darkness hummed

My legs were weak
I prayed my mind
Be good to me
An awful noise
Filled the air
I heard a scream
In the woods somewhere

Ooh-ooh

I quickly ran
Into the trees
With empty hands
A fox it was
He shook afraid
I spoke no word
No sound he made
His bones exposed
His hind was lame
I raised a stone
To end his pain
What caused the wound?
How large the teeth?
I saw new eyes
Were watching me
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
The creature lunged
I turned and ran
To save a life
I didn't have
Deer in the chase
There as I flew
I forgot all prayers
Of joining you
I clutched my life
And wished it kept
My dearest love
I'm not done yet
How many years
I know I'll bear
I found something
In the woods somewhere

Ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh

Big lights, people
Rushing to grow up before you know
Stop signs, denied
Everyone tells me I gotta go slow
And it's gonna hurt sometimes
No matter what you do
But nothing can change my mind
If I'm too young to fall in love
Why do you keep running through my brain?
If I'm too young to know anything
Then why do I know that I'm just not the same?
Don't tell me I won't, don't tell me I can't feel
What I'm feeling is real
Cause I'm not too young
Rain drops, deep thoughts
Pictures of you and me wherever I go
Laughing, running
To a place where nobody says no
And it's gonna hurt sometimes
No matter what you do
But I've got to fall to fly
If I'm too young to fall in love
Why do you keep running through my brain?
If I'm too young to know anything
Then why do I know that I'm just not the same?
Don't tell me I won't, don't tell me I can't feel
What I'm feeling is real
Cause I'm not too young
Cause I'm not too young
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If I'm too young to fall in love
Why do you keep running through my brain?
If I'm too young to know anything
Then why do I know that I'm just not the same?
Don't tell me I won't, don't tell me I can't feel
What I'm feeling is real
Cause I'm not too young
Cause I'm not too young
    I'm not too young   no

Bow your head, they're pious here, but you and I, we're pioneers
We make our own rules, our own room, no bias here
Let 'em sell what they are sellin', there are no buyers here
So gather all the rebels now, we'll rebel rouse and sing aloud
We don't care what they say no way, no way
And we will leave the empty chairs to those who say we can't sit there
We're fine all by ourselves
So ay, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being...

Find me where the wild things are

I'd rather be a wild one instead
Don't wanna hang around the in crowd, the cool kids

My dream's become a song
My days are bright and sunny
Funny why I'm so blue
The man is like a drug
Humiliating and I can't get enough
Love and all it's splendor
Has surrendered it's every blow
Bad is the blues that I know
If this is love what was I thinking
If this is love
What the hell am I, am I gonna do
And that man has got me sinking
To the bottom  of    the   blue
It's what I choose
Love is the baddest blues
The joy versus the pain
No my joy it ain't the same
So I'll put it plain and simple
Just like front page news
Love is the baddest blues
If this is love what was I thinking
If this is love
What the hell am I, am I gonna do
And that man has got me sinking
To the bottom  of    the   blue
Guess that I lose
Love is the baddest blues

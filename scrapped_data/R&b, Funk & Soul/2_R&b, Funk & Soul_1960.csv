0,Save The Last Dance For Me,The Drifters,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-drifters/save-the-last-dance-for-me-chords-14982,"        You can dance every dance with the guy who gives you the eye
        Let him hold you tight.
        You can smile every smile for the man who held your hand
        'Neath the pale moonlight.
        But Don't forget who's taking you home
        And in whose arms you're gonna be.
        So darling, save the last dance for me.
        Oh I know that the music is fine like sparkling wine
        Go and have your fun.
        Laugh and sing but while we're apart
        Don't give your heart to anyone.
        But Don't forget who's taking you home
        And in whose arms you're gonna be.
        So darling, save the last dance for me.
        Baby don't you know I love you so
        Can't you feel it when we touch.
        I will never never let you go
        'Cause I love you oh so much.
        You can dance, go and carry on 
        Till the night is gone and it's time to go.
        If he asks if you're all alone can he take you home
        You must tell him no.
        But Don't forget who's taking you home
        And in whose arms you're gonna be.
        So darling, save the last dance for me.
        But Don't forget who's taking you home
        And in whose arms you're gonna be.
        So darling, save the last dance for me.

1,When A Man Loves A Woman,Percy Sledge,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/percy-sledge/when-a-man-loves-a-woman-chords-84922,"When a man loves a woman,   can't keep his mind on nothing else
  He'll trade the world for the good thing he's found
If she's bad he can't see it      she can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down
When a man loves a woman, spend his very last dime
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comfort, sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way it ought to be
Well, this man loves a woman
  I gave you everything I had
  Tryin' to hold on to your heartless love
Baby, please don't treat me bad
When a man loves a woman, down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she plays him for a fool, he's the last one to know
Lovin' eyes can never see
When a man loves a woman, he can do her no wrong
He can never hug, some other girl
Yes, when a man loves a woman,    I know exactly how he feels
Coz baby baby baby you're my world
When a man loves a woman,    I know exactly how he feels

always moving and going nowhere.

Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down

He'd give up all of his comforts, and sleep out in the rain
If she says that's the way it ought to be
Well this man loves you, woman
I'll give you everything I can

Baby, please don't treat me bad

She can bring him such misery
If she plays him for a fool, he's the last one to know
Loving eyes can never see
When a man loves a woman, he can do her no wrong,
He can never hold another girl

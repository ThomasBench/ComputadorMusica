0,Best Days,Alessia Cara,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/alessia-cara/best-days-chords-3885146,"  So much harder to be honest
  With yourself at twenty-something
  Wish I knew what I'm becoming
And felt the ground while I was on it
Hoping, waiting on a moment
Not knowing if it's coming or it's going
Mmm-mm-mm mm
What if my best days are the days I've left behind?
And what if the rest stays the same for all my life?
I'm running with my eyes closed, so it goes
You live and then you die
But the hardest pill to swallow is the meantime
Are the best days just the ones that we survive?
Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
  If I had known to feel the firе (fire)
  I would've thrown my arms up higher (highеr)
  Would've held on a little tighter
'Cause you don't know a thing you miss 'til it's behind you
Mmm-mm-mm mm-mmm
What if my best days are the days I've left behind?
And what if the rest stays the same for all my life?
I'm running with my eyes closed, so it goes
You live and then you die
But the hardest pill to swallow is the meantime
Are the best days just the ones that we survive?
Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
What if my best days are the days I've left behind?
And what if the rest stays the same for all my life?
What if my best days are the days I've left behind?
And what if the rest stays the same for all my life?

I want to be lost in you, but not in this way
I don’t think you quite understand who you have on your hands
How can you not see just how good for you I am?
I know that you've been hurt before, that's why you feel so insecure
I begged you to let me in ’cause I only want to be the cure
If you don't choose to grow, we ain't ever gonna know
Just how good this could be
I really hope that this would go somewhere
Complacency is the worst trait to have, are you crazy?
You ain't never had, ain't never had a woman like me
It is so sad a man likе you could be so lazy
Consistency is the gift to givе for free and it is key
To ever keep, to ever keep a woman like me
All you do is complain about decisions you make
How can I help lift you if you refuse to activate the life that you truly want
I know it's hard, but it's not
We come from the same place, but you will never give it up
It's where they make you feel powerful, that’s why you think I make you feel small
But that’s your projection, it's not my rejection
I put my heart on the line for the very first time
Because you asked me to and now you’ve gone and changed your mind
But lovin' you was a breakthrough
I saw what my heart can really do
Now some other man will get the love I have for you
'Cause you don't care, oh-oh-oh

And you say that you're not worth it
You get hung up on your flaws

I will always want the same you, same you
Swear on everything I pray to
That I won't break your heart
I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me
And your love is all you owe me
And I won't break your heart

Oh, I could sleep wherever next to you, next to you
And we, we got places we both gotta be
But there ain't nothing I would rather do
Than blow off all my plans for you
And you say that you're not worth it
And get hung up on your flaws

Time before the night

Wrapped inside a bedsheet
Playing with your hair
Watching people on high street

I would make this moment last for hours
If I had my way
Time would just stand still
Wait for me until
I find some magic film
To take a photograph and live inside

Your skin is like a painting
Light is perfect now
I can feel it changing
Kids are probably soon

We're all food for the bloodsuckers
Movin' up under the moonlight
Like the vampires
They can tell that your mind is a mess
Take someone you don't even like to your bed
When it's over, you roll out
You come down the stairs and there's no sound
The party vanished into thin air, just like a ghost town
Your best friends weren't even there
And the whole time, you realized you don't even care
When the alarms strikes seven, light pourin' on your feather-white
Bed of white lies, last night was a set up
Are we dead? Is this really red wine?
Were you feeling left out? Yeah
Take me back when I'm feelin' stressed out
'Cause it’s nearing that time
I only showed up to tell you
Everyone at this party's a vampire
This ain’t red wine
We're all food for the bloodsuckers

Che aveva un'ala rotta e l'anima di vetro

Io quasi sento il tuo respiro su di me
Tu non mi baci mai se non lo faccio io
Scappi un po' dal tuo umore, se vuoi ti presto il mio
Se questo non è amore, di certo ci somiglia
Perché pensiamo troppo, ma il cuore non si sbaglia

Io sogno di esser gocce d'acqua per te

I wish someone had told me I'd be doin' this by myself
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for
But it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door
Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more
Than anyone before (Anyone before)
 Too bad they're usually deranged
Last week, I realized I crave pity
When I re-tell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest
I was still bein' ignored (Lyin' for attention, just to get neglection)
Now we're estranged
 Things I once enjoyed
 Just keep me employed now
 Things I'm longing for
 Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeird
That we care so much, until we don't
I'm gettin' older, I've got more on my shoulders
But I'm gettin' better at admitting when I'm wrong
I'm happier than ever, at least, that's my endeavor
To keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure
'Cause to be honest, I just wished the word I promised
Would depend on what I'm givin' (Not on his permission)
(Wasn't my decision) To be abused, mm
 Things I once enjoyed
 Just keep me employed now
 Things I'm longing for
 Someday, I'll be bored of
It's so weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeird
That we care so much, until we don't
But next week, I hope I'm somewhere laughin'

Are spinnin' 'round-'round-'round
 I know you got demons from the past
Slowin' you down-down-down
But you don't answer your FaceTime
You never had much of a poker face
 It doesn't make you less of a man
You're just human right now
 When I'm afraid of the world, when every part of me hurts
You don't know how many times you've saved me
 So why you hiding from me, it's only making it worse
I just want to be close, my baby
 Give me your pain, I'll take the weight off your shoulders
Don't be afraid, fall into me, let me hold you
We weren't made to hold back the rain from the sky
  Who ever told you that boys don't cry, boys don't cry?
Hate it when you shut me out
Acting like it's your shit to figure out
Don't want to discuss
 Now I'm in my head
About what's in your head
Come back to bed
Can we talk about it?
It's not stupid, it's not drama
It's just trauma turned to armor
Keeping you from me, no performing
If you love me, come and touch me (Yah)
 When I'm afraid of the world, when every part of me hurts
You don't know how many times you've saved me
 So why you hiding from me, it's only making it worse

Is this a lasting treasure 
Or just a moment's pleasure? 
Can I believe the magic of your sighs? 
Will you still love me tomorrow? 
Tonight with words unspoken 
You say that I'm the only one 
But will my heart be broken 
When the night meets the morning sun? 
I have to know... that your love 
Is a love I can ... be sure of, 
So tell me now, and I won't ask again  
Will you still love me tomorrow?

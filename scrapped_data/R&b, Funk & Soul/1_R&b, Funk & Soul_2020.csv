0,Easy On Me,Adele,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/adele/easy-on-me-chords-3911342,"There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washing my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in
Go easy    on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn’t get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy on me
There ain't no room
For things to change
When we are both so deeply
Stuck in our ways
You can't deny
How hard I have tried
I changed who I was
To put you both first
But now I give up
Go easy    on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn’t get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy      on me
I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn't even show
Go easy    on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn’t get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy on me

Last week, I realized I crave pity
When I re-tell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest
I was still bein' ignored (Lyin' for attention, just to get neglection)

Just keep me employed now

To keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure

How you said there was nobody else

You guys always left me out
I still have the letter you wrote when you told me
That I was the only girl you'd ever want in your life
I guess my friends were right

Somebody saw you with her last night
You gave me your word, ""Don't worry 'bout her""
You might love her now, but you loved me first
Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are

How could you be so reckless with my heart?
You check in and out
Of my heart like a hotel
And she must be perfect, oh well

Life is short with temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a jetski
I know the spots that go the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you 
Bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds (Uh)

Have it all
Rip our memories off the wall
All the special things I bought
They mean nothing to me anymore
But to you
They were everything we were
They meant more than every word
Now I know just what you love me for
Take all the money you want from me
Hope you become what you want to be
Show me how little you care
How little you care, how little you care
You dream of glitter and gold
My hеart's already been sold
Show you how little I care
How littlе I care, how little I care
My diamonds leave with you (Mhmm)
You're never gonna hear my heart break (Mhmm)
Never gonna move in dark ways (Mhmm)
Baby, you're so cruel
My diamonds leave with you (Mhmm)
Material love won't fool me (Mhmm)
When you're not here I can breathe (Mhmm)
Think I always knew
My diamonds leave with you (Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds, diamonds)
Shake it off
Shake the fear of feeling lost
Always me that pays the cost
I should never trust so easily
You lied to me, lie-lied to me
Then left with my heart 'round your chest (Mhmm)
Take all the money you want from me
Hope you become what you want to be
Show me how little you care
How little you care, how little you care
You dream of glitter and gold

Show you how little I care
How littlе I care, how little I care

Woahhh
I made my fair share of mistakes
I've had my fair share of bad breaks
I met the real, I met the fake

 Bring the 7
 Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
 Whatever, together
Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it
Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it
Then watch us chase it
With a handful of pills, no chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
And she bad and her head bad
Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
 And it's half-past six
 Read skies 'cause time don't exist
 But when the stars shine back to the crib
 Superstar lines back at the crib
 And we can test out the tables
 We got some brand new tables
 All glass and it's four feet wide
 But it's a must to get us ten feet high
 She give me sex in a handbag
 I get her wetter than a wet nap
 And no closed doors
 So I listen to her moans echo
 ""I heard he do drugs now""
 You heard wrong, I been on it for a minute
We just never act a fool, that's just how we fuckin' live it
And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it
 Yeah, I'm always on that okey dokey
 Them white boys know the deal, ain't no fuckin' phony
 Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
 Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me
 ""Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?""
 ""She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony""
 I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story
 Yeah, I'm talking 'bout you, man, get to know me
 Ain't no offense, though, I promise you
 If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
 But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
 And we could turn this to a nightmare: Elm Street

Didn't realize how it wasn't fair to compare
All the things I know that I've been through
As if you didn't have anything that you went through
I treated you like medicine, but I guess I wasn't listening
And you tried to explain that you had hurt and pain, too
But as long as I felt better, then it was all good
But we wasn't good, so convinced that things were understood
Meanwhile, I had baggage to unpack, and I just had to admit that
Still dealing with the battles, feeling so inadequate
And I know that I shoulda stayed
And I know that you probably thinking
But you still playing in my head to this day talking 'bout, oh

Sangria in a canteen, talking to myself

Daydreams of the romance, daydreams of you

Getting married in a courthouse, writing vows in a rush
Making out before the judge, with my teenage wife
Got a wedding band done that I just might die with
It's an American wedding

Attention, she praises 
She prays to be

The light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain 
And cut her woes away

After their face is made
But there's a hope 
That's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful 
Just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, 
We're stars and we're beautiful

And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful,

covergirls eat nothing she says

""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I could go a little while longer,"" 
She fades away
She don't see her perfect, 
She don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface

Help you see a little bit clearer
The light that shines within

  To bait us with salvation
But no one, no nobody

To rise

Serves now to define our cold society

I won't say a word
They’ve all been said before you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what's coming next
Or scared of having nothing left
Look don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?
Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way    we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is
this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamed this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall
Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
When worlds collide, and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
Where you go I go,
I know I'll never be me, without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together

go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
once I was Seven years old
It was a big big world,
but we thought we were bigger.
we were learning quicker.
By eleven smoking herb
and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure
Once I was eleven years old,
my daddy told me,
go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely.
Once I was eleven years old
I always have that dream
like my Daddy before me
I started writing storys
Something about the glory,  
just always seemed to bore me,
will ever really know me
Once I was twenty years old,
my story got told,
before the morning sun, when life was lonely.
Once I was twenty years old
I only see my goals,
I don't believe in failure.
they can making major,
I got my boys with me at least those in favour
and if we don´t see before I leave,
I hope to see you later.
Once I was 20 years old
my story got told
I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old
Soon we´ll be 30 years old
our songs have been sold
and we´re still rolling
Soon we´ll be 30 years old
I´m still learning about life
my woman brought children for me
and I can tell them storys
Most of my boys are with me
some are still out seeking glory
my brother I´m still sorry
Soon I´ll be 60 years old
my daddy got sixty-one
remember life and then your life
becomes a better one
I make the man so happy
when I wrote the letter once
I hope my children come and visit
Soon I´ll be 60 years old
when I think the world is cold
when I have a lot of children
who can bore me
Soon I´ll be 60 years old
Soon I´ll be 60 years old
when I think the world is cold
who can bore me
Soon I´ll be 60 years old

0,In A Womans Eyes,Tom Jones,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tom-jones/in-a-womans-eyes-chords-3843305,"A man can reach the top, suddenly he'll drop
And to the world, he may not mean a thing
But in a woman's eyes, oh baby, in a woman's eyes
He still means everything
He may not find a friend who'd ever stand by him
His faults are there for all the world to see
But in a woman's eyes, yes darlin', in a woman's eyes
He's everything a man should be oh yes
A woman's eyes are blind to faults the world may find
And she'll stand by, whatever comes along
Oh baby, a woman's eyes can see the good the world can't see
And she believes her man can't do no wrong
Oh, people, let me tell you know
Although my life, it seems, falls short of all my dreams
Her love is there for all that I really need
Cause in a woman's eyes, oh baby, in a woman's eyes
I'm everything a man should be
I'm everything a man should be
Come on baby, I'm everything a man should be

Someone's got to lose
That the way it's got to be
I guessed that it's so
I'd really like to know
But why does the loser
Always have to be me?

Someone's love will end
It's as simple as ""ABC""
It's not really new
Somebody has to lose
But why does the loser
Always have to be me?
I don't ask much
Just let lady luck touch me one time
And maybe then, I will bring back
The love that were mine

He doesn't look like a movie star, oh no
He doesn't drive a Cadillac car
He sure ain't the boy I've been dreaming of
But he's sure the boy I love
Let me tell ya now
He'll never be a big businessman, oh no
He always buys on the installment plan
He sure ain't the boy I been dreaming of
But he's sure the boy I love
When he holds me tight
Everything's right
Crazy as it seems
I'm his, whatever he is
And I forget all of my dreams
And everybody knows
He doesn't hang diamonds 'round my neck, Oh no
But all he's got's an unemployment check
He sure ain't the boy I been dreaming of
But he's sure the boy I love, let me tell you now
I love him, I love him so
I love him never let him go
I love him, I love him so
He's sure the boy I love, everybody knows

I love him never let him go

Let the tears fall down, boom de boom, boom boom
I run to the room, turn on the faucet, I let the water run
Won't let them see what she has done
Let the water run down, let it run, let it run
Let the tears fall down, boom de boom, boom boom
So I lock the door and look in the mirror
I don't like what I see
Crying all those tears at me... oh oh
Let the tears fall down, boom de boom, boom boom
I hear them waiting by the door,
They're yelling are you coming out
All I need is one more minute more
And this is what I'll say.......
I'm alright, ........ I'm alright, ...... I'm alright, .... I'm alright
Let the tears fall down, boom de boom, boom boom
So I reach for the towel, I wipe my eyes
I go out to join the crowd
And my heart is crying out loud.... oh, oh
Let the tears fall down, boom de boom, boom boom
Let the tears fall down, boom de boom, boom boom

Don't let the small town rumours
End our first real romance,
Now I'll admit I've loved a few,
But there was never one like you,
So Darlin', don't believe the things they say.

I threw away the numbers
of those old flames of mine,
And now they're tryin' to put you wise,
Knock me down in my girl's eyes,

Let it out let it all begin
Learn how to pretend
     Once a story's told it can't help but grow old
Roses do lovers too, so cast
Your seasons to the wind
And hold me dear, oh hold me dear
Close the window calm the light and it will be alright
No need to bother now, let it out let it all begin
All's forgotten now
We're all alone, oh we're all alone
Close the window calm the light and it will be alright
No need to bother now, let it out let it all begin
Owe it to the wind my love

Seven rooms of gloom.
 I live with emptiness, without your tenderness.
You took the dream I had for us; turned my dreams into dust.
I watch the phone; never rings, I watch the door that never rings.
Bring you back into my life; turn this darkness into light.
I'm all a-lone in this house, turn this house into a home.
 I need your touch to comfort me,
 The tender, tender arms, that once held me.
Without your love, your love in-side,
This house is just a place to run and hide.
      Seven rooms,
Seven rooms of gloom.
 Rooms of emptiness, without your tenderness.
Don't make me live from day to day, watching the clock that ticks a-way.
Another day, another way, another reason for me to stay.
I need you here, here with me, I need you darling, desperate-ly.
I'm all alone, all alone, in this house that's not a home.
 I miss your love, I once had known.
 I miss your kiss, that was my very, very own.
 Empty silence, sur-rounding me,
Lonely walls, they stare at me.
 I live with emptiness, without your tenderness.

And in a special way you touched my heart with all your charms
And now you're gone
Oh and I find myself, honey, I'm all alone
And there's no love left to take
Don't know where I fell, for you I've always cared 
I did all I know to win your love and make it so
You'd always stay but you turned away
Honey, what could I say?
How could you, how could you,
How could you do me this way?
'Cause I'm chained to your love and affection
'Cause I'm chained; oh your love's my only direction
Oh oh oh oh ah ah ah
I've got to make it right, somehow it's always wrong
Somewhere down the line
The love I've lost I've got to find, yeah
But it won't be long
I'm gonna make it right, baby
And carry you tenderly back home
'Cause I'm chained to your love and affection
'Cause I'm chained; every time I hear your name I tremble
I tremble, oh you know, oh you know
Well, now I admit that I
Haven't been the perfect guy
For a girl as sweet as you
But my heart and soul cries, How do you?
Oh, that's all I need
Oh, gonna make it right, baby
If you just stay, stay with me
'Cause I'm chained
Oh I'm chained to your love and affection
Yes I'm chained

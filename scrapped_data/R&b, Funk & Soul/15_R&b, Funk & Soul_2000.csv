0,So High,John Legend,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-legend/so-high-chords-511586,"Baby since the day you came into my life
You made me realize that we were born to fly
You showed me everyday new possibilities
You proved my fantasies of love could really be
Let's go to a place only lovers go
To a spot that we've never known
To the top of the clouds we're floating away yeah
Ooh this feels so crazy
Oh this love is blazing
Baby we're so high
Walking on cloud 9
Maybe later we can go up to the moon
Or sail among the stars before the night is through
And when morning comes we'll see the sun is not so far
And we can't get much closer to God than where we are

Jealousy and lies within me

And I gotta to know right now
Will I be rich, have everything I want
I stop myself and look to the sky
Oh I got to give myself up to the sky
The only truth is in the sky
Nobody else can tell cause Im stuck in a spell
Oh I tried I tried I tried to rise above it
But it comes right back
Double time
This can't be my fate
I wake up holding on to this pain
And there's nothing else I can do
But 2 give myself up to the sky
Save me.  Take me 2 the,  2 the sky
Save me.  Take me,  take me,
2 the sky
Oh, it's so wrong out here,
I need the sky
So cold out here.  Come and save me,
I need 2 fly.

Hey why me and why not me?
When you're down on your knees
Look 2 the sky
Just look 2 the sky

Or no bigger house
All u really need is friends and love
Hey come on home
Just throw up your hands
Throw up your heart
All u really need is love
Im comin home

Like I tied a piece of string round my finger
And I hope this will remind me
Of the places I have been through
When I'm down, down, down
When I'm down, down, down
Every now and then, when I'm feeling lonely
I turn on my radio
Because I'm hoping that you're out there
It seems so long ago, I would see your writing
On a postcard or a note
And your stories would excite me
When I was down, down, down
When I'm down, down, down
Wherever you stop along the way
I hope that the wind blows you
Back into my life
At the end of the road
And if I'm only dreaming
Then won't you tear the curtains down
And let the light back
Into this empty room
Kissing in your room, climbing out the window
Trying not to make a sound, but with my first love on my mind
You see, we were never through, I never said I loved you
Even when we said goodbye, I never thought it was the last time
Deep down, down, down
And I'm down, down, down
Wherever you stop along the way
I hope that the wind blows you
Back into my life
At the end of the road
Still, every now and then
I hear a voice singing to me softly
Deep inside my head
And it sings till I fall asleep
If I'm only dreaming
Won't someone tear the curtains down
Tear the curtains down
Every now and then, I get a feeling
Like I've left something behind
But I don't know what it is yet
Every now and then, when you're feeling lonesome
Just sing this melody
And remember where you're going
When you're down, down, down
When you're down, down, down
When you're down, down, down
When you're down down, down, down
When you're down, down, down, down, down
Oh I say ohh, ohh, ohh.

  Sometimes I comb my hair and sometimes I won't
Depend on how the wind blows I might even paint my toes
It really just depends on whatever feels good in my soul
I'm not the average girl from your video and I ain't built like a supermodel 
But I learned to love myself unconditionally, because I am a queen
I'm not the average girl from your video, my worth is not determined by the price of my clothes
No matter what I'm wearing I will always be the india arie
When I look in the mirror and the only one there is me
Every freckle on my face is where it's supposed to be
And I know our creator didn't make no mistakes on me
My feet, my thighs, my lips, my eyes, I'm lovin' what I see
Am I less of a lady if I don't wear pantyhose?
My mama said a lady ain't what she wears but what she knows
But, I've drawn a conclusion, it's all an illusion, confusion's the name of the game
A misconception, a vast deception, something's gotta change
But don't be offended,  this is all my opinion, ain't nothing that I'm saying' law
This is a true confession of a life learned lesson I was sent here to share with y'all
So get in where you fit in, go on and shine, clear your mind, now's the time
Put your salt on the shelf, go on and love yourself, cuz everything's gonna be all right
Keep your fancy drinks and your expensive minks, I don't need that to have a good time
Keep your expensive car and your caviar, all I need is my guitar
Keep your Kristal and your pistol, I'd rather have a pretty piece of crystal
Don't need your silicone, I prefer my own, what God gave me is just fine

 On your way down      from the clouds
Would   you   hear   me   if   I   told you
That my heart is           with you now    
Did you find what you were after    
The pain and the laughter      brought  You to your knees
But    if     the    sun   sets you free         
 sets   you   free             You'll  be   free   indeed 
Every time I hear you laughing  
I hear you laughing     It makes me cry
Like    the     story  of    life

  I bust the windows out ya car after I saw you laying next to her
I didn't wanna but I took my turn, I'm glad I did it cause you had to learn
I must admit it helped a little bit
To think of how you felt when you saw it
I didn't know I had that much strength
But I'm glad you see what happens when
You see can’t just play with people’s feelings
Tell them you love them and don’t mean it
You’ll probably say that it was juvenile
But I think that I deserve to smile
  I bust the windows out ya car, you know I did it cause I left my mark
Wrote my initials with the crowbar, and then I drove off into the dark
  I bust the windows out ya car, you should feel lucky that that’s all I did
After five whole years of this bullshit, gave you all of me and you played with it
I must admit it helped a little bit

I had to do something to make you hurt, yeah

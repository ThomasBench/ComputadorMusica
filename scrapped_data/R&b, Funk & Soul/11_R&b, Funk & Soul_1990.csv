Naive in every way
Every schoolboy's fantasy she was
That's why he had 2 wait
If he poured his heart into a glass and offered it like wine
She could drink and be back in time 4 the morning papers
They could take a walk down the ocean side
Make a wish on every wave
They could find a carousel and ride
Or kiss in every cave
They could contemplate the entire universe or just one star
Oh, just how far was the walk 4 the morning papers?
Why is age more than a number when it comes 2 love?
Should we ask the ones who speculate
When they don't know what it's made of?
Should we ask the moonlight on your face
or the raindrops in your hair?
Or should we ask the man who wrote it there in the morning papers?
Should we ask the moonlight on your face or the raindrops in your hair?
Should we ask the man who wrote it there in the morning papers?

I walk down alone
Searching for a light
Your light to lead me home
  Leave a candle in the window
And let it shine for me

When you talk to me  in that sensual tone
It envelopes me  and I lose  my self-control
And baby, I just melt away
Fall like rain
Every time I see your face, I go off (I go off)
I just wanna break it down
Anytime you come around
And baby, I could melt away in your arms
Imagining that you’re taking it slow
And so tenderly, ‘til the feeling overflows
When you look at me, I go soft and cave in
And I can’t conceal that I’m slowly weakening
And baby, I just melt away

Every time I see your face, I go off (I go off)
I just wanna break it down
Anytime you come around
And baby, I could melt away in your arms
You and me in a cloud of reverie
Spin around inside my head unendingly
Thoughts run wild as I sit and rhapsodize
Paint pretty pictures of what I'd do if you were mine
And baby, I just melt away

And hold me and send me    deep   in your heart.

Whenever I was down
You were always there to comfort me

You showed me right from my wrong
Yes you did
And you took up for me
When everyone was downin’ me
You always did understand
You gave me strength to go on
There was so many times
Looking back when I was
So afraid, then you would
Come to me and say to me
I can face anything
And no one else can do what you have done for meh

  Learn to know your side
Shall we commit   our own genocide
Before you check out your mind?

Keep peace with me and I with you
 Let me love in my own way

My tongue is sealed within my mouth
These certain words they can't come out
These thoughts are walking on their own
Dancing around with no control
  I know what I did to you was wrong
  Hence why I've kept it for this long
  Secrets have been brewing up a storm
  Did not expect it to transform
  Soaked up in my brain
For another day
These things I'm tryna say get drenched and swept away that's the truth
Soaked up in my brain
Don't know what to say
Something about you boy you soak up half my brain, yes you do
Ooh, ooh, something about you boy you soak up half my brain
You look at me like I hit you, ooh
Stole all your things then left you bruised, ooh
 Look what I've got myself into, ooh
My words are stuck, my body too, ooh
  I know what I did to you was wrong
  Hence why I've kept it for this long
  Secrets have been brewing up a storm
  Did not expect it to transform
  Soaked up in my brain
For another day
These things I'm tryna say get drenched and swept away that's the truth

Hence why I've kept it for this long, so long, so long
  Secrets have been brewing up a storm, a storm
Did not expect it to transform, transform
  Soaked up in my brain
For another day
These things I'm tryna say get drenched and swept away that's the truth
Soaked up in my brain
Don't know what to say

 I count down till you call me

That you do when you're lonely
And you're all about the chase
But you won't ever let me catch you
And I wish I was the same
Win again and when I do
It's gonna hurt like Hell
And you don't mean to
That's what I tell myself
But why you gotta be so heartless?
I know you think it's harmless
You're tearing me apart and

You're so high on attention
Taking miles for inches
Leave me in the darkness
Never finish what we started

Tuesday night was just another fight
Wednesday, I thought everything would change
Thursday came and it was still the same
Friday night, we went out on the town
Saturday, we should have burned it down
Sunday morning came and now you're gone

Blank walls surrounding me
Stuck in between two scenes

Left broke down chasing dreams

Planning out my revenge on you (On you)

Pulling down on the trigger

Jeg skal la deg gråte ferdig for et liv på min bekostning hvis du finner et vindu til meg
  Jeg kommer hjem igjen
Hva enn som var hjemme igjen
Jeg kanke dra til henne igjen
Det er min skyld at det er endevendt
Så hun har ting som koker nedi kjelleren som noe hjemmebrent
Og jeg har ting i skapet og i permen
Lar det ringe to ganger før jeg legger på så du må ringe opp og jeg ser navnet ditt på skjermen 
Med et bilde - av deg
Jeg håper du har plass, jeg håper du har plass
Jeg kommer helt alene og ikke med noe lass
Du kan si når jeg må skjerpe meg og sette meg på plass hvis du finner et vindu til meg
Oh, fang meg når jeg faller eller mister meg selv og siste flammen eller gnisten
Jeg skal la deg gråte ferdig for et liv på min bekostning hvis du finner et vindu til meg
  Jeg har sovet ute før
Da var jeg nærmere den ekte meg
Den langt ifra den perfekte litt defekte meg
Trodde det var Jesus når de vekte meg, men jeg er lett å lure
Hele livet har hele verden vært på meg
Så jeg ga opp og få de til å forstå meg
Jeg kan lage middag, det er det samme for meg
Hva med frossen pytt-i-panne?
Jeg håper du har plass, jeg håper du har plass
Jeg kommer helt alene og ikke med noe lass
Du kan si når jeg må skjerpe meg og sette meg på plass hvis du finner et vindu til meg
Oh, fang meg når jeg faller eller mister meg selv og siste flammen eller gnisten
Jeg skal la deg gråte ferdig for et liv på min bekostning hvis du finner et vindu til meg
 Det er ingenting som fenger lenger
Eller føles ut som en ekte følelse
Og det har nettopp begynt å øse ned
Så jeg håper du har plass
Jeg håper du har plass til meg,
Igjen og igjen og igjen og igjen
Hver gang jeg har tenkt å vende hjem til deg

go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely

It was a big big world,  but we thought we were bigger.
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker.
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure
Once I was eleven years old, my daddy told me,
go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely.
Once I was eleven years old
I always have that dream like my Daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about the glory, just always seemed to bore me,
Cause only those I really love will ever really know me 
Once I was twenty years old, my story got told,
before the morning sun, when life was lonely.
Once I was twenty years old
I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure.
Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major,
I got my boys with me at, least those in favor
and if we don´t meet before I leave, I hope to see you later.
Once I was 20 years old my story got told
I was writing about everything I saw before me 
Once I was 20 years old
Soon we´ll be 30 years old our songs have been sold
we´ve travel around the world and we´re still roaming
Soon we´ll be 30 years old
I´m still learning about life my woman brought children for me
so I can sing them all my songs and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother I´m still sorry
Soon I´ll be 60 years old my daddy got 61
remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made the man so happy when I wrote the letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month

We in here, like Rogain, Or leave it, like Cobain

Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a lambo like Lebron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go, Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo

Can't tell... Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
Cause they don't care, It's kinda sad, but I'm 
Laughing whatever happens, Assassins are stabbed in the back of my 
cabin, Labrador yapping, I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special

 Wrist icicle, ride dick bicycle
 Come true yo, get you this type of blow
 If you wanna menage I got a tricycle
 All these bitches, hoes is my mini-me
 I be smoking so they call me young Nicki chimney
 Rappers in they feelings cause they feelin' me

 Gun pop and I make my gum pop

 These friends keep talkin' way too much
 Saying I should give you up
 Can't hear them no, cause I...

 And boy, you got me walkin' side to side

 Dangerous love, you’re no good for me darling
 Yeah you turn me away, like I’m begging for a dollar
 Danger oh, how you hold me
 I get chill inside, and nothing frightens me baby, oh
 Is it love, when so easily said goodbye?
 Is it love, when we’ve given up before we try? 
 Is it love, when you stole my peace of mind?
 Is it love, when you cry, cry and cry?
 So when you walk out that door, don’t you come back no more
 My heart has had enough of the give or take, and as much as I want you to stay
 You’re a dangerous love, baby you’re no good for me darling
‘Cause if you’re gonna love me and leave me hanging here, then I’d rather you 
 Leave me lonely, even though it’s, ha-ah-ah
 Ooh-ooh, you’re a dangerous love
 Dangerous love, you’re no good for me darling
 Yeah you turn me away, like I’m begging for a dollar
 Danger oh, how you hold me
 I get chill inside, and nothing frightens me baby, oh
 So when you walk out that door, don’t you come back no more

 I've never been so caught up
 Still so into us
 I never thought I'd be here
 Should've turned to dust
 Ooh, let's be honest, baby
 This is so unusual
 Ooh, and I'm not tempted, baby
 Even if they're beautiful
 I used to be cautious
 A little too reckless
 Now all my emotions
 Are all cause of you
 I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
 I ain't even think of letting go
 I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
 I don't even see it down the road
 Cause we're collectin' moments
 Tattoos on my mind
 I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
 I ain't even think of letting go
 Not even sometimes
 La, la, la, la, la, la, la
 La, la, la, la, la, la, la
 La, la, la, la, la, la, la
 Ooh, let's be honest, baby

 I used to be easy
 For someone to steal me

 I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
 I ain't even think of letting go
 I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
 I don't even see it down the road

 Tattoos on my mind
 I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
 I ain't even think of letting go
 Not even sometimes
 I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
 Why it never worked, but it's going to now
 You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
 What it does to me when I feel you around
 Is it love? Is it lust? Is it fear?
 But it's hard to breathe when you're touching me there
 Hard to breathe when you're kissing me there
 Hard to breathe when you're not here
 I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
 I ain't even think of letting go
 I ain't ever thought of going nowhere

36,The Final Frame,Michael Kiwanuka,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/michael-kiwanuka/the-final-frame-chords-1909000,"I said I wanted you
And you from the start
I could tell you apart
But my heart fell and broke in two
You felt the pain for my foolish games 
Didn't know what I stood to lose     
I realized, that you'd be my life 
It's true
Love's been a strain, a strain in my heart
I'm numb to the feeling
It's too late, to run away
The final frame will never know
Just float away, in our parade
Of love and pain, away we go, away we go
I said I wanted to
Do all I can, to be a good man
But the scene I fell into
Took me away, but what can I say?
It's the times, I'm living through
And we can't pretend
We're reaching the end
It's true
Love's been a strain, a strain in my heart
I'm numb to the feeling
It's too late, to run away
The final frame will never know
Just float away, in our parade
Of love and pain, away we go, away we go

I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me I just melt away
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear.
But I know
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it after fighting through my fears
And finally you put me first
Baby it's you.
You're the one I love.
You're the one I need.
You're the only one I see.
Come on baby it's you.
You're the one that gives your all.
You're the one I can always call.
When I need you Baby everything stops.
Finally you put my love on top.
Ooo! Come on Baby.
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top.
You put my love on top.
Ooo! Come on Baby.
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top.
Come on Baby
I can feel the wind whipping past my face.
As we dance the night away.
Boy your lips taste like a night of champagne.
As I kiss you again, and again, and again and again.

In fact you tricked me
And I wasn’t trying to fall in love but boy you pushed me
So all that I’m asking
Is that you handle me with caution
Cause I don’t give myself often
Cause I’ve had my heart
Broken before
And I promised I would never let me hurt anymore
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
Oh baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
I’m mad at you
For being so cute
And changing my mood
What’s wrong with you
You make me sick for being so perfect
What did I do
And I wasn’t trying
To melt this heart of iron
But the way you hold me makes the old me pass away
And I would be lying
If I said I wasn’t scared to fall again
But if you promise me you’ll catch me
Cause I’ve had my heart
Broken before
And I promised I would never let me hurt anymore
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
Oh baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
Oh I hate that I
Spend my days just wasting time day dreaming til I see you again
I’m not used to this
Oh I used to be so used to boys just using me
For you to be you to me
Feels new to me
Cause I usually cheer for the bad side
Love under a bad sign
So it makes me mad I’m
Falling again
Falling again
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one
Oh baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
Oh baby I’m yours
But I tore down my walls
And opened my doors
And made room for one

With cotton and feather
  Gave you love, put my heart inside you
Oh what could I do
When you started talking in your sleep
Saying things you'd do to me
I didn't care
Now I'm finding knives under the sheets
Crumbled photographs of me
I'm in despair
Teddy bear, you are my teddy bear
You were comforting and quiet
How did love become so violent?
Oh, teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
Everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me
  I threw you out, I didn't outgrow you
I just didn't know you
  But now you're back
And it's so terrifying how you paralyze me
Now you showing up inside my home
Breathing deep into the phone
I'm so unprepared
Teddy bear, you are my teddy bear
You were comforting and quiet
How did love become so violent?
Oh, teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
Everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me
I'm fucking scared

You were comforting and quiet
How did love become so violent?
Oh, teddy bear, you were my teddy bear
Everything was so sweet until you tried to kill me

Drag me through the dirt, cut me to the bone
Leave me for dead and laugh your way back home
I'd still be smiling, like a madman in the rain
And I would love you just the same
So do your worst to me
Test my loyalty
I will pass with distinction
Of first degree
I lost my mind to you
Somewhere down the line that you drew
But I only have myself to blame
Cos I still love you just the same
Flog me with malice till the rivers run red
Make me an outlaw, put a price upon my head
And cast me to exile or a house for the insane
And I would love you just the same
So do your worst to me
Test my loyalty

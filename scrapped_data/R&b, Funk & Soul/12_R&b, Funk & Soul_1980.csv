SOMETHING I’D LIKE FOR YOU TO HEAR, AND ONLY YOUR EARS ALONE
SO MUCH SO I’D LIKE TO ,SETTLE DOWN WITH YOU, AND MAKE A HOME
YOU ARE MY FIRST BREATH, MY FIRST SMILE, AND MY MORNING CUP OF TEA
YOURS IS THE LOVE, THAT I PRAY FOR, BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP
FROM THE TIME I SAW YOUR FACE, I KNEW NO OTHER COULD ERASE
MY LOVING YOU WITH EACH BEAT OF MY HEART
UNTIL THE DAY I HEARD YOUR SPEAK, I DIDN’T KNOW THAT SOUND WAS SWEET
ME HEARING YOU WITH EACH BEAT OF MY HEART
THERE’S A TIME WHEN PLAYING ENDS, AND THE SERIOUS BEGINS
LIKE THE LOVE THAT I FELT FROM THE START, WITH EACH BEAT OF MY HEART
YOURS IS THE LOVE, THAT I PRAY FOR, BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP
FROM THE TIME I SAW YOUR FACE, I KNEW NO OTHER COULD ERASE
MY LOVING YOU WITH EACH BEAT OF MY HEART

Never around to love me
You're always gone
Cause you're hangin out
Breakin' the rules
Oh the man has come
Looking for you
You're a rebel now, Don't give a damn,
Always carrying on, With the gang
I'm trying to tell you boy, It's a mistake,
You won't realize, Til it's too late
Don't understand , Why you insist,
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies
Black cat,  Nine lives,   Short days,  Long Nights, Livin on the edge, Not afraid to die
Heart beat,  Real strong, But not for long, Better watch your step or you’re gonna die
You're so together boy, But just at a glance
You'll do anything, If given a chance
Scheming, plannin lies, To get what you need
So full of promises, That you never keep
Don't you tell yourself, That it's okay
Sick and tired of, All of your games
And you want me to stay, Better change
Makes no sense to me, Your crazy ways
Don't understand , Why you insist,
On ways of living such a dangerous life
Time after time you stay away
And I just know that you're telling me lies
Good luck with that!  I’ll post something in a couple years when I can play it!

Livin on the edge, Not afraid to die
Heart beat, Real strong, But not, For long
Better watch your step, Or you're gonna die

12,I Know Him So Well,Whitney Houston,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/whitney-houston/i-know-him-so-well-chords-582825,"    Nothing is so good it lasts eternally,
    perfect situations must go wrong.
    But this has never yet prevented me,
    from wanting far too much, for far too long.
    Looking back, I could have done it differently,
    won a few more moments, who can tell?
    But it took time to understand the man,
    now at least I know, I know him well.
Wasn't it good (wasn't it good)?
Wasn't it fine (wasn't it fine)?
Isn't it madness?  He can't be mine.
But in the end, he needs a little bit more than before,
Security (he needs his fantasy and freedom)
I know him so well!
    No one in your life is with you constantly,
    no one is completely on your side.
    And though I move my world to be with him,
    still the gap between us is too wide.
    Looking back, I could've played it differently,
    learned about the man before I fell. 
    But I was ever so much younger then,
    now at least I know, I know him well.
Wasn't it good (oh, so good)?
Wasn't it fine (so fine)?
Isn't it madness?  He can't be mine.
    Didn't I know, how it would go?
    If I knew from the start
    Why am I falling apart?
Wasn't it fine (so fine)?
Isn't it madness?  He can't be mine.
But in the end, he needs a little bit more than before,
Security (he needs his fantasy and freedom)
I know him so well!
It took some time to understand him
Ooh, I know him so well.

You're a bonafide in every respect
You are walking through streets that mean nothing to you
 You believe you're above it and I don't really blame you
 Maybe that's why you speak like a child;
 The things you're saying like ""I'm so free and so wild""
 And I believe it when you look in my eyes;
 You offer me a life that never lies
Least only the kind to make me smile
 Your clothes are clean and your mind is productive
 It shops in store where only the best buy
 You're cool and hard, and if I sound like a lecher
 It's probably true, but at least there's no lecture
 I really like it when you speak like a child
 The crazy sayings like ""I'm so free and so wild""
 You have to make a bargain with me now
 A promise that you won't change somehow
No way, no how
Spent all day thinking about you
Spent all night coming to terms with it
Time and conditions are built to tame
Nothing lasts with age, so people say
But I will always try to feel the same

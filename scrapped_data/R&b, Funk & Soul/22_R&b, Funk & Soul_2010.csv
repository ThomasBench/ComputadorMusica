I don't think that it's supposed to be hard, if it's really meant to be
 So give me a sign
 Is he always gonna be mine?
Have I given it enough of my time?
You cannot blame if it don't mean nothing
Sweet, sweet fate
I had about all I can take
Am I living in the path that I make
Is it yours I wonder
Sweet, sweet fate
Oh if it's really out of my hands
Can you forgive all of my sins?
Have mercy on  me,   me
 Why me?
If you walked a mile using my feet
You would go a little easy on me
You know where I'm coming from, yeah
 How come, when I'm lookin' at everyone
They get away with havin' their fun
I'm payin' these dues when they don't mean nothing
Sweet sweet fate
I had about all that can take
Am I my living in the path that I make
Is it yours? I wonder

Oh if it's really out of my hands

l'anima di questo mondo
emergendo le radici
e abbracciando l'Equatore
vorrei tu facessi lo stesso
con la mano sul mio cuore
quando mi guardi negli occhi
vorrei finire nel frullatore
Ma dimmi come si può stare bene
anche quando si è lontani
e non sento la tua voce
ormai da troppe settimane
dimmi come si può stare vivi
anche senza respirare
Posso soltanto deglutire singhiozzare
cantare nella testa
questo motivo che mi fa
 stare come la gatta
che guarda dalla finestra
la luna che cade in un lago dipinto di blu
e ci caschi anche tu (fischiettando)
Nel cielo la notte è romantica
venere bacia Orione
senza sapere dove senza sapere come
vorrei tu facessi lo stesso
chiamandomi col mio nome
l'amore attraversa lo spazio
di chilometri e anni luce
ma dimmi come si può stare bene
anche quando si è lontani
e non sento la tua voce
ormai da troppe settimane
dimmi come si può stare vivi
anche senza respirare
Posso soltanto deglutire singhiozzare
cantare nella testa
questo motivo che mi fa
 stare come la gatta
che guarda dalla finestra
la luna che cade in un lago dipinto di blu
e ci caschi anche tu (fischiettando)
Amore non è una scusa
ma giuro mi sono perso
non è stata una bella avventura
però mi è piaciuta lo stesso
c'era la luna in un lago che emanava il suo riflesso
e una banda suonava lontano una musica blues
ci saresti cascata anche tu

You know that my mind is willing
I just gotta get my body right
Won't you sing it now?
 Eh-eh-eh, eh
 Eh-eh-eh, eh
Right now I can't seem
To fight the feeling, demons here waiting on me
I’m hanging by my pride, my energy
Is draining slowly, please don’t cry, shorty
Ay, miss me with that ""How you been, how you doing?""
In Paris talking fluent, like they know my influence
Took a lot of talent to make thousands out of toonies
But that's exactly what I’m doing
I got Danny Caesar cooing
 I'm peeling back Backwoods, I guess I'm back to work
 Make a mill' off a classic verse
Will I make a mill’ or a classic first?
I'm trying to restore the feeling
God damn wouldn't it be nice?
You know that my mind is willing
Can't seem to get this right
I'm trying to restore the feeling
God damn wouldn't it be nice?
You know that my mind is willing
I just gotta get my body right
Go restore that feeling
Restore, feel (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Mind is willing (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
 Feeling, feel
I can't feel it
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

I'm getting off the road and getting a real job

""This is all just in your head
Now get out of your bed (This is your)
Don't read the comment threads (This is your)
Go write a song instead (This is your)

But you ain't looking at no other dudes
'Cause you love me (I'm sorry baby, so sexy)
So you think about a chance
You find yourself trying to do my dance
Maybe 'cause you love me (Uh, you do it well)
So then we tried singing it slow now
Because you weren't used to how fast we touched (Fast we touched)
Then we locked eyes and I knew I was in there
And I was gon' tear your ass up (Tear your ass up)
I know that I'm carrying on, never mind if I'm showing off
I was just frontin' (You know I want you, babe)
I'm ready to bet it all, unless you don't care at all
But you know I want ya (You should stop frontin', babe)

But still you sneak and look at me, and girl, I love it
Then you give your other girl a shove
Tell her you gonna call her ass how it was
And she's gonna love it (Whoa-oh whoa, yeah, yeah)

Every time your name was brought up
I would act all nonchalant in front of an audience
Like you was just another shorty I put the naughty on
But uh, truth be told, you threw me for a loop, this Hov
I'm too old to be frontin' what I'm feelin'
Denzelin', actin' like you ain't appealin' when you are
Stuntin' like you ain't my only girl when you are

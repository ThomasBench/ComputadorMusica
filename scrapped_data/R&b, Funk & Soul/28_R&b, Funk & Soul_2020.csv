The film is dark but it's only reconstructing light that don't shine no more
Can't help but dream of nights, I can't live no more
The feeling's died, she don't sleep in my arms no more
But I'll get right in a little bit,
I'll find my light in a little bit
Just passed out on my bedroom floor
I'll get back up
I lost my mind when I needed it,
Yeah it's so sad
What we had was never enough for us
Yeah, self-division in the dark
Versions of another version fell apart
High speed, I speed
Yelling at the silver linings from the dark
And it's just starting to sink in
I've ran through the morning when the light showed me nothing
So close but, you say we're better off
I don't think you understand
I was splitting the loom
And my suppression of you, I left some time ago
So how you gon' stop me now?
Woah, these waves just keep raining down
But I'll get right in a little bit,
I'll find my light in a little bit
Just passed out on my bedroom floor
I'll get back up
I lost my mind when I needed it,
Yeah it's so sad
What we had was never enough for us
How fast the light died out
We lost track of ourselves, riding the wave (Woah)
At last, the time will run out
Waiting for us to lose it now (You gave up, yeah)
Don't you let me down

Tenner på en blomst, den kommer ifra Afghanistan
Hun får meg med på alt, har snakketøyet til Skavlan
Og når vi hadde sex - jeg følte meg som en Gud
Hun er sikkert i en AirBnB med en dude
Med et kamera som sverger at kvinnekroppen er kunst
Og jeg er hjemme og runker og tar dop
Lagde jeg Sandstorm og heter Darude
Jeg sto inne på en KFC i Paris
Da du ringte og sa: ""Nå kommer de, okay, peace""
Og la på like etter du sa:

Og jeg har skuffen full av flotte klær jeg ikke kler

Og de fortjener å bli hørt de òg

Jeg er en flyvefisk i et evighetsbasseng
Hjertet på - Hjertet på skjorta og skjorta på vreng
Kjenner noen jenter fra nedi byen som gjør gutter til menn
Speak of the devil, han kommer som en snegle
Ting er mye nærmere enn de ser ut som i speilet
Jeg er hypp på å ri en hoppe opp i fjellet og bare steile
Ikke bare stå der, ta bilde av meg nå din dust
Jeg er hjemme med en stor, stygg joint
Ser på video av en hund som er venn med en pus
Og hun er i Milano og New York og tar det helt fuckings kult
Og drikker GT med pepper og agurk
Mamma syntes at jeg ser sliten ut
Det er bare synd at du må se meg sånn
Men med meg går det bra
For de gode går først men legender lever evig

When you leave me on my own
You leave me on my own
You leave me with your ghost

Reminiscing 'bout the apricots and blunts on Peckham Rye
Won't call her friends 'cause she's ashamed of being locked into bed
Can't feel her legs and feeling like a liar at best

You're not alone like you think you are
We all have scars, I know it's hard

You're not alone, you're not alone

Started sweating bullets when her dad asked, ""How d'you really feel?""
She said, ""I've been feeling like something inside me wants to scream""
Won't call my friends, I'm persuaded that they'll leave in the end
Can't feel my legs, I'm feeling like a liar at best

We all havе scars, I know it's hard
You're not alone, you're not alone
(spoken) I've often felt like I was born under a bad sign
Wearing suffering like a silk garment or a spot of blue ink
Looking for light and finding a hole where there shouldn't be one
I cannot communicate the depth of the feeling
Truth is I'm still learning to be open about this
But know that I know and you're not alone
You know that I know and you're not alone
You're not alone like you think you are
You're not alone like you think you are
We all have scars, I know it's hard
You're not alone, you're not alone

  Se litighiamo in mezzo ad altre persone
  Non ha senso chiedere agli amici  chi ha la ragione
Se per te non vale un cazzo chi siamo
Oggi per me noi valiamo più di un Ocean Drive
Se ti chiedo come stai
La verità brucia in faccia come la cicatrice di Inuyasha
Non so più come stiamo ancora in piedi

Dire addio non vuol dirе che è la fine
Metterò il peggio di me
Dentro a una crisalide
Per non farti più male
Se lo farai anche te
 Passare tutti i giorni insieme fa paura
 Dirti che voglio stare solo   è difficile
La gente ti parla, poi ti ama, vuole tutto, poi ti spara
Preferisco te a chi mi mente
Scopare in giro non mi lascia niente

Si possa andare avanti senza perdono?

Motivo per non fare danni, danni, danni

Henger meg på stimen

Meg til noe
Jeg har skrapa på bunn
Jeg har lyst til å vokse ut håret, kanskje
Lage en baby
Lyst til å bade i havet
Og kysse en kompis på munn

Jeg tror jeg begynner å skjønne hvordan
Hodet mitt bare spiller for galleriet
 Har det på tunga hva det minner meg om

 Gi meg styrke
Trenger nye ben å stå på, lever såvidt
Så jeg beveger med så små prøvende
Skritt
Jeg tror jeg tørr å ta fart
Jeg tror jeg tørr å ta litt plass igjen
Kjenner meg så blå, men det gir slipp
Har det på tunga hva det minner meg om
Jeg skal ta strupetak på alt som kvalt meg
Drikke til det ser ut som om Picasso har
 Inni meg bor det et monster
 Som i blandt bare vil lukte på blomster
Og smile til hunder og klappe på katter
Stoppe noen og si at ""fy faen, du er
 Jeg tror jeg ser et glimt der fremme i
 Vent på meg i enden - vær så snill
 Det har gått et lite sekund siden jeg gleda
Meg til noe
Jeg har skrapa på bunn
Jeg har lyst til å vokse ut håret, kanskje
Lage en baby
Lyst til å bade i havet
Og kysse en kompis på munn
Jeg tror jeg kler å være i live
Jeg tror jeg begynner å skjønne hvordan
Hodet mitt bare spiller for galleriet
 Har det på tunga hva det minner meg om
Jeg tror jeg kler å være glad
 Gi meg styrke
Trenger nye ben å stå på, lever såvidt
Så jeg beveger med så små prøvende
Skritt
Jeg tror jeg tørr å ta fart
Jeg tror jeg tørr å ta litt plass igjen
Kjenner meg så blå, men det gir slipp
Har det på tunga hva det minner meg om

Maybe I've been thinking too much
Maybe I don't want it enough
It's way too much pressure
I cope badly when I'm madly, deeply alone
Knee deep in stone
Decent sleep and melatonin
Showing up when I'm not slowing
Down and out is my default
I thrive on, drive on high results
Low gain, Rogaine, balding
No shame, treadmill, Usain
Nobody asks me if I'm okay
And even if they did I would lie and just say
""I'm fine, good vibes, goodbye, good day sir""
The hater inside is the Vader of shade
I've never been a go-getter
Who knew being better
Was so much pressure?
I keep thinking I'm in a rush
Maybe I've been thinking too much
Maybe I don't want it enough
I need to get up
Relieve some pressure
I buy shit, like it for two days, then hide it
And I get excited then drop off a cliff
Eyes on the prize
And the prize is a life realising that time's not a right, it's a gift
Fuck up, stuck up, speak up or shut up
Champagne socialist, I'm a hypocrite
Melt like butter when other's suffer
Tell myself it's all relative
I've never been a go-getter
Who knew being better
Was so much pressure?
I keep thinking I'm in a rush
Maybe I've been thinking too much
Maybe I don't want it enough
I need to get up
Relieve some pressure
I'm too hard on myself but not in the right way
It won't help if I stay in my bed all day
So I should seek real help so I can help myself
And work on that part before someone else
I should be a vegan, stop eating living things
Recycle properly and stop just binning things
Be nice to strangers, dance with my wife
And celebrate, instead of hate, appreciate life
I've never been a go-getter
Who knew being better
Was so much pressure?
I keep thinking I'm in a rush
Maybe I've been thinking too much
Maybe I don't want it enough
I need to get up

Mentre accendon le luci del mondo
Ricompongo parti di me

They say it's a phase, it'll change if we vote
I'm a spaceman
And the numbers are high but we keep goin' down
I'm a spaceman
And I'm talking to you
I'm on my own, I'm a spacеman

I'm tryna get home, I'm a spaceman
Mask off minute I get home
Almost like a spaceman
Keep on thinking that we're close
I'm in outer space, man
And I'm talking to you
I'm on my own, I'm a spacеman

Only way that I can

Turn the TV off, make the bed
Oh my God, it's five, once again
All my friends are home, so am I
So I drink alone, justified
Now I'm dancing in the kitchen, breaking all the dishes
Breaking all the rules that I set myself
""Oh, you never know when to stop""
Like everyday's Friday night,
And, oh, I think I just hit my stride
Till I wake up and hate my life
Oh well, now I'm high as thе ceiling, oh
Should I sеnd that text? Maybe not
But I miss that sex, quite a lot
Now I'm dancing in the kitchen, breaking all the dishes
Breaking all the rules that I set myself
""Oh, you never know when to stop""
Like everyday's Friday night,
And, oh, I think I just hit my stride
Till I wake up and hate my life
Oh well, now I'm high as thе ceiling, oh
Nothing good happens at 4:00 in the morning
But it's another day, guess I'm keeping it going
Did some crazy things, but that was yesterday
""Oh, you never know when to stop""
Like everyday's Friday night,
And, oh, I think I just hit my stride
Till I wake up and hate my life
Oh well, now I'm high as thе ceiling, oh

I wanna be the only thing you can ever thought
Every day, every night, when you try to breathe
I wanna be selfish, selfish
Want all of you for me
All of you for all of me
All of you for all of me
All of you for all of me
All of you, all of me
All of you for all of me
All of you for all of me
All of you for all of me
All of you, all of me
I wanna be selfish, selfish
For you and not for me (Not)
I wanna be loveless (Oh), selfless (Oh, woah)
Want all of you for me
I wanna be the only thing you can ever thought
Every day, every night, when you try to breathe
I wanna be selfish (Hey, hey), selfish (Yeah)
Want all of you for me
These are the days we dream about
You wake me up inside
Turn my darkness nights into something real
They say, ""Take your time""
What's the rush? But I know the way I feel
And all those flashing lights
Be keep tryna tell me if it's love and take it slow-oh-oh-oh
But they can't change my mind
Yet, sometimes, we play with fire even though we know-oh-oh-oh, yeah, I know
Loving you is dangerous
But that's all I wanna do, it's dangerous
Don't care what you put me through
My heart is hiding, could break anytime
Yes, why? Why? Why?
Can't I stop loving you?
Open up the door, I'm coming back for more
Almost like we, uh, yeah-yeah, yeah
Scares me half to death, the way you take my breath
But we both know, the deal, oh, no
And all those flashing lights
Be keep tryna tell me if it's love and take it slow-oh-oh-oh (Take it slow)
But they can't change my mind
Yet, sometimes, we play with fire even though we know-oh-oh-oh, yeah, I know
Loving you is dangerous
But that's all I wanna do, it's dangerous
Don't care what you put me through
My heart is hiding, could break anytime
Yes, why? Why? Why?
Can't I stop loving you?
It's dangerous
That's all I wanna do, it's dangerous, yeah
Don't care what you put me through
My heart is hiding, but I try to fight it
Now, why? Why? Why?
Can't I stop loving you?
It's dangerous
It's dangerous
You wake me up inside
Turn my darkness nights into something real
Oh, loving you is dangerous
That's all I wanna do, it's dangerous (Hey)
Don't care what you put me through
My heart is hiding, could break anytime
Yes, why? Why? Why?
Can't I stop loving you?
It's dangerous (Oh, yeah)
That's all that I wanna do, it's dangerous (Yeah, hey)
Don't care what you put me through
My heart is hiding, but I try to fight it
Now, why? Why? Why?
Can't I stop loving you?
Can't I stop loving you? It's
Can't I stop loving you? It's dangerous

Was about to write you this letter
But it was just curses in cursive
You probably deserve it
But that's so impersonal, should tell you in person
I hope it don't hurt you, but then, I've been hurt too by you
The truth is, all you do is
Leave me emotional bruises
  You're callin' me up to link up and figure shit out
  No doubt, time's out, we never figure shit out
  I can't do this no more, you call me your life support
'Cause this is the fifth time I've taken you back
It's the fourth time, that we've relapsed
It's the third-second chance that I've given you
For the first time, let this be the last time
Fifth time I've taken you back
It's the fourth time, that I've collapsed into your arms
For the first time, let this be the last
This vicious cycle, it's driving me psycho
I'm anxious need someone to come check my vitals (Come check my vitals)
One minute I'm leaving, the next I forgive you
  You're callin' me up to link up and figure shit out
  No doubt, time's out, we never figure shit out
  I can't do this no more, cutting off the life support
'Cause this is the fifth time I've taken you back
It's the fourth time, that we've relapsed
It's the third-second chance that I've given you
For the first time, let this be the last time
Fifth time I've taken you back
It's the fourth time, that I've collapsed into your arms
For the first time, let this be the last

Let this be last
No, it's gotta be

46,Párteme La Cara,C. Tangana,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/3585497,"  Mejor dame otra calada
  O párteme la cara
O miénteme y dime que me quieres
Que todo está bien, que no ha cambiado nada
Duermo con el cadenón bien puesto
Porque pienso en las noches que soñé su peso
Y porque el resto de cosas que importan se fueron contigo
Me he cansa'o del primer puesto
Ya no quiero ser mejor que еl resto
Porque todas las cosas que importan sе fueron contigo
  Mejor no me digas nada
  Ya no quiero más palabras
Acuérdate bien de que me tienes
Cuando quieras ven, acá no pasó nada
  Mejor dame otra calada
  O párteme la cara
O miénteme y dime que me quieres
Que todo está bien, que no ha cambiado nada
Brindo por las noches y lloro en la mañanas
Y escribo cosas buenas de algunas chicas malas
 Sobre todo cuando ya se han marchado
Guccis en el closet, cien mil en una noche
La vida que querías; los Lambos y los Porsches
Y todo para que al final te hayas marcha'o
  Mejor no me digas nada
  Ya no quiero más palabras
Acuérdate bien de que me tienes
Cuando quieras ven, acá no pasó nada

I was only tryna get my morning caffeine
When did you assume that I liked the eyes on me?
And I disappeared from the earth and now I really see
See people have it worse than me and I shouldn't be complaining
But the recognition of my face has really got me hating
Climbing up the ladder, but she shoot me 'cause I'm rising
And you don't see the high with you and the human that's been dying
But I'll show you the good in the bad (The good in the bad)
The bеst thing that we ever had (Wе ever had)
And the saddest thing that makes me really mad
And it makes me, makes me, makes me
Blame it on society (Blame it on society)
Stay the hell away from me (Stay the hell away from me)
Society (Blame it on society)
Stop telling me who I'm supposed to be (Who I'm supposed to be)
I'm only tryna be me, baby, baby
I'm only tryna be me, baby, baby
I'm only tryna be me, baby, baby
See the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree
And what was meant to be was always meant to be
And you need to be on the sidelines, not the centre of the show
And home is where the heart was, so you really ought to know
And everything I did could not happen without you
Sometimes you gotta take a second look at the view
The places we used to go, and the people we used to meet
Oh, will always be such beautiful memories to me
But I'll show you the good in the bad (The good in the bad)
The bеst thing that we ever had (Wе ever had)

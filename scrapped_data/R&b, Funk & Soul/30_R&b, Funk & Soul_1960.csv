Just find that dappled dream of yours
And come on back and see me when you can

49,Baby Baby Baby,Aretha Franklin,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/aretha-franklin/baby-baby-baby-chords-2221259,"Baby, baby, baby, this is just to say
How much I'm gonna' miss you, but believe while I'm away
That I didn't mean to hurt you, don't you know that I'd rather hurt myself?
(I'd hurt myself, I'd hurt myself)
     Baby, baby, baby, baby, think of me sometimes
Because if loving you was so wrong, then I'm guilty of this crime
I'm bewildered, I'm lonely, and I'm loveless, without you to hold my hand
(Reach out for me, boy)  If you'd just understand
Those that we love, we foolishly make cry
Then sometimes feel it's best to say goodbye, goodbye
But what's inside can't be denied
The power, The power of love
Is my only guide, Baby (Oh) [x2]
Baby, baby, baby, this is just to say
How much I'm gonna' miss you, but believe while I'm away
That I didn't mean to hurt you, don't you know that I'd rather hurt myself?
(I'd hurt myself,) Baby, I need you, I need you, I need you
If I did you wrong, I need you, I need you, I need you

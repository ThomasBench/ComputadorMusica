1,Aint It Funny (ver 2),Jennifer Lopez,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jennifer-lopez/aint-it-funny-chords-72381,"It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives we can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind
I'd live a thousand lives each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less than perfect circumstance
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart
Sometimes I think that a true love can never be
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about
A deeper love I've found in you and I no longer doubt
You've touched my heart and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid
I locked away my heart but you just set it free
Emotions I felt held me back from what my life should be
I pushed you far away and yet you stayed with me
I guess this means that you and me were meant to be

I have torn everyone who reached out for me.
But I swear by this song and by all that I have done wrong
I will make it all up to thee.

We danced and sang somewhere in between heaven and hell
Gabrielle, that was her name
Everyone was smiling, even through their tears, under a spell
But in Gabby's eyes, nothing
I asked do you not like the music?
She said it's alright
But she dances to her own sad tune, she said
Take me away from here
Take me somewhere where love is like breathing
I don't care where we go as long as I'm there with you, baby
Long as I'm there with you
I could tell, she's been through pain I could only dream
Nightmares to live where you live
Tears well in her eyes, but she wouldn't let them fall
I'd give the world to know where her smile is
I asked will you dance with me now
Let me try to figure out
The fastest round out of town and she says
Take me away from here
Take me somewhere, where love is like breathing
I don't care where we go, long as I'm there with you baby

And I'd have wanted to stay
But I got nothing to say
You were so beautiful
Before today
But then I heard what you say
Man that was ugly

Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there, I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Just take it
Take the box

And nothing felt like how it should be
I feel like writing you a letter
But that's not me
You made me feel so fucking angry
Don't wanna be reminded of you
But when I left my shit in your kitchen
I said goodbye to your bedroom
It smelled of you
Mr. False Pretence, you don't make sense
I just don't know you
But you made me cry, where's my kiss goodbye?
I think I love you

 In the sanctuary, she has found, birds sur-round, her sweet sound.

There must have been, but I don't care,
I feel the way your soul does there.
 Darling, they empathise, looking through your bloodshot eyes.
 And I know you; you're so frustrated,
  But we all become what we once hated.
Besides, nobody, can be that wise.
 I can't help you,  if you won't help yourself.
 I can't help you,  if you won't help yourself.
 You can only get, so much from someone else.
 I can't help you,  if you won't help yourself.
 You've got a degree, a-in philosophy,
 So you think you're cleverer than me.
But I'm not just some drama queen,
'Cos it's where you're at; not where you've been.
So what do you expect from me, to hold your head above the sea?
And carry you even though you're bigger,
'Cos don't you know you crush my tiny figure?
And anyway, we're still so young, and this isn't yesterday.
 I can't help you,  if you won't help yourself.
 I can't help you,  if you won't help yourself.
 You can only get, so much from someone else.

 And I'm just a child, and you're full grown,

Baby I won't shed a tear for you (I won't shed a tear for you)
I won't lose a wink of sleep (a wink of sleep)

0,You Are Not Alone (ver 3),Michael Jackson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/michael-jackson/you-are-not-alone-chords-953756,"Another day has gone, I'm still all alone,
How could this be? You're not here with me.
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why,
Did you have to go, and leave my world so cold?
Everyday I sit and ask myself : How did love slip away?
Something whispers in my ear and says that...
You are not alone, for I am here with you.
Though you're far away, I am here to stay.
But you are not alone, for I am here with you,
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart,
But you are not alone.
'Lone...  'lone - why?
'Lone...
Just the other night I thought I heard you cry,
Asking me to come, and hold you in my arms.
I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear,
But first I need your hand, then forever can begin.
Everyday I sit and ask myself : How did love slip away?
Something whispers in my ear and says that...
You are not alone, for I am here with you.
Though you're far away, I am here to stay.
But you are not alone, for I am here with you,
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart,
But you are not alone.
Oh Whisper three  words and I'll come runnin'
And I, and girl you know that I'll be there, I'll be there
You are not alone, for I am here with you.
Though you're far away, I am here to stay.
But you are not alone, for I am here with you,
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart,
But you are not alone. (You are not alone - background vocals in parentheses)
I am here with you (I am here with you)
Though you're far away (Though we're far away, you and me)
I am here to stay
You are not alone (You are always in my heart----- )
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone...
You are not alone
You are not alone
Say it again
You are not alone
You are not alone
Not alone, not alone
If you just reach out for me girl
In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone
You and me, not alone
Oh, together, together
Gotta stop being alone
Gotta stop being alone

Like a hawk in a sky
That flies, and
you were my prey (my prey)

And you know that one of these days (days)
Probably talk from the phone
But see I don't know if that's good
This secret from you
Probably shouldn't tell you but if I
If I let you know
You can't tell nobody
I'm talkin bout nobody
Are you responsible?
Boy I gotta watch my body
I'm not just anybody
Is it my go, Is it your go
Sometimes I’m goody goody
Right now I’m naughty naughty
Say yes or say no
Cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody
Boy,
Won't you pick me up at the park right now
Up the block while everyone
Sleep, Sleep, Sleep
Wit my trench, my Locs, My hat
Just so I’m low key
Don't sleep, you know that we’ll be weak
Oh Boy,
with my heart, my soul
If I let this go......
If I let you know
You can't tell nobody
I'm talkin bout nobody
Are you responsible?
Boy I gotta watch my body

2,Black Or White,Michael Jackson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/michael-jackson/black-or-white-chords-71848,"  I took my baby on a Saturday bang,
Now I believe in miracles,
and a miracle has happened tonight.
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby,
it don't matter if you're black or white.
 They print my message in the Saturday Sun,
And I told about equality,
and it's true, either you're wrong or you're right.
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby,
it don't matter if you're black or white.
I`m tired of this devil, I`m tired of this stuff,
I`m tired of this business, so when the going gets rough.
I ain't scared of your brother, I ain't scared of no sheets,
I ain't scared of nobody, girl when the goin' gets mean.
Protection for gangs, clubs, and nations,
causing grief in human relations.
It's a turf war on a global scale,
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale.
See, it's not about races, just places, faces.
Where your blood comes from is where your space is.
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color.
Don't tell me you agree with me,
when I saw you kicking dirt in my eye.
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby,
it don't matter if you're black or white.
I said, if you're thinkin' about my baby,
it don't matter if you're black or white.
I said, if you're thinkin' of being my brother,
it don't matter if you're black or white.

You come to me, come to me wild and wired

You're simply the best,
better than all the rest
Better than anyone,

instead of slamming down the phone babe, for the hundredth time.
Got your number on my wall, but I ain't gonna make that call.
When divided we stand babe, united we fall.
Got the time, got a chance, gonna make it,
got my hands on your heart gonna take it.
All I know I can't fight this way.
You could have a change of heart, if you would only change your mind,
'cos I'm crazy 'bout you baby, time after time.
Without you, one night alone,
Is like a year without you baby, do you have heart of stone?
Without you, can't stop the hurt inside, when love and hate collide.
I don't wanna fight no more, I don't know what we're fighting for.
When we treat each other baby, like an act of war.
I could tell a million lies, but it would come as no surprise.
When the truth is like a stranger, hits you right between the eyes.
There's a time, and a place, and a reason,
And I know I gotta love to believe in.
All I know, got to win this time.
Without you, one night alone,
Is like a year without you baby, do you have heart of stone.
Without you, can't stop the hurt inside, when love and hate collide.
You could have a change of heart, if you would only change your mind

And I know that it is love
And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll find there's no hurt or sorrow
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place
Heal the world, make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying, if you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living
Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
Make a better world
Heal the world, make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying, if you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
And the dream we were conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this world, crucify it's soul
Though it's plain to see this world is Heavenly
Be God's glow
We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares
We could really get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place
Heal the world, make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying, if you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world, make it a better place

But like the weather, Nothing can ever...and be in time, Stay gold
But can it be, When we can see, So vividly, A memory
And yes you say, So must the day, To fade away, And leave a ray of sun, So  gold
Life    is but a twinkling of an eye
 Yet filled with sorrow and compassion
Though not imagined, All things that happen
Will age too old, Though gold   Oh   Oh    Though gold

I wanna kiss your smile and feel the pain
I know what's beautiful  looking at you
In a world of lies you are the truth
Every time you touch me  I become a hero
I'll make you safe  no matter where you are
Everything you ask for nothing is above me
I'm shining like a candle in the dark
When you tell me that you love me
I wanna make you see just what I was
Show you the loneliness and what it does
You walked into my life to stop my tears
Everything's easy now   I have you here 
Every time you touch me  I become a hero
I'll make you safe  no matter where you are
Everything you ask for nothing is above me
I'm shining like a candle in the dark
When you tell me that you love me
In a world without you 
I would always hunger  
All I need is your love
Every time you touch me  I become a hero
I'll make you safe  no matter where you are
Everything you ask for nothing is above me
I'm shining like a candle in the dark
When you tell me that you love me
you love me
When you tell me that you love me

I've smiled and looked away  
Saddened by my visible life
Sorrow cut me like a knife
Nobody knows you without any doubt
Nobody wants toknow you, 
when you're down and out 
So sing a hymn for my soul
Stand by me as I grow old
I'm just trying to climb up nine hills in seven short days
Sing a hymn for my soul 
I saw myself today 
Didn't like what I had to say
So right, I could only be wrong
Trouble is when I'm alone
No doubt, no self-control, not a reason to cry
I feel like empty rain, through an empty sky 
So sing a hymn for my soul
Stand by me as I grow old
I'm just trying to climb up nine hills in seven short days
Sing a hymn for my soul
I saw myself today 
I looked good, yes I had to say
Polished TV won't shine no more
Flyin' dragons surround my door
Even when I go crazy
To my own self I'll be true
Ain't nobody's business what I do 
So sing a hymn for my soul
Stand by me as I grow old
I'm just trying to climb up nine hills in seven short days

As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
You know what I say is true

Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky  (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that it's the day that I'm no more

Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
That last through forever Another day
As today I know I'm living for tomorrow
Couldn't make me be the past but that I mustn't fear
Now I know deep in my mind
The love of me I left behind
And I'll be loving you always
Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphins fly and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four
Until the day that it's the day that I'm no more

Did you know that life has given love a guarantee

Past the school that has no       changed
In all this      time
      She thinks of when the boy was          young
All the battles she had     won
     Just to give him      life
           For all his     life
      But now we meet to bring him          flowers
And only God knows      why 
    For what's the use in pressing         palms
When children fade in mother's       arms
     It's a cruel world, 
We've so      much to loose
       And what we      have to learn     we rarely choose 
     So if it's     God who took her        son
He       cannot be the     one          living in her      mind

     But I was terri -     fied
     You brushed my eyes with angels             wings,     full of     love
The kind that     makes devils cry, So
      these days     My          life has changed
      And I'll be     fine (and I´ll be fine)
      But she just sits and counts the          hours
Searching for          her crime    
    So what's the use of pressing         palms
If you won't keep such love from       harm
      It's a cruel world 
You've so      much to prove
    And heaven         helps the ones        who wait for you 
     Well I've no     daughters, I've no sons 
Guess         I'm the only     one
    Living in my      life

Would find me eventually (would find me)
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all -------------
that you turned out to

But when she leaves I'm not so sure.
It's always the same she's playing her game,
And when she goes I'll be to blame.
Why won't she say she needs me?
   I know she's not as strong as she seems.
  Why don't I see her cry for help?
  Why don't I feel her cry for help?
  Why don't I hear her cry for help?
 I wandered around the streets of this town,
Trying to find sense in it all.
The rain on my face it covers the trace,
Of all the tears I've had to waste.
Why must we hide emotions?
   Why must we never breakdown and cry?
  All that I need is to cry for help.
  Somebody please hear me cry for help.
  All I can do is cry for help.
   No need to feel ashamed.
Release the pain and cry for help.
Cry for help is all I need.

0,To Know You Is To Love You (ver 2),B.B. King,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/b-b-king/to-know-you-is-to-love-you-chords-3323360,"To know you is to love you
But to know me is not that way, you see
'Cause you made me so happy
That my love for you grows endlessly
When I'm down and feeling sad
You always comfort me
When I'm down and feeling sad
You always comfort me
Baby, to know you is to love you
You smile when I see your face
'Cause there ain't no one on this earth
Baby, could ever, ever take your place
When I'm down and feeling sad
You always comfort me
When I'm down and feeling sad
You always comfort me
Oh to know you is to love you
Is to see you being free as the wind
'Cause the power of your loving
Is too strong to hold within
To know you is to love you
To see you blowing free in the breeze
The power of your loving
I never found a woman like you
That could be my lover and my best friend
I know you and I think I love you
I know you and I think I love you
I know you and can't you feel our love
Just growing, growing, growing
Growing, growing, growing
Hey, I know you and I think I love you
I know you and I think I love you
I know you and can't you feel our love
Just growing, growing, growing
Growing, growing, doggone it, baby
I know you and I think I love you
I know you and I think I love you
I know you and can't you feel our love
Just growing, growing, growing
Growing, growing, hey doggone it, baby
I know you and I think I love you
I know you and I think I love you
And I think you love me, too
Mm baby, I know you

When you lived inside of me, there was nothing I could conceive, that you wouldn't do for me
Trouble seemed so far away, you changed that right away, baby
 You abandoned me, love don't live here any-more,         
 just a vacancy, love don't live here any-more
Love don't live here anymore, just emptiness and memories of what we had before
You went away, found another place to stay another home
 You abandoned me, love don't live here any-more,         
 just a vacancy, love don't live here any-more

Just inside my door
 But my Christmas tree doesn't look the same

There's just one lonely present
Beneath my Christmas tree
'Cause the best little present a guy could have
Has gone away from me
Oh, my Christmas tree isn't very big
In fact, it's kind of small
Oh, it's funny when she'd pick them out
They'd always seem so tall
The light doesn't seem so bright this year
It's hard for me to see
The smile that made my Christmas right
Has gone away from me
I have been so lonely
Since you left me all alone
All Iii want for Christmas
Is my baby, my baby back home
Oh my Christmas tree is so sad and bare
My room so big and cold
Oh, they wish me Happy New Year
But the new year's already old
There's no, no little angel
 On top where she used to be
'Cause the angel that made my Christmas right
Has gone away from me
'Cause the angel that made my Christmas right
Has gone away from me
'Cause the angel that made my Christmas right

been waiting here, it seemed a million years to me.
But hush now, I know you're all cried out,
it's all right inside, I've had no doubt.
About your love for me,  I can see behind the tears,
I'm certain of the way we feel, and given time the hurt will heal.
I need you, I think I always will,
from time to time you play around, but I love you still.
You tried them all, at everybody's beck and call,
maybe you resist them all when I tell you how I missed you.
Fallen angel, I'll forgive you anything,
you can't help the things you do,
now something's gotten hold of you,
Fallen angel, got a demon in your soul,
and later when the fever's gone,
I'll be here where you belo....ng.
You’re home again, so won't you close the door,
stay here with me and we'll forget what's gone before.
So hold me tight, our love is gonna make it right,
put shadows way beyond recall, the ghost has almost gone.
Fallen angel, I'll forgive you anything,
you can't help the things you do,
now something's gotten hold of you,
Fallen angel, got a demon in your soul,
and later when the fever's gone,
I'll be here where you belong.

   Surrounded by,       four walls that ain't so pretty,
   His parents give,      him love and af - fection,
   To keep him strong,     moving in the right di - rection,
Living just e - nough,  just e - nough,
For the city-------------!  Yah!
   His father works,      some days for fourteen hours,
   And you can bet,         he barely makes a dollar,
   His mother goes,         to scrub the floors for many,
   And you'd best believe,       she hardly gets a penny,

Woo!   His sister's black,     but she is sho' nuff pretty,
   Her skirt is short,        but, Lord, her legs are sturdy,
   To walk to school,        she's got to get up early,
   Her clothes are old,        but never are they dirty,
Living just e - nough,  just e - nough,
For the city-------------!          Hummm!
   Her brother's smart,      he's got more sense than many,
   His patience's long,       but soon he won't have any,
   To find a job,        is like a haystack needle,
   'Cause where he lives,      they don't use coloured people,
Living just e - nough, just e - nough,

   He spends his life,  walking the streets of New York City,
   He's almost dead,      from breathing in air pol - lution,
   He tried to vote,      but to him there's no so - lution,
Living just e - nough,  just e - nough,

   And that it motivates you to make a better to - morrow,
   This place is cruel,      no where could be much colder,
   If we don't change,      the world will soon be over,

To the fountain of loveliness
I will never, ever, ever leave you
Leave you alone to wonder
As we go on, our love, it will grow (It will grow)
Much stronger and stronger
Up the ladder to the roof
Where we can see heaven much better
Up the ladder to the roof
Where we can be closer to heaven

Every time we wind up spending the night.....together
Do you ever feel it?
I want to share my life with you forever
Every time we wind up spending the night......together
Do you ever feel it?
When I stay away from you I never get to sleep
I try to hug my pillow and pretend that you're with me
But I can't feel a thing
When we are together it's right there for me to see
I can't keep looking at loneliness and try to call it freedom
Do you ever feel it?
I want to spend the night with you, girl, forever
Every time we wind up spending the night......together

feel it's their appointed duty
They keep trying to tell me
all you want to do is use me

to all that use me stuff
I-I-I Is I want to spread the news
that if it feels this good getting used
Oh you just keep on using me
until you use me up
Until you use me up
My brother
sit me right down and he talked to me
He told me
that I ought not to let you just walk on me
And I'm sure he meant well
yeah but when our talk was through
I said brother if you only knew
you'd wish that you were in my shoes
You just keep on using me
until you use me up
Until you use me up
Oh sometimes
yeah it's true you really do abuse me
You get me in a crowd of high class people
and then you act real rude to me
But oh baby       baby baby baby
when you love me I can't get enough
You know I can't get enough
You know I can't get enough
Oh you just keep on using me
until you use me up
Until you use me up
Oh you just keep on using me
until you use me up
Until you use me up
Talking about you using me but it all depends on what you do
It ain't too bad the way you're using me 'Cause I sure am using you
to do the things you do...

Make me unselfish without being blind
Though I may suffer I'll envy it not
And endure what comes
Tell him...
Tell him I need him (yeah)
Tell him I love him (tell him)
And it'll be alright
Tell him tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
It'll be alright
Now I may have faith to make mountains fall
But if I lack love then I am nothin' at all
I can give away everything I possess
But left without love then I have no happiness
I know I'm imperfect (I know I'm imperfect)
And not without sin (and not without sin)
But now that I'm older all childish things end
Tell him I need him (yeah)
Tell him I love him (tell him)
And it'll be alright
Tell him tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
It'll be alright
I'll never be jealous
And I won't be too proud
Cause love is not boastful
Oooh and love is not loud
Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
Everything's gonna be alright
Now I may have wisdom and knowledge on Earth
But if I speak wrong then what is it worth?
See what we now know is nothing compared
To the love that was shown when our lives were spared
Tell him I need him (yeah)
Tell him I love him (tell him)
And it'll be alright
Tell him tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
It'll be alright

It's been three weeks since you've been looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins
You act like you ain't hear him then gave him a little trim
To begin, how you think you really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down then you called him again
Plus when you give it up so easy you ain't even fooling him
If you did it then, then you probably f*** again
Talking out your neck sayin' you're a Christian
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hardrock when you really are a gem
Babygirl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas f***ed up and you still defending them
Now Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn.
It's silly when girls sell their soul because it's in
Look at where you be in hair weaves like Europeans, fake nails done by Koreans
Come again,
Win win come again,
Brethren come again,
my friend come again,
Guys you know you better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing
   The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend popping yang like you got yen
Let's not pretend, they wanna pack pistol by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face, men claiming that they did a bid men
   Need to take care of their three and four kids men
They facing a court case when the child's support late
Money taking, heart breaking now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky silent men the punk domestic violence men
The quick to shoot the semen stop acting like boys and be men
How you gon' win when you ain't right within
How you gon' win when you ain't right within
How you gon' win when you ain't right within
Come again,
Win win come again,
Brethren come again,
my friend come again,
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Wa-watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Girls you know you better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing
Guys you know you better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing
Girls you know you better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

Your smile got me boasting, my pulse roller coastering
  Anyway the four winds that blow
   They’re gonna send me sailing home to you
  Or I’ll fly with the force of a rainbow
   The dream of gold will be waiting in your eyes
You know I’d do most anything you want

I can see that it gets to you

But in you    I do

The pain that she goes through contained in the hope for you
   Your whole world has changed
The years spent before seem more cloudy than blue
   In many ways your baby’s controlling
   When you haven’t laid down for days
   For the poor no time to be thinking
   They’re too busy finding ways
And I, You know I’d do most anything you want

Och min kärlek utan villkor
Jag gör vad jag kan
Så stor och stark på dagen
Men så liten mitt i natten
När ingen ser, när ingen vet
Kommer gråten mitt i skratten

Ett är solen
Ett är Polstjärnan bakom molnen

Men det är natten som gör dagen ljus
Och mitt ljus är du
På denna jord-e-rund
Finns här ingen ann'
Som kan ge mig sån förtvivlan
Och som är lika sann
Du blir rädd för dina skuggor
Alla hot som aldrig når dig
Jag skall sjunga dig ett löfte
Jag vet att du förstår mej
Fem fingrar ska skydda dig
Ett är månen
Ett är solen
Ett är Polstjärnan bakom molnen
Ett är hopp och ett är tro

gick vi stigen ner till vattnet
Din hand i min hand

På botten av den sjön
Finns en silverskatt som glimmar
Och den är din i natt, så slumra in och dröm

Ett är solen
Ett är Polstjärnan bakom molnen
Ett är hopp och ett är tro

She stumbles through the tears that made her blind
   She felt such pain, some spoke in anger
Heard folks whisper, there's no place here for her kind.
    Still on she came, through the shame that flushed her face
Until at last she knelt before His feet. 
And though she spoke no words
Everything she said was heard, 
As she poured her love for the Master
From her box of Alabaster.
    And I've come to pour my praise on Him like oil 
From Mary's Alabaster Box
Don't be angry if I wash His feet with my tears 
And I dry them with my hair
You weren't there the night He found me. 
You did not feel what I felt 
When He wrapped His love all around me. 
And you don't know the cost of the oil in my Alabaster Box.
I can't forget the way life used to be. 
I was a prisoner to the sin that had me bound
I spent my days pouring my life without measure. 
Into a little treasure box I thought I found. 
   Until the day when Jesus came to me
And healed my soul with the wonder of His touch. 
So now I'm giving back to Him all the praise He's worthy of. 
I've been forgiven and that's why I love Him so much.
    And I've come to pour my praise on Him like oil 
From Mary's Alabaster Box
Don't be angry if I wash His feet with my tears 
And I dry them with my hair, …my hair.
You weren't there the night Jesus found me. 
You did not feel what I felt 
When He wrapped His love all around me. 
And you don't know the cost of the oil 
Oh, you don't know the cost of my praise. 
You don't know the cost of the oil
In my Alabaster Box.

She'll be the most beautiful bride that I've ever seen.
I can't wait to smile,
When she walks down the aisle,
On the arm of her father,
On the day that I marry your daughter.
She's been here every step since the day that we met.
Scared to death to think of what would happen if she ever left.
So don't you ever worry about me ever treating her bad.
I've got most of the vows done so far.
So bring on the better or worst, and till death do us part
There's no doubt in my mind
It's time I'm ready to start.
I swear to you with all of my heart,
I'm gonna marry your daughter,

  Closed the door - and left me blinded me by the light

Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
Then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And so you're back from outer space
I just walked in to find you here, with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock
I should have made you leave your key
If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me
Go on now, go walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Coz you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?
Oh no not I, I will survive
For as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give
I'll survive
I will survive
It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
Just trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high
And you see me, somebody new
I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
But now I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me
Go on now, go walk out the door
Just turn around now

Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
Did you think I'd crumble?
Did you think I'd lay down and die?

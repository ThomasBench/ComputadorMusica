And like me, I did

Gimme happiness when I found the fame
Gimme music that doesn't all sound the same
Gimme something that I can look forward to
Gimme humans that I can get closer to

With the rent overdue
Gimme a little bit of peace of your peace of mind
Gimme a piece of yours you'll get a piece of mine
Gimme something to do when there's nothing to do

Gimme drugs, get me sky high
Gimme headspace, set my head straight
Cut the dead weight, burn the red tape

I watched your skeleton shake all evening
And bless your heart for tryin'
Scary watchin' it wearin' off on me so fast
Last night, it was bad
She asked me come back, and then I said
""No problem"", I sent my location
She hit me four times, I was in the whip before I knew it
I wanna slow it down, but nobody would've let me if I
Coulda told her, ""Maybe if you feel out of place
It's because you are
It's because you are
It's because you are""
Chch-ch-ch-changin' right in front of me
Chch-ch-ch-cha-changin' right in front of me
Goin' through phases right in front of my face
Invitin' me to her place, I said
Chch-ch-ch-changin' right in front of me
Chch-ch-ch-cha-changin' right in front of me
Goin' through phases right in front of my face
""No problem"", I sent my location
She hit me four times, I was in the whip before I knew it
I wanna slow it down, but nobody would've let me if I
Coulda told her, ""Maybe if you feel out of place

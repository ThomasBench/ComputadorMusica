Can't even pretend like I don't want it again
On the brain all the time
Thinkin' of all the things that we did
You did somethin'
'Cause shit like this don't happen too often
It's the way you put it down
I don't want no one else around
Got me takin' a step on the wild side
Cuttin' all ties
With them other guys
Way you, way you look in my eyes
Lovin' me nice and slow
You make me wanna come through
Quarter after two
Just to put it down on you
You make me wanna replay
All of the things
That you and me, we do
You make me wanna come through
Quarter after two
Just to put it down on you
You make me wanna replay
All of the things
That you and me, we do
Look at what you make me wanna do
I'll drop all my niggas for you
Got my feelings runnin' on a loop
This ain't what I'm really used to
Before anything happens between us
Be sure you're ten toes down before I pull out this car (Pull it)
And the only thing that's comin' beside me
Out this situation is you waitin' to get some more (Oh, get it)
I told you, I'ma take you places (Whoa)
I seen it in your face (Yeah-yeah)
And I knew that you would say this
So how you wanna play this?
Yeah, you got somebody (Yeah)

     They tell me I've got something more
And oh, you could be loved
But I don't want the lights, to, find me when I'm dark, and lost
But never on my own  
'Cause I just wanna swing like Sinatra
Singing like I can't stop
'Cause I could never rock like a Rolling Stone
I just wanna live like the ones before, yeah
And maybe I could play guitar like Hendrix
Or save the world or end it and
Then maybe they'll remember me when I'm gone
That's all I could ever want
That's all I want
So I got ten minutes to be all or nothing to
Whoever wants to hear
And I got ten weeks of talking bullshit on repeat 'till I'm burnt out and disappear
But I owe you nothing
And I own my luck
Oh, they said you'll never be alone again
But I don't think you understand me or what I fear
But you could be loved
But I don't wanna lie, to, tell myself I'm more
than all the mistakes I've outrun
'Cause I'm only here for a minute
And I don't care what you say 'cause I know
You're only here cause I'm winning
But I can be my own kind of rock and roll
I don't really care if you say you don't fuck with me
And I can say what the fuck I want 'cause it's down to me
Like, oh my God, I just can't stop
'Cause I just wanna sing like Sinatra
With ethanol my soundtrack
'Cause I could never rock like a Rolling Stone
I wonder how it feels to burn out young, yeah
'Cause I just wanna die before my heart fails
From heartbreak or cocktails and
Then maybe you'll cry once you know I'm gone
That's all I could ever want
'Cause I ain't scared of livin'
No, I ain't scared of livin'
No, I ain't scared of livin'
'Cause it's all we've got
What are we breathin' for if we ain't living?
And I don't want your love
I just wanna feel like I'm still livin'
And if there is no god
I know the day I die, I lived through heaven
And that I gave it hell
At least that's living

You know, like horses, and taking dumb pictures of your feet

Yeah, I been living out the dream that you dreamt up
It's been a few years with more to come
It's been a few years since I've felt sure of what I want
And I woke up today and found that you were waiting here for me and I thought
Woah, old friend it's bittersweet
How could you do this to me?
How could you do this to me?
'Cos you are not who you think you are
There's no grain on these brown eyes, but they can be green if they really want
And I can bend your words so they say exactly what hurts the most
But silence is better than fake laughs or faking were always up, loose grip
The world bends around you
And living through cracked screens
We fall fold down to what we want
Out of love, we talk through lines, we're made of smoke
And just in time, we drift away
Diffusing light, confusing times
Growing up, or cascading down?
Cascading down
I'm hurting now
But change comes slow
If you hate what's in your head, the fuck would you speak your mind?
In search of lost time
Just 21 so I'm young and I'm stupid
Only 16, yeah I think you should've known
I think you fucked me up
I think,
I think you fucked me up
And I've got nothing to say to you
It's been a few years and I've moved on
Couldn't make it disappear, oh I tried so hard to be strong

Take care of your soul

How on you own

Losing your soul will cost you more
Than that life you're paying for

Now dream is losing is shine and
Nobody is by your side
And when the rain comes down you'll be losing your mind
So who you gonna run to, where you gonna hide
Glitter and gold won't keep you warm
On those lonely nights
And all those friends that were such a chore
Your gonna need them more than ever before

Try, try, try, try, try

45,Pray For Me,The Weeknd,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/the-weeknd/pray-for-me-chords-2305523,"I'm always ready for a war again
Go down that road again, it's all the same
I'm always ready to take a life again
You know I'll ride again, it's all the same
Tell me who's gon' save me from myself
When this life is all I know
Tell me who's gon' save me from this hell
Without you, I'm all alone
Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I'll spill this blood for you, hey
   I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left
   I fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept
   I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
   Life a living Hell, puddles of blood in the streets
   Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief
   Earthquake, the body drop, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
   Who need a hero? (hero)
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at Ground Zero? (hero)
My heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption
Their souls are sufferin' men
Clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is coming
It's all prophecy and if I gotta be sacrificed for the greater good
Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I'll spill this blood for you, hey
   Hey, hey (ahhhhh)
   Hey, hey (ahhhhh)
   Hey, hey (ahhhhh)
   Hey, hey (ahhhhh)
Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I'll spill this blood for you, hey
Just in case my faith go
I live by my own law, I live by my own law, I live by my own
Just in case my faith go
I live by my own law, I live by my own law, I live by my own

Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you

Come with the Tony Romo for clowns and all the bozos

Can't really trust nobody with all this jewelry on you
My roof look like a no-show, got diamonds by the boatload
Don't act like you my friend when I'm rollin' through my ends, though
You stuck in the friend zone, I tell her four, five, the fifth, ayy
Hunnid bands inside my shorts, DeChino the shit, ayy
Try to stuff it all in, but it don't even fit, ayy
Know that I been with the shits ever since a jit, ayy
I made my first million, I'm like, ""Shit, this is it,"" ayy
Thirty for a walkthrough, man, we had every slit, ayy
Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we gets in in the rent'
And I'm like ""woah""
Man, my neck so goddamn cold
Diamonds weigh my teeth is sore
I got homies, let it blow, oh, oh
My money thick, won't ever fold

We're hittin' lil' mamas, she wanna have my babies
Sippy on the Panky, chain so stanky
You should see the whip, promise I can take yo' bitch
Dolla ridin' in an old school Chevy, it's a drop top
Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop (ayy)
Uh, take you to the smoke shop
We gon' get high, ayy, we gon' hit Rodeo
Dolla Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums
This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright
Saint Laurent jeans, still in my Vans though
All VVS's, put you in a necklace
Girl, you look beautiful tonight
Stars on the roof, they matching with the jewelry

Who will I rely on when it's over
Took a chance with you, it made me colder
Better on my own when it's all over
So when I'm weak, who do I call?
My God it hurts, I can't be calm
What do I do?
Do I run?
Tired of hate, tired of love
I've dug my nails into my arms
She turned and left with all my scars
What is my worth?
What is my worth?
Gave my love a piece of me
She put my heart beneath her feet
She turned and left the question, ""What's my worth?""

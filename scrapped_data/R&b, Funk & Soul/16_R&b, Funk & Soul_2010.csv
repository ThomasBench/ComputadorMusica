D/A     x04232  (open A, add ""Bm7"" shape)
Would it be true to say that I ordered you?
Or is it you that ordered me? 
I could say you are the only one I see
But I can't stop at two or three... 
And I       am afraid to need you so 
And I      am too sober not to know 
That you may be my problem, not my love.... 
Would I be lying if I said you were too sweet? 
Though I'm quite sure you've got a bite 
I could say that you were just a special treat 
Though we both know that that's not right...
And I       am afraid to need you so 
And I      am too sober not to know 
That you may be my problem, not my love.... 
Cause you go down   smooth....
Would it be true to say you go to my head
Or is that sentiment too frank?
I could say you make it sweet to go to bed
But then it's you that breaks the bank...
And I       am afraid to need you so 
And I      am too sober not to know 
That you may be my problem, not my love.... 
Cause you go down   smooth....
Cause you go down   smooth....
Cause you go down   smooth....
Cause you go down   smooth....
Ohhh Would it be true, would it be true?  Ohhhh
You go down smooth, yeah you go down smooth
Would it be true...

1,Million Years Ago (ver 2),Adele,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/adele/million-years-ago-chords-1783015,"I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down I must have always known
That is would be inevitable
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
And bear my soul
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown

I remember where I couldn't even see the point
Of stepping out the mother fucking house
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

They came to far
  How many others have walked the same ground you have
  You will be wise to pay attention to your old head
  I spent the whole day throwing records in the deep end
So lets celebrate while we still can

  Where would I be without you, what would you do without me
  It would be a bad look talkin' bout what could of been

I want you, na na
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby?
I want you, na na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love,    I want you
We woke up in the kitchen saying,
""How the hell did this shit happen?""
Oh baby,       drunk in love        we be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding off in that club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love,      love
We be all night, love,      love
We be all night,
And everything alright
No complaints for my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, walking in my l'assemblage
I'm rubbing on it, rub-rubbing, if you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right
Armand de brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out like washed rags he wet up
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic 'til my voice hoarse
Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body
Been serving all this, swerve, surfing all in this good, good

That D'USSÉ is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Stumble all in the house tryna back up all of that mouth
That you had all in the car, talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be repping that third, I wanna see all the shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve
Foreplay in the foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take draws off, on site
Catch a charge I might, beat the box up like Mike
In '97 I bite, I'm Ike, Turner, turn up
Baby no I don't play, now eat the cake, Anna Mae
I'm nice,        for y'all to reach these heights we gon' need G3
4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight
We sex again in the morning, your breasts is my breakfast
We going in, we be all night
We be all night, love,      love
We be all night, love,      love
Never tired, never tired
I been sipping, that's the only thing that's keeping me on fire, me on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinking watermelon
I want your body right here, daddy I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty

Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you baby, it was easy
Comin' back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside of me

That we're making two reflections into one

Aren't you somethin', an original, cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare cause I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you, you reflect me, I love that about you

Maybe you weren't the one for me

I'll still see you in my dreams

I will be coasting, roller-coasting
I'm hoping that you'll come back to me
Moving on seems harder to do
When the one that you love moves faster than you
I gave you my all, I showed the proof of your lies
And you weren't worth it, you don't deserve me
As time passes I'm feeling high
You're not the one I'm thinking of tonight
I may not be over you, but I'll try inside

Bet right now this stings (wait a minute)

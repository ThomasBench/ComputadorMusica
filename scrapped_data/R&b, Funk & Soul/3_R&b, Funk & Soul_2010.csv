At night we're waking up the neighbours while we sing away the blues
Making sure that we're remembered yeah, cause we all matter too
If the truth has been forbidden then we're breaking all the rules
So come on come on, come on, come on
Let’s get the tv and the radio to play our tune again

Can move my mood along
But I cannot say you'll hear through my guitar

And everything will be alright
She told me that the groove is mine
It will take us through the night
And where I'll go
Can't explain I'll never know

You can't take this away from me
The way I hear the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me

All the joy that it brings
Remember skating down the road towards the park?
I can never say no
You with that summer glow
The music gives me sun when winter starts

And everything will be alright
She told me that the groove is mine

21,Set Fire To The Rain,Adele,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/adele/set-fire-to-the-rain-chords-1023270,"I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it.
It was dark and I was over,
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands they're strong,
but my knees were far too weak,
Stand in your arms
without falling to your feet,
But there's a side to you that I never knew, I never knew.
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,
And the games you'd play, you would always, always win.
But I set fire to the rain,
Watch it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried,
Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
When I'm with you
I could stay there,
Close my eyes, feel you're here forever,
You and me together, nothing is better
But there's a side to you that I never knew, I never knew.
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true,
And the games you'd play, you would always, always win.
But I set fire to the rain,
Watch it pour as I touched your face,
Well, it burned while I cried,
Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die,
Cause I knew that that was the last time, the last time
Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught, must be waiting for you,
Even now when we're already over,
I can't help myself from looking for you
I set fire to the rain,
Watch it pour as I touch your face,
Well, it burned when I cried,
Cause I heard it screaming your name, your name
I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames
Where I felt something die,
Cause I knew that was the last time, the last time, oh, oh
Let it burn!
Let it burn!

 I won't say a word
 They've all been said before, you know
 So why don't we just play pretend
 Like when I'm scared of what is coming next
 Or scared of having nothing left
 Look, don't get me wrong, I know
 There is no tomorrow
 All I ask is 
 If this is my last night with you
 hold me like I'm more than just a friend
 give me a memory I can use
 take me by the hand
 while we do what lovers do
 it matters how this ends
 'Cause what If I never love again?
 I don't need
 Your honesty
 it's already in your eyes
 and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
 No one knows me like you do
 and since you're the only one that matters
 tell me, who do I run to?
 Look, don't get me wrong, I know
 There is no tomorrow
 All I ask is 
 If this is my last night with you
 hold me like I'm more than just a friend
 give me a memory I can use
 take me by the hand

 let this be the way we remember us
 I don't want to be cruel or vicious 
 And I ain't asking for forgiveness

And you kiss me on the dance floor
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't it be like that, cause I'm yours
We keep behind closed doors
Every time I see you, I die a little more
Stolen moments that we steal as the curtain falls
It'll never be enough
It's obvious you're meant for me
Every piece of you it just fits perfectly
Every second every thought I'm in so deep
But I'll never show it on my face
But we know this, we got a love that is hopeless
Why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that I could be like that
Why can't we be like that? Cause I'm yours
When you’re with him, do you call his name, 
Like you do when you’re with me, Does it feel the same?
Would you leave if I was ready to settle down?
Or would you play it safe and stay
Girl you know this, we got a love that is hopeless
Why can't you hold me in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that it could be like that
Why can't we be like that? Cause I'm yours
And nobody knows, I’m in love with someone’s baby   (him)
I don’t wanna hide us away   (her)
Tell the world about the love we making   (him)
I’m living for that day, Someday   (her)
Why can't I hold you in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that we could be like that
Why can't we be like that? Cause I'm yours, I’m yours
Why can't I hold you in the street?
Why can't I kiss you on the dance floor?
I wish that we could be like that
Why can't we be like that? Cause I'm yours
Why can't I say that I'm in love?

I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put

I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her
I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee, or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters, from nights we don't remember
  Do you miss me like I miss you?
  Fucked around and got attached to you
  Friends can break your heart too, and
I'm always tired but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this real out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text but then I never mind that shit
I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
If you wanted me you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go
I don't mean no harm
I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
  You ever wonder what we coulda been?
  You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
  Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
  Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts, and I should stop reminiscing 
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
Everyone I do right does me wrong

And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young
This I know, (yeah) this I know
She told me, ""Don't worry about it”
She told me, ""Don't worry no more”
We both knew we can't go without it
She told me you'll never be alone oh oh oooh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you, but I love it, but I love it
I can't feel my face when I'm with you, but I love it, but I love it
And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come
All the misery was necessary when we're deep in love
This I know, yes I know, and I know
She told me, ""Don't worry about it”
She told me, ""Don't worry no more”
We both knew we can't go without it
She told me you'll never be alone oh oh oooh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you, but I love it, but I love it
I can't feel my face when I'm with you, but I love it, but I love it
I can't feel my face when I'm with you, but I love it, but I love it

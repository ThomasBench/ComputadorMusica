0,Dance Around It,Lucius,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lucius/dance-around-it-chords-4180561,"   Waiting for the right time
Will it ever be the right time?
Is it ever gonna feel right
   All the little white lies
Just keeping up the good times
It's weighing down on my mind
Sweep that under the rug
Got a whole lotta space
I just touch myself
And we'll keep dancing
Above, underground
We'll keep dancing around it
Dancing
Our love's burning out
We'll keep dancing around it
   Underneath a pink sky
Could be another lonely night
Just follow the escape sign
Sweep that under the rug
Got a whole lotta space
I just touch myself
And we'll keep dancing
Above, underground
We'll keep dancing around it
Dancing
Our love's burning out
We'll keep dancing around it
Dancing
Above, underground
We'll keep dancing around it
Dancing
Our love's burning out
We'll keep dancing around it
   We'll keep dancing around it (We'll keep dancing)
   We'll keep dancing around it (We'll keep dancing)
We'll keep dancing
Above, underground
We'll keep dancing around it
Dancing
Our love's burning out
Keep dancing around now
We'll keep dancing
Above, underground
We'll keep dancing around it
Dancing
Our love's burning out
We'll keep dancing around it
Dancing
Above, underground
We'll keep dancing around it
Dancing
Our love's burning out
We'll keep dancing around it

With a hundred thoughts
Maybe he knows who I am
      probably not
She walks down the hall with her head down low
Scared to meet his eyes
Even when she hears his voice
She's swarmed with butterflies
It's impossible
To get you off my mind
I think about a hundred thoughts
And you are 99
I’ve understood
That you will never be mine
And that's fine
I'm just breaking inside
He always walks the crowded halls
And is blinded by this light
A girl who keeps her head down low
And never shows her eyes
He's tried to talk to her
But there's no easy way
'Cause every time he raises his voice
She runs away
Oh it's impossible
To get you off my mind
I think about a hundred thoughts
And you are 99
I've understood
That you will never be mine
And that's fine
I'm just breaking inside
And one day
Maybe she'll stay
And start to head over his way
And one day
She'll look into his eyes
And instead of breaking
She'll call him mine
One day
He'll grab her by the waist
And force them to meet
Face to face
And one day
He'll look into her eyes
And say that you're my only light
Oh it's impossible
To get you off my mind
I think about a hundred thoughts
And you are 99
I've understood
That you will never be mine
And that's fine,

Shining through the curtains.
The time before the night,
When everything’s golden.
You’re sitting on the chair,
Wrapped inside a bedsheet,
Playing with your hair,
Watching people on the high street.
If I wished myself a superpower,
I would make this moment last for hours.
If I had my will,
Time would just stand still,
Wait for me until,
I find some magic film,
To take a photograph,
The sun is going down,
Your skin is like a painting.
The light is perfect now,
I can feel it changing.
Kids are probably soon,
Don’t get me wrong I’m ready.
I know what to do,
When we’re no longer two,
When us means more than me and you.
Oh, If I wished myself a superpower,
I would make this moment last for hours.
If I had my will,
Time would just stand still,
Wait for me until,
I find some magic film,
To take a photograph,
I need some way to prove this was real,
A memory is not enough.
I’m scared that I’ll forget the way it feels,
To be young, and in love.
Let me stay right here,
Just a moment longer.
The picture is so clear,
Please let this last forever.

Don't leave the house at midnight and expect the birds to sing

You can't conjure up more money if you've only got a dime
No use praying for your younger days if you're running out of time
You can take a horse to water, but you can't teach fish to fly
Sometimes, it's time to let a good thing die
You can't light a fire from nothing, or clap and make snow fall
You can't summon love up in your heart if it isn't there at all
Life isn't like the movies, but it sure will make you cry
When it dawns on you it's time to say goodbye
You can't drum up the heartbeats of loved ones come to pass
Stop wishing for forever 'cause nothing ever lasts
If it's keeping you from sleeping, wipe the tear from your eye

And are you just a poison that I shouldn’t use?
Wish I could say to you

Wait until we’re older
But I might be somebody
You might not even know her
I’m going through changes
It’s a rollercoaster

And months would flutter by
And fears would all have fled
And it'll all be fine
At least that's what you said
Whoa
I want to buy a house
I want to make a stand
I want to love a girl
I want to love a man
I want to kill the past
I want to stop the sand
I want another chance
But one is all you have
But if once more I could feel
What I felt before
I'd hold it like it's real
I'd never let it fall
I'd blow up every bridge
I'd build up every wall
And nothing could get in
But nothing could be born
Whoa
Whoa
And everything looks nice
Nothing is unwell
But once the fruit of God
Forever live in hell
And once you choose a side
There's nothing left to win
And once a lover dies
You never love again

43,Here We Go… Again,The Weeknd,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/4018303,"  Strike a pose with my kinfolk
Front page of the billboards
Suit and tie, and cigar smokes
Macallan shots 'til it burn throats
We still celebrating Super Bowl
Ring froze like it's February
XO, that's a mercenary
Used to sing on lofts
But now we cruising on a yacht, we clear, yeah
Said you wanted your boyfriend jealous with a couple pics
And you didn't expect to fall for me once you got this dick
Your girlfriend's tryna pair you with somebody more famous
But instead you ended up with someone so basic, faceless
Someone to take your pictures and frame it
And my new girl, she a movie star
I loved her right, make her scream like Neve Campbell
But when I make her laugh, swear it cures my depressing thoughts
'Cause baby girl, she a movie star
Baby girl, she a movie star
I told myself that I'd never fall
Ooh oo
Oh
Here we go again
Life's a dream
'Cause it's never what it seems
But you'd rather love and lost with tears
Than never love at all
So here we go again
Although this love is strong to me
We don't know how it's gonna be
Forever is too long to me
We don't need the government involved because we like to touch
We don't need no damn religion telling us that we in love
But if we did crush down the road, spending lawyer fees up
Pen and pack gon' save my ass if these feelings freeze up
You gon' sign this prenup, you gon' sign this prenup
You gon' sign this prenup, you gon' sign this prenup
Ooh oo
Oh
Here we go again
Life's a dream
'Cause it's never what it seems
But you'd rather love and lost with tears
Than never love at all
So here we go again

Although she has another, i can't have another for i'm not free

Upon my knees to her i'm creeping
My very life is in her keeping

And you made me love you
Take the shackles of love away

As you wave to her good-bye. That's why...

Say 'em loud, say 'em clear for the whole round world to hear.
I wish I could share all the love that's in my heart,
Remove all the bars that keep us apart.
I wish you could know what it means to be me
Then you'd see and agree that every man should be free.

I wish I could live like I'm longing to live.
I wish that I could do all the things that I can do
Though I'm way o - ver - due, I'd be start - ing anew.

How sweet it would be if I found I could fly!

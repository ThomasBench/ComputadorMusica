0,Homeless (ver 2),Leona Lewis,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/leona-lewis/homeless-chords-703168,"Waiting here for you to call me
for you to tell me
that everything's a big mistake
waiting here in this rainfall
feeling so small
this dream was not supposed to break
i'm so sorry now
for the pain i cost you
won't you please forgive
but you don't love me anymore
you don't want me anymore
there's a sign on your door
no vacancy, just emptiness
without your love, i'm homeless
in this cold i'm walking aimless
feeling helpless
without a shelter from the storm
and in my heart i miss you so much
I'm missing your touch
and the bed that used to be so warm
i'm so sorry now
for the pain i cost you
won't you please forgive
but you don't love me anymore
you don't want me anymore
there's a sign on your door
no vacancy, just emptiness
without your love, i'm homeless
Oh my baby, i'm sorry, i'm sorry
but you don't love me anymore
you don't want me anymore
there's a sign on your door
no vacancy, just emptiness
without your love, i'm homeless

 I didn't know where to turn to
See somehow I cant forget you

Go in, come in
Who's there? No one
Thinking that I deserved it
Now I realize that I really didn't know
You didn't notice, you mean everything
Quickly im learning, to love again
All i know is, I will be ok
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too
It'll all get better in time
Even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time
How could I turn on the tv
Without something there to remind me
Was it all that easy
To just put aside your feelings
If I'm dreaming
Don't wanna let, hurt my feelings
But thats the path, I believe in
And I know that, time will heal it
You didn't notice, you mean everything

They will never see the light of day, cause I'll never take them out
There's no turning back, it's for the better
Baby I deserve more then empty words and promises
I believed every thing you said, and I gave you the best I had
So take a bow, 'cause you've taken everything else
You played the part, like a star you played it so well
Take a bow, 'cause the scene is coming to an end
I gave you love, all you gave me was pretend, 
so now take a bow 
   The future's about to change, before you know it,
The curtain closes, take a look around,
There's no one in the crowd, I'm throwing away the pain,
And you should know that your preformance made me strong enough
So take a bow, 'cause you've taken everything else
You played the part, like a star you played it so well
Take a bow, 'cause the scene is coming to an end
I gave you love, all you gave me was pretend, 
so now take a bow 
   Well it must have been slight of hand, 'cause I still can't understand
Why I could never see, just what a fool believes
   But the lies they start to show, tell me how does it feel to know, 
right now That I wont be around
   so baby before it happen to you
   take a bow, 'cause you've taken everything else

Take a bow, 'cause the scene is coming to an end
I gave you love, all you gave me was pretend,

And the moon and the stars    were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the empty skies.
    And the first time   ever I kissed your mouth
   I felt the earth move in my hands
Like the trembling heart      of a captive bird
That was there at my command, my love.
   And the first time    ever I lay with you
   I felt your heart so close to mine
And I knew our joy     would fill the earth
  And last and last and last till the end of time my love

  Your face,   your face

The meek shall inherit the earth

That you're people been in?
Who said that water
Is a precious commodity
Then dropped a big old black oil slick
In the deep blue sea?
Who told me, Mr. Man
That working round the clock
Would buy me a big house in the 'hood
With cigarette ads on every block
Who told me Mr. Man
That I got a right to moan?
How 'bout this big ol' hole in the ozone?

37,Weve Had Enough,Michael Jackson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/michael-jackson/weve-had-enough-chords-979747," Love was taken from a young life
 And no one told her why
 Her direction has a dimlight 
 From one more violent crime
 She innocently questioned why,
 Why her father had to die
 She asked the men in blue 
 How is it that you get to choose,
 Who will live and who will die
 Did God say that you could decide?
 You saw he didn't run 
 And that my daddy had no gun.
 In the middle of a village.
 Way in a distant land
 Lies a poor boy with his broken toy 
 Too young to understand.
 He's awaken, ground is shakin
 His father grabs his hand
 Screaming, crying, his wife's dying
 Now he's left to explain.
 He innocently questioned why
 Why his mother had to die
 What did these soldiers come here for?
 If they're for peace, why is there war? 
 Did God say that they could decide
 Who will live and who will die?
 All my mama ever did 
 Was try to take care of her kids.
 We're innocently standing by 
 Watching people lose their lives
 It seems as if we have no voice
 It's time for us to make a choice
 Only God could decide
 Who will live and who will die
 There's nothing that can't be done
 If we raise our voice as one.
 They've gotta hear it from me
 They've gotta hear it from you
 They've gotta hear it from us
 We can't take it. We've already had enough.
 They've gotta hear it from me
 They've gotta hear it from you
 They've gotta hear it from us
 We can't take it. We've already had enough.
 They've gotta hear it from me
 They've gotta hear it from you
 They've gotta hear it from you, baby
 We can't take it. We've already had enough.
 Deep in your soul and let God decide
 It's up to me and i'm still alive 
 They've gotta hear it from us
 We can't take it. We've already had enough.
 It's going down baby. 
 Just let God decide. 
 It's going on baby. 
 Just let God decide.
 Deep in my soul baby, 
 We've already had enough.
 They've gotta hear it from me
 They've gotta hear it from you
 They've gotta hear it from us
 We can't, we can't. We've already had enough.
 We've all ready had enough.
 They gotta take it from me,
 ask my brother, its too much for me.
 Ask my brother baby.
 Ask my mother, We've already had enough.

It's got to sound good to me inside
I just think about it
I'm so undemanding
Cause they say love is blind
I've lived this life pretending
I can bear this hurt deep inside
The truth is I'm been longing
A love that's so divine
I've searched this whole world wishing
She'll be there time after time
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out
A heart that needs your love
I've lived my life the lonely
A soul that cries of shame
With handicapped emotions
Save me now from what still remains
I'll be your story hero
A serenading ryne
I'm just needing that someone
Save me now from the path I'm on
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out
A heart that needs your love
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out
A heart that needs your love
When you say we will dance 'til the light of day
It's just like the children running with joy
When we pray will you promise me you'll always stay
It's because I'm needing that someone
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out
A heart that needs your love

 Away from all this madness
 I'll give you a piece of me
 If you'll give me a moment
 To let you into the corners of my mind
 I looked into a stranger
And found my soul waiting there
It hit me like a siren
To see myself everywhere
 And I saw that I knew him
Like the corners of my mind
And like every other soul
You feel the night come on hard and go slow
And life goes on and on and it goes
In the corners of my mind
So shed your skin for me
 Let's pull back the covers
 There's so much about ourselves
We're yet to discover
 So won't you let me in to
Won't you let me into
The corners of your mind
 We pass on chance with our eyes to the ground
 It only takes a minute to see what's around
 But instead we choose to reside in
The corners of our minds
 So I stand before you now
 Faulty but not broken
 Fragile like the break of day
 And sometimes sad like words unspoken
 But I'll let you in
I'll let you in to the corners of my mind
And like every other soul
You feel the night come on hard and go slow
And life goes on and on and it goes
In the corners of my mind
 Living in the corners of our minds, oh
 Living in the corners of our minds, oh
 Living in the corners of our minds, oh
 Living in the corners of our minds, oh

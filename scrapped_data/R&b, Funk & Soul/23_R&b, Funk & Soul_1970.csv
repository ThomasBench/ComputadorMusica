color of cafe' au lait, made the

Now I look to greet the stars but there's no stars to see
I'm gonna search this world until I find my destiny
If it's the rich life I don't want it
Happiness ain't always material things
I want destiny
It's the place for me
Give me the simple life
I'm getting away from here
Let me be me
C'mon let me feel free
Let me be me
I wanna get far from here
Or should I up and fly away so fancy free, yeah
Nobody can change my mind
The words of destiny are calling me wild time
I want destiny
It's the place for me
Ah, destiny
You and me
Should we fly away
Ah, destiny
So fancy free
Ah, destiny

'Round the Fourth of July
The breeze was standing still
I'm hanging out by myself
And I'm having a good time
With the folk inside my head
And you know, Lord
How you did a lovely thing
See, times my head is lighter
Than it's ever been
And anyone who's ever had
Sweet potato pie, really
Don't want pumpkin again
No, they don't want pumpkin again
'Cause it don't taste right, no
Look-a-here city boy with your
Silks and braided hair
Don't you let nobody fool you
With no imitation nothing
Tell 'em, say, unh, unh, buddy
I been there
Listen mama, when you
Finally walk on in
Don't forget to bring along
Your sweet potato tin
'Cause when you serve him
A slice of your sweet potato
Sin, girl, he won't want pumpkin again
Really, no, he won't want it again 
Now I took a trip down to Sissy's
She's a friend of mine
She smiled and asked me in
Well, she drew a box and a big
Fancy question mark
Said, ""Brother, which one is you in?""
I told her, ""Sister, don't worry
'bout the mule going blind
You just sit in the wagon and
Hold on to the line
'Cause anyone who's ever had
Sweet potato pie
Don't want pumpkin again
Really don't want it again
Goog God, Now I saw the gates
Gold and pearl
And I sat right down
In a dream of you, old friend
I'm thinking some milk and
Honey and a pot of stew
Might fill that gap again
You know, I'm a thankful
Witness to the things I've seen
And times my head is lighter
Than it's ever been
Sweet potato pie
Really don't want pumpkin again
No they won't want

We spent the night in Frisco
At every kind of disco
And from that night I kissed,Our love goodbye 
                Don't blame it on moonlight
                Don't blame it on good times
                Blame it on the boogie....
That nasty boogie bugs me
But somehow it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm gets me, On my feet
I've changed my life completely
I've seen the lightning leave me
My baby just can't take, Her eyes off me
                Don't blame it on moonlight
                Don't blame it on good times
                Blame it on the boogie....
                I just can't, I just can't
                I just can't control my feet
                Don't blame it on moonlight
                Don't blame it on good times
                Blame it on the boogie....
This magic music grooves me
That dirty rhythm moves me
The devil's gotten to me, Through this dance
I'm full of funky fever
And fire burns inside me
Boogie's got me in a, Super trance
                Don't blame it on moonlight
                Don't blame it on good times
                Blame it on the boogie....
(x2)    Sunshine, Moonlight, Good times, Boogie

Moonlight (You just wanna)
Boogie (blame it on yourself)
Sunshine (Ain't nobody's fault)
Moonlight (But yours and that boogie)
Good times (all night long)

What kept Papa so far behind
What in the world was holding my Daddy down?
Papa always dropped his head
Lord, he seemed so afraid
Like he was carryin' a heavy burden all the time
There was a man up in the big house
But Papa was afraid to speak out
The man kept my Daddy's nose right on the ground
Girl, your Papa he was mighty good
He was doin' the best he could
All his life he lived just for you
But twelve kids, he had a heavy load
He couldn't walk the front road
On his face he always wore a frown
It was for you and the others too
He was tryin' to make it through
He had to take the back road into town
Every year your Papa would say
""Next year, we gonna move away
I wanna take my children away from here""
He said ""I've almost lost my fear
I think I see my way clear
I'm gonna take a stand and be a man""
But then the man would come from the big house
Daddy would always back out
And end right up again behind the plow
But twelve kids, he had a heavy load
He couldn't walk the front road
On his face he always wore a frown
It was for you and the others too
He was tryin' to make it through
He had to take the back road into town
When he finally made up his mind
Your Daddy had wasted too much time
Your Papa just put it off a little too long
'Cause all the years that Papa was sleepin'
Father Time kept right on creepin'
'Til it was time for him to lay his body down
He did it all against his will
He got lost back in them fields
My Daddy never made it into town

He couldn't walk the front road
On his face he always wore a frown
It was for you and the others too
He was tryin' to make it through
He had to take the back road into town

48,Synthetic World,Swamp Dogg,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/swamp-dogg/synthetic-world-chords-3686132,"Hey you,   I'm up from the bayou,
Where wildlife runs free,
You could say that I'm country.
But let me tell you what I see.
Your world is plastic.
Can see through to the otherside.
Your cities are made of wood,
Antiques are what you've got inside.
Houses are paper but folks don't hear a word you say.
Friendship's like acid it buurns as it slides away.
So you seeeee, my patience is growin' thin.
With this synthetic woooorld we're livin' in.
The word immitation'll lead us 'cross the nation
What's real has become a freak
Someone's tryin' to make me weak.
Strange initials to keep me blind.
Psychedelic music to blow my mind.
So you seeeee, my patience is growin' thin.
With this synthetic woooorld we're livin' in.
Spray to clear the air and its filled with spray.
Makin people die every day
Now I find I'm out of place
If I only have one face
All my friends have more than two
No longer must you be you
They found out how to transplant
Maybe has replaced can
So you seeeee, my patience is growin' thin.
With this synthetic woooorld we're livin' in.   hmmm

Somehow I just don't get excited like I used to   just to stand before your door
Even though you broke my dreams   and destroyed my will to give
I cannot wait I won't refuse      I'll not forget but I'll forgive
Put it back the way it was     put it back that way because
You have broke the faithful heart   and you've torn it all apart
You let me down     when it was up to you
Once you gave me sunny mornin's   we were happy then that way
You were warm and sweet and lovin'     I wanted nothin'  but to stay
Now I ain't comin'  back forever   but I'm comin'  back for more
Keep your grievin'  invitations     go on eat your heart outside your door
Put it back the way it was     put it back that way because
You have broke the faithful heart   and you've torn it all apart
You let me down     when it was up to you
Put it back the way it was     put it back that way because
You have broke the faithful heart   and you've torn it all apart
You let me down     when it was up to you
Oh  you let me down     oh  and it's up to you
Oh  I'm feelin'  down     oh  and it's up to you

Knowing I'm better than you'll ever be
I liked a picture of you and your missus
It's cool to see you're out there getting bitches
Funny how sometimes you'd try hitting me up
Clearly your new girl, she is just not enough
Seems you've finally found a replacement
Bet when she's in your bed she fakes it
What a shame, your girl's so plain
Hope she stays the hell a--way
What a shame, your girl's so plain
Hope she stays the hell a--way
You went out with that?
You went out with that?
You went out with that?
You went out with that?
I was dumb to give you my love
We had some fun, but it was never enough
You've got these traits and they're just so unappealing
I should have left when I first had that feeling
Back when we met, I was a terrible mess (Terrible mess)
Maybe you're not ready for this conversation
That's why I'm out of the equation
What a shame, your girl's so plain
Hope she stays the hell a--way
What a shame, your girl's so plain
Hope she stays the hell a--way
Oh, you into them plain Janes now?
Showing her off, she ain't even all that
They be watching me like television
Niggas actin' different, I'ma lose my interest
She can't fuck with my dips and my curves (Ha-ha)
You gon' learn, I'm the ex you ain't deserve
Still in my DMs, boy you got some nerve, so absurd
Burstin' bubbles everytime I'm poppin' shit
What a shame, your girl's so plain
Hope she stays the hell a--way
What a shame, your girl's so plain
Hope she stays the hell a--way
You went out with that?
You went out with that?
You went out with that?
You went out with that?

  On the third day, yeah, You rose up
And you beat death once and for all (Once and for all)

Sometimes this world is feeling crazy
At times my mind is feeling hazy
But Lord You always come and save me
God Almighty, my safety
You're my end, You're my new beginning
You're my home, The One I confide in
You're the very air I breathe
The reason that I sing
Oh, I've tried it all

Why? Why is there nobody like Jesus?
As in billion of mens and women lived on this planet
But why, why are we convinced there's nobody like Jesus?
Was He not merely a teacher, a prophet
An exegeter, an explainer and yet we find ourselves in history wondering
""Is there anyone like Jesus?
Who is this Jesus?""
This Man from the Middle East who claims to be God
Is He God? Is He sinless? Is He perfection?
Is He the once and for all sacrifice for humanity?
Is He a man without fear?
Did He become sin so that you and I might be right in our relationship with God
Is there nobody like Jesus?
Did He die between two criminals on the crucifixion?
Three days later did He rise again as the grave empty?
Has He defeated death, Hell in the grave and sin itself?
If so there is nobody like Jesus (Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus)

 That’s when I start to wonder
Where do I fit in?

You say the past is behind me and it’ll be alright
  And you say to me,
It’ll be alright
When I’m all alone and
Fear is all I see
Sitting in the silence with these insecurities
It's then You remind me, You’re holding me tight
And You love me completely, You're always by my side
And you say to me
It’ll be alright
  I know you’re not a GOD out there hiding on mountains,   oh no
 You come right where I am, lost my way but You found me
Like the rain in the dark on my ugliest days
You say that You’ll always love me just the same
And then You remind me that You’re holding me tight

And you say to me
It’ll be alright

vergessen zu viel gekocht und zu wenig
gegessen zu viel Zeit zu
verlier`n alleine
spazieren alleine passieren die Dinge auch jetzt nicht mehr
denn alles zu zweit nicht ist
zu weit ich wache auf mit dir
ein erster Blick in mir
das Zweite das ich mache mache ich mit dir
ein Kuss ein Spruch und lachen
aufstehn, duschen einfach machen
Tag planen und sich zurück lassen
vermissen und etwas abmachen
eine Nachricht lesen, gleich zurückschreiben
dich abholen, in deine Arme treiben
Wärme fühlen, keine Spiele spielen

zweit ich möchte zuhör´n und etwas

고단한 눈꺼풀에 마지막까지 담겨있던 건 넌데
모두 너였었는데
 기억 끝에 남아 점점 의미를 잃어가
지금 아니면 난 말할 수 없을 것 같아
모진 말들을 준비하는 게
나도 쉽지가 않아
내일의 너는 어떤 표정을 하고 있을까
오늘의 나는 이미 알고 있는지도 몰라
숨길 수조차 없는 이기적인 나의 마음을
이제는 모른 척할 수가 없는 걸
사소했던 말들에 자꾸 감정만 앞서고
불안한 눈동자에 서로 할 말을 삼켜내는 일 모두
어울리지도 맞지도 않는 걸
알잖아 너무 많이 변했단 걸
미안하지만 난 좀 더 잘 지낼 것 같아
다시 웃으며 우리 추억은 모두 덜어내려 해
내일의 너는 어떤 표정을 하고 있을까
오늘의 나는 이미 알고 있는지도 몰라
숨길 수조차 없는 이기적인 나의 마음을
이제는 모른 척할 수가 없는 걸
더 이상은
잘 지내란 마음에 없는 말은 안 할래
이런 말들이 우리를 더 아프게 만들 테니
처음과 마지막 함께해줘 고마워
너의 이름과 따스함을 지울게
내일의 나는 후회하고 힘들지도 몰라
또 오늘의 난 우리의 기억에 눈물이 나
메울 수조차 없이 틈이 생긴 나의 마음을
이제는 모른 척할 자신 없는 걸
나에게만 주었던 따뜻함이 참 좋았고

My heavy eyes, I can never seem to close 'em
My running mind just can't catch you when it's goin'
Is it late at night or is it early in the mornin'?
Only so many sheep a girl can count, patchouli candles burnin' out
I try to meditate it all away but damn, it is too quiet now
Daylight helps distract my head, monsters hide under my bed
They bother me with all kinds of things like ""where do I go when I'm dead?""
Is it too much to ask for a sweet dream?
Need a step back from my feelings
Life is not so bad when I'm sleeping
Is it too much to ask, too much to ask for a
  Sweet dream
   For a sweet dream
6:58, sun's peakin' through the curtains
I drift away, suddenly the wheels are turnin'
Songs are in my head, scary thoughts begin to worsen
Once I'm wide awake, it's too hard to reverse it
Chirpin' birds are flying 'round my house, patchouli candles burnin' out
I try to meditate it all away but damn, it is too quiet now
Daylight helps distract my head, monsters hide under my bed
They bother me with all kinds of things like that one stupid thing I said

Sandman can you visit me?
All I want is a sweet dream
8:31, I'm slurrin' every word now
I pray this cold coffee helps me with the rebound
How does everybody I know, know how to sleep sound?
When we're all a mess, I guess the only way out is a

    Thinking about what used to be
    Now in my dreams I see reality (Boo-yeah)
    I hear the whole world talking at once
    Talk as one
    Let me in, shake me out of my shell
    I wanna feel like myself again
When I see you
I come back to life
Lying in your hands, baby, victory is mine
When you grab me
Hands to the sky
I'm in love with your kindness
In love with the mystery
You and I, we were meant to be
It's algorithm, baby (Algorithm, baby)
And if I'm lost in the darkness
I'm sure that you will come search for me
I'm in love with your kindness (Oh-oh, oh oh)
It's algorithm, algorithm, algorithm, baby
  We're in love with the starpower
  In love with the pure serenity
  Whole world might be burnin' up
  But we're holdin' up
  Give us star power
  We're in love with the starpower
  In love with the pure serenity
  Whole world might be burnin' up
  But we're holdin' up
  Give us starpower
                      Boo-yeah

No, I don't have a change of heart
I'm picking up every message left on read
Got nothing to hide but a thorn in my side
I guess we could be in touch (yeah)
Riding around by ourselves
'Til we fall apart
Our health and safety is good
Why can't you tell
It's easy to remember
A day before November?
All we had was time
But lately
You been on my mind
And I been acting crazy
Been crazy without you
I know I'll be just fine
I'm just another risk away
I push you around
'Cause I don't wanna face you
I fuck up again
'Cause I don't wanna take two
You calling me out
'Cause you know what we been through
I'm just another big mistake
But lately
You been on my mind
And I been acting crazy
Been crazy without you
I know I'll be just fine
I'm just another risk away
But lately
Been crazy without you
There's nothing to do
My heart is in two places
But lately
Been crazy without you
There's nothing to do
My heart is in two places...

Somewhere up New York ways
where the people are so gay,
Twisting the night away
Here they have a lot of fun,
Putting trouble on the run
Man there ain't nothing like,
Twisting the night a-way
Twisting, Twisting
Twisting, twisting
They're twisting the night a-way
Here's a man in evening clothes,
How he got here I don't know
Man you gotta see him go,
Twisting the night away
He's dancing with a chick in slacks,
This chick's moving up and back
Man, there ain’t nothing like,
Twisting the night a-way!
Twisting, Twisting
Twisting, twisting
They're twisting the night a-way
Lean up
Lean back
Lean up
Lean back
Wa-tusi
Fly
Now twist
They're twisting the night a-way
Here's a fella in blue jeans,
He's dancing with an older queen
Chick's dolled up in diamond ring,
Twisting the night away
Man you gotta see her go,
Twisting to the rock'n'roll
Man, there ain't nothing like,
Twisting the night a-way
Twisting, Twisting
Twisting, twisting
They're twisting the night a-way
Lean up
Lean back
Lean up
Lean back
Wa-tusi

  I found a thrill... to press my cheek to,
  A thrill that I... could never have known.
  You smiled.....and then the spell was cast,
  And here we are in heaven,
 For you are mine at last.

 I wake up feeling sorry I met you;
 Hoping soon, that I'll for-get you.
When I look in the mirror and comb my hair,
 Nowhere to run to, baby; nowhere to hide.
 Nowhere to run to, baby; nowhere to hide.
 I know you're no good for me,
 But you've become a part of me.
 How can I fight a lover; that shouldn't be?
When it's, so deep, so    deep,
 Deep inside of me.
My love reaches so high; I can't get over it.
 Nowhere to run,  nowhere to hide, from you, baby.
 Just can't get a-way from you, baby;
 No matter how I try.
 I know you're no good for me;
 But free of you, I'll never be.
 Nowhere to run to, baby; nowhere to hide.
 Nowhere to run to, baby; nowhere to hide.

One rainy April Monday
Smiling soft and warm as on
A clear December Sunday
Wearing taffeta and lace
That matched her braided hair
With their coraled beads that sang to me
She said ""hi"" and asked me why
Was I looking with sorrow
When there were much brighter days
In store for me tomorrow
I looked up at her and smiled
And said, why I don't know
But would she agree, to stay with me
And she said
Never in your sun, she said
Never in your sun, then she said
I will only come
In your pouring rain to relieve the pain
So if you are at lover's park
And someone looks with sorrow
Ask them why are they so sad
When sunshine's theirs tomorrow
They'll reply they don't know why
And ask you please to stay
Until the end of time, and when they're fine
Be kind and say
Never in your sun, just tell them
Never in your sun, then say
I will only come
In your pouring rain, to relieve the pain, never, ever
Never in your sun, never in your sun, believe that

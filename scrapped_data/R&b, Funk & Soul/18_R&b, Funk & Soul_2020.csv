Easy as I want to, there's just no one better
You think it's calculated, baby, I'm just not that clever, never
  And what could I say? I knew that it would go this way
Or could you blame it on fate? I couldn't let it just escape
Now at the end of our days, I'll run back thoughts of you
Thoughts of you keep me up at night
Up at night, up at night
Thoughts of you keep me up at night
Up at night, up at night
  I think about all of the ways you turn me on (Turn me on)
 And my bed gets lonely whenever you're gone
  But, baby, I'm a wreck without you
 All I do is fantasize about you (You)
 You'rе the light of my life, you're my mеanin'
  And even when the sun don't shine
I'll be right by your side, holdin' you tight (You tight)
  And when you feel like nobody cares
I'll be right there to remind you that
You keep me up at night
Up at night, up at night
Thoughts of you keep me up at night
Up at night, up at night
  And what could I say? I knew that it would go this way
Or could you blame it on fate? I couldn't let it just escape

Will it ever be the right time?
Is it ever gonna feel right
   All the little white lies

It's weighing down on my mind
Sweep that under the rug
Got a whole lotta space
I just touch myself
And we'll keep dancing
Above, underground
We'll keep dancing around it
Dancing
Our love's burning out
We'll keep dancing around it

Could be another lonely night
Just follow the escape sign
Sweep that under the rug

Unti-unting naglalapit
Ang ating mga mundo
Pag-asa ay ating bitbit
Maligaya’t walang takot
Ang saya at pagsinta’y
Tila walang kapantay
Inaabangan ang bawat pagtagpo
Walang mintis ang tuwa
Sating dalawa
Hinamak ang lahat
Unti unting nawawala
Ang iyong mga salita
Dahan dahang naglalaho
Ang lahat ng pangako
Napapansing lumalayo
Ang 'iyong tingin
Di na alam ang dapat kong gawin
Tuluyan ka na bang mawawala sa 'kin
Ang tamis at aruga
Na laganap sa simula
Ngayo'y nabaon na
Sa puso't isip na mapait
'Di na maibabalik
Sa unang araw.
Ang pait at ang sakit
Na dati'y wala naman
Ngayon ay hindi na mailagan
Ang tanong na walang sagot
Luha ang nadudulot
Sa ating mga mata
Hahanap-hanapin
Ang mga bulong sa gabi
Woooohhh
Ulit-ulitin
Ang bawat kwento at sikreto natin
Hanggang wala na
Ang luha sa puso ko
Hanggang sa muli

I'm just tryna catch the train before it has to leave the station
Packin' no bags, nothin' but the clothes on my back
With a Cognac, let me sip it, tryin' to relax
Red wine up in my glass, plus Filet Mignon

Yeah, it's me against the world, I guess I'll take them on
I might stop and see my girl, but I ain't stayin' long
What if I'm gone, what the fuck you gon' think then?
I told my story, put my life inside this ink pen
Said I'll make it big when everybody know me
Well, I made it big and everybody phony, ha
So could you pour me? I need a cup
No, none of that liquor, mix in purple stuff
I could talk my pain, but would it hurt too much?
Go 'head, judge me, hate cost money, but this love free
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Lookin' at the sky, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Lookin' at the street, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
What the, what the fuck is time? (Ha)
Ask 'em, what the fuck is time? (I don't know)
What the fuck is time? I ask 'em, what the fuck is time?
What do you do when you think you could be a icon?
'Cause all these people get to screamin' when the lights on
Like they just seen a ghost, earn my stripes, zebra coat
Racin' to the gate but my flight gone
And now these writers takin' shots without a Nikon
But I don't fight though, figure it's a typo
Seems we in some shit now, gonna be alright though
Potion in my Sprite, then my night slows down, down (ha)
See, that's exactly what I need
My khaki's filled with cheese, my homie Sap is on the beat
Like it was ""Donald Trump, "" a fuckin' hit but I just call it luck
They throw it on when I'm walkin' in the club
Hey, this the 'Burgh shit, I don't deserve this
Well, I don't think you lookin' far beyond the surface
Learn quick, now I'm big time
Fill your cup up, and I'ma sip mine
Fill it up with dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Lookin' at the sky, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality

Juntos en la oscuridad
Fuimos queriendo, cada vez mas
Nada podia cambiar.
El paso del tiempo, nos quiso alejar
Y nuestro amor pudo más.
Y ahora estoy frente a ti, amándote
Mi corazón, no puede esconder
Que yo sin ti, no sé querer
Vuelvo a vivir, a tu lado el amor que soñé.
Sola en mi cuarto sin tu calor
Fui conociendo el temor
Te quise tanto mi alma te di
Hoy que regresas a mí.
Se llena el vacío, se apaga el dolor
Hoy tengo tu amor.
Y ahora estoy frente a ti, amándote
Mi corazón, no puede esconder
Que yo sin ti, no sé querer
Vuelvo a vivir, a tu lado el amor que soñé.

Scared to meet his eyes
Even when she hears his voice, she's swarmed with butterflies
It's impossible to get you off my mind
I think about 100 thoughts and you are 99
I've understood that you will never be mine, and that's fine... I'm just breaking inside

A girl who keeps her head down low, and never shows her eyes...
He's tried to talk to her but there's no easy way
'Cause everytime he raises his voice, she runs away
It's impossible to get you off my mind
I think about 100 thoughts and you are 99
I've understood that you will never be mine, and that's fine... I'm just breaking inside
And one day, maybe she'll stay
And start to head over his way
And one day, she'll look into his eyes, and instead of breaking, she'll call him mine...
One day he'll grab her by the waist
And force them to meet
Face to face
And one day, he'll look into her eyes
And say that ""You're my only light""
Oh it's impossible to get you off my mind
I think about 100 thoughts and you are 99
Maybe there's a chance that you will be mine

20,Fight The Feeling,Mac Miller,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/mac-miller/fight-the-feeling-chords-2313521,"Close your eyes...
Love a drug that everybody here just tryna get a taste of
You a waste of the space that you take up
Livin', this time around I'm not kiddin'
I had an intuition about these women
And suspicion got me lookin' at you different
How a man in my position can't start slippin' down these slopes
'Cause it's all just (downhill from there)
As a kid I didn't learn that, but (now I'm aware)
When you a youngin
You just tryna live your life and have some fun
In a world where you have yet to see how evil it's become
It's hard to have a dream when you deep inside of one
And I know you hate them spirits so I keep em in my lungs
I'm a Beatle to these young kids
But sometimes I be feelin' like a needle to these young kids
You had the world, you about to leave it to these young kids
And we gonna show you what the love is...
Stay high,   go for what you know
Let it in your mental and don't ever let it go
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no (it won't stop!)
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
Uh, and I keep a couple Most Dope homies by me
So there ain't too many times it's me, myself and Irene
We stay smokin' through the night wake up, do some tai-chi
Homie can't you see I'm chillin? Please don't fuck up my chi
Yeah my jacket Y-3, recently been up on fashion
Waste a bunch of money, kinda stinks of satisfaction
Fell asleep in Hollywood, woke up in Manhattan
Ballin' like I'm Jordan, but I'm fresh as Mars Blackmon
A penny for your thoughts, a dollar for your dreams
A price on an idea, we never can agree
They tell you what to know, but it's better to believe
So why you tryna act like what you never gonna be?
Still I tell em, ""Fuck what you know, I'm feelin' comfortable""
Just continue livin' life, cause enough of 'em don't
You spent your days countin' every single penny made
Restart now, cause we comin' for you anyways
Stay high,   go for what you know
Let it in your mental and don't ever let it go

You can't fight the feeling, no (it won't stop!)
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
Sometimes I wake up, up in the morning, make up
Wipe the smudge of makeup off my bed
Hours out my day just to find power shit to say
But you won't hear it
I mean the sun is slowly falling, we all surely should die eventually
Identity crises break mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness
Jesus Christ is right near us and Devil said you owe ten percent
Sold your soul, I know, sold your soul and you're hopeless
My focus, stare at elopin' on boats that float in the open
Of oceans that coast the line on the margins I rhyme, choking
Or soaking up game, I'm hoping you picked the second one
Change the emotion of jealousy that you're holding
You're telling me that you're golden but really cubic zirconia
Let me see, I'll break you down like a pound of fire, whenever
Your tactics are mighty clever but even if you Mayweather, you
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no (it won't stop!)
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no

I kept my eyes wide open
Every time she said she loved me
Nobody's clown, no I never joined that circus
I played it cool
I'm nobody's fool
Nobody's toy, I wasn't made to play with
Just love 'em and leave 'em
That's my game and I got to remain
Nobody's love
Nobody's bread and butter
Yeah, I played it cool
And I'm nobody's fool
When I wake up in the morning
Nobody's fool
Nobody's one and only
I guess that's why I'm so lonely
I'm nobody's fool
Ta ta ta ta
I made this bed that I sleep in
It's the one that I weep in
Oh Lord, I get so lonely

And it wouldn't be a bad thing
But I don't get no loving
And that's no lie.
We spent the night in Frisco
At every kind of disco
From that night I kissed
Our love goodbye.
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie.
Don't you blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good time
Blame it on the boogie.
That nasty boogie bugs me
But somehow it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm gets me
On my feet.
I've changed my life completely
I've seen the lightning leave me
My baby just can't take
Her eyes off me.
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie.
Don't you blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie.
I just can't
I just can't
I just can't control myself.
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie.
Don't you blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good time
Blame it on the boogie.
This magic music grooves me
That dirty rhythm moves me
The devil's gotten to me
Through this dance.
I'm full of funky fever
A fire burns inside me
Boogie's got me in a
Super trance
Sunshine   (Don't you blame it)
Moonlight  (You just got to)
Good times (You just want to)
Boogie     (Yeah) -
Sunshine   (Blame it on yourself)

Found me searching   for the     fire
The elusive sea of childhood
Then became a one desire
There were places in the valley
Where they said that I could find it
There were rhythms in the distance
In the ancient elder forest
That is why I came to   California
It's the strangest groove that I have ever known
All the youth seekers come to California
Following the fountain in their mind
San Francisco
Catch a cable car to where your dreams go
There's a lot of make believe
San Diego
From LA you'll find out where your dreams flow
From the hillside to the desert
Following the map inside me
I can the feel the road is leading
To the treasure that will guide me

I've been for a walk       on a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm       if I was in L.A.;
Oooohh, California dreamin'        on such a winter's day, yeah
I Stopped in to a church        that I passed along the way
Well I had to get down on my knees     and I pretend to pray
Don't you know the preacher keeps me cold     Cause he knows I'm gonna stay Yeahhh
Oooohh, California dreamin'        on such a winter's day, on such a winter's day
If I didn't tell her       that I could leave her today;
I'd still be that California dreamin'       on every winter's day
I'd still be    that California dreamin'   on searching for my mind,
searching for something that needs me here, on this California dreaming
    dream on,    dream on;
  Something's holding me here,     in L.A.
  Something's holding me here, in L.A.
I'd like to know   I'd like to know
And I still believe somthing good there that I've got to find
I'd    like to know   I'd     like to know
I'm still that California dreaming
Dream on    dream on
Dream  on    dream on
Dream on    oh, dream on
Dream on   dream on   dream on

Take these chains from my heart and set me free
You've grown cold and no longer care for me
All my faith in you is gone, but the heartaches linger on
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Take these tears from my eyes and let me see
Just a spark of the love that used to be
If you love somebody new, let me find a new love too
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
Give my heart just a word of sympathy
Be as fair to my heart as you can be
Then if you no longer care for the love that's beating there
Take these chains from my heart and set me free

I'm not trying to indicate my state of mind.
I turn you on,
I tell you that I'm laughing just to keep from crying
And bringing music when you hear it,
Keep on trying to get near it.
A little rhythm for your spirit
Oh but that's what it's for
Come on in, here's the door
And I've seen a sparrow get high
And waste his time in the sky
He thinks it's easy to fly
He's just a little bit freer than I
Now here's a mystery
And maybe you can help to make it clear to me
When you're fast asleep
Then what is it that's lighting up the dreams you see
Only your tears can't conceal it
And only your prayers may not reveal it
You've got soul so you can feel it
And when you make the scene
Well you know what I mean
Hey I've seen a sparrow get high
And waste his time in the sky
He thinks it's easy to fly
He's just a little bit freer than I

Down here on the ground
When you find folks are giving you the runaround
Keep your game uptight
And if you must just take your secrets underground
Now politicians are trying to speech you
Mad colour watchers are trying to teach you
Very few will really try to reach you
If you're lost in a stack
That's OK, come all black
Now I'd be the last to deny
That I'm just an average guy
And don't you know each little bird in the sky
Is just a little bit freer than I
Hey ordinary Joe
Although they say you're just a lazy so-and-so
What they think is real
Is nothing but an animated puppet show
So don't let time and space confuse you
And don't let name and form abuse you
Let that Big Joe Williams blues you
In the light of the sun you can see how they burn

He didn't play by any rules
But one thing he knew for sure

He'd best be payin' them some mind
There were a lot of changes coming

Jehovah sent a bright light shinin' down
Knocked Jimmy to the floor

The preacher when he was a man

Then rolls out to sea
And the sea is very still once more
So I rush to your side
With one burning thought
Will your arms open wide
At last we're face to face
And as we kiss through an embrace
I can tell, I can feel
You are love, your are real really
Mine in the rain
In the dark, in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb
I'm at peace in the web of your arms
I can tell oh how I can feel
You are love, your are real really
Mine in the rain
In the dark or in the sun
Like the tide at its ebb
I'm at peace in the web of your arms

Tho' the darkness hits me ever hard        I'll stand long

Lovers dreaming dreams each blessed by night
 I will find the promised paradise

Lord, Lordy, Lordy
Standing here on my own side
Waiting for the floor
Your world's moving fast
But still ends up a bore
Come on give me a little room now
Do you have to take it all
Yeah that's the way it is I guess
When you're born with nothing at all
I want to talk to you
I want to talk to you
Hey boy don't feel my world's untrue
Yeah, I wanna talk to you
My world can be true, if you do what I tell you to
I want to talk to you
Pick up my life at the table
Read about the way I could be
But I know I just ain't able
So I read about the real me
Who can I blame
For the way I am
I ain't never had one soul to help me
So I don't give a-----
I want to talk to you
I want to talk to you
Hey boy don't feel my world's untrue
Yeah, I wanna talk to you
My world can be true, but you gotta find out what to do
I want to talk to you
Gotta woman that love me
Feed me beans every night
Twelve babies look up at me
With big grey hungry eyes
Oh but I just can't complain
You see ya, said I ain't allowed
Oh but pretty soon will come a change
When I gain the biggest mouth
I want to talk to you
I want to talk to you
Hey boy don't feel my world's untrue, yeah boy
Yeah, I wanna talk to you
My world can be true, Imma show you what to do
I want to talk to you
Hey don't want to talk to you (What you mean by that boy)
I don't want to talk to you
I've been listening to you for 250 thousand years
Don't wanna talk to you
Too late, too late
I can't wait, don't wanna talk to you
Don't wanna talk to you
You can't tell me nothing white man
Ohhh I don't wanna say a word to you
No I don't hear ya, I don't wanna talk
Too late, Can't wait
Don't wanna talk to you
Don't need you for nothin'
Don't wanna talk to you
I'm gonna take my share
I don't wanna talk to you
Yeah, it's too late, can't wait
Don't care about your sake
I don't wanna talk to yoou

On an unpleasent ride
And your bridge of dreams comes
Tumblin' down
Don't let your bed of sorrow
Ever conquer your pride
Remember there's always a way out
Just take up a course in happiness
Take up a course to clear out your mind
You will show yourself how to smile
Take up a course in happiness
Take up a free instruction in life
You will learn how to smile

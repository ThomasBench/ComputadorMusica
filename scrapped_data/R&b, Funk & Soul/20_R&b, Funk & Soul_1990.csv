0,I Owe You One,Aaron Neville,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/aaron-neville/i-owe-you-one-chords-1934797,"There's a chill in the evening air
Carries me back to some place where
I thought I'd lost my way forever
Every dream and every plan
Every last chance slipped through my hand
And you smiled at me and it was over
Holding you tonight
Hold on tight
I try to say it ri-ght
And I guess sometimes the words don't come
And I wish I told you how you changed my life
And saved me with your love
I hope when all is said and done
You know I owe you one
Walk me down those streets again
Stop me right at the moment when
You stood there talking to a stranger
Tell me how you looked at me
And knew the very best that I could be
How did you see this happy ending
Standing by your side
I'm still surprised
I try to say it right
But I guess sometimes the words don't come
And I wish I'd told you how you changed my life
And saved me with your love
I hope when all is said and done
You know I owe you one
(One for life and one for love)
And all you've given me
For the dreams you made me dream again
And all that we can be
(Holding you tonight), holding you tonight
Hold on tight
I try to say it   ri-ght
I guess sometimes the words don't come
And I wish I'd told you how you changed my life
And saved me with your love
I hope when all is said and done
You know I owe you one

1,Some Days Are Made For Rain,Aaron Neville,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/aaron-neville/some-days-are-made-for-rain-chords-3135365,"We held each other 'til the moon was high
We waved that sleepy little town good bye
And driving off together we crossed our hearts
Living for the promise that love would keep us honest
I said I'd be yours if you'd be mine
We were crazy baby
And every day the sun was sure to shine
But it tried and tried
Sometimes the wind makes a sudden change
And some days are made for rain
We fixed a tire and we drove like hell
We kissed like fire in a cheap motel
I never felt the hunger so bad before
Holding you beside me - Walls came down inside me
And I thought I was yours and you were mine
That was crazy baby
I was sure the sun would always shine
But it tried and tried
Sometimes the wind makes a sudden change
And some days are made for rain
You want to talk about love
I'll tell you all about love
Nothing but trouble
On top of falling
One day you're walking on air
Next day you look and there's no one there
She never cared
...
(She never cared)
Now I've been sleeping with the TV on
I get so tired of wondering where you've gone
You tore across my heart across like a hurricane
I'm counting up the damage
Trying hard to manage
And I thought I was yours and you were mine
That was crazy baby
I was sure the sun would always shine
But take a look outside
Sometimes a wind makes a sudden change
Here comes those clouds and they're full of pain
Some days are made for rain
...
(Some days are made for rain)
Let it pour outside
Some days are made for rain
Some days are made for rain

I just walked away
guess I must be crazy
guess I must be mad

You missed her so bad
Picture of me lay here all alone
Waiting for your call on telephone
Wish that i could turn back the happy time
You know I can't believe that I was so blind, blind, blind...
Guess I must be crazy
Guess I must be mad
yes I miss you baby
funny when love is gone 
You missed her so bad, yes you do
        you adjusted me to do the things I miss
total confused   nothing makes sense to me
you must have been out of my mind

And while I slide down into darkness
You spent so proud, so proud in the light

Milky eyes like opal stones
Staring through a stained glass window
It's never too late to change your mind
Looking through a stained glass window
It's never too late
It's never too late
I know a man, couldn't change the peace
That stands between us
But these open hands are empty bowls to fill
Come for the one who pays the most
You don't get thanks for loyalty
And all your friends, they've gone and sold you down the river
Don't you know, they've got your phone book now
Once your life was a fiery feast
Now it's just a burning ember
It's never too late
We'll get it back together
It's never too late
Release me from this sorrow
Will you never learn, love knows no bounds
Beggar or a king, it will bring you down
Fool I may be, can't give up the ghost that haunts me

So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver take the keys to my truck
  Hit the shore 'cause I'm faded
Honeys in the street say, ""Monty, yo we made it!""
  It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kanai
All the gang-bangers forgot about the drive-by
  You gotta get your groove on,
before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because
(This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does
(This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor
(This is how we do it)
Let's flip up the track, bring the old school back
(This is how we do it)
This is how we do it,
all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wanna-be player
If you were from where I'm from then
   you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64
   Whatever it is,
the party's underway

Cintaku tercapai
Punyai kebebasan
Dan dikau berjaya telah berjaya
Sinaran... mentari menyinari
Menusuk ke jiwaku
Ketika bersamamu
Mesranya... bila kita berdua
Bagai mahligai indah
Yang tumbuh di muka dunia
Oh... peliknya rasa
Pabila... dikau tiada
Bagai kenangan yang tiba
menuju cahaya sedang menyinar...

    So you're having my baby
And it means so much to me
There's nothing more precious
Than to raise a family
    If there's any doubt in your mind
   You can count on me
   I'll never let you down
   Lady believe in me
    You and i
Will never fall apart
    You and i
We knew right from the start, baby, baby
    The day
We fell so far in love
Now our baby is born, healthy and strong
Now our dreams are reality
    Forever my lady
   It's like a dream
I'm holding you close
You're keeping me warm
If this is ecstacy
    Forever my lady
I say just what i mean
   Forever and ever
I pray is what i see
    Can you picture my lady      
   This empty scene
There's no me or no you

Baby I was born to give you all of my love
Baby I was born to give you all of my time
Just so we can be together
And share a love, to last forever baby (to last forever)
And the best thing you gave was sent to me
That we should spend some time apart
 Why did you go and do that
 Baby I just came to get
 If you don't want me, tell me
Girl if you don't really love me
Just let me know you would see
On the way it shouldn't be
Girl if you don't really love me
Just let me go let me be
So I can find someone to love me
Ba ba ba ba ba da~a, ba ba ba ba ba da~a
Ba ba ba ba ba da~a
Why did you do this to me?
What kind of man do you think that I am
To let you play with my heart
And what kind of fool do you take me for baby
I just won't step for it in me
Girl, if you don't really love me
Just let me know you would see
On the way it shouldn't be
Girl ,if you don't really love me
Just let me go, let me be
So I can find someone to love me
Girl,  tell me do you want me
I got to know right know
Tell me right now, girl
Girl,  I've been your fool
To long for you
And I've been waiting since, and I cant wait, no way
Girl, if you don't really love me
Just let me know you would see
On the way it shouldn't be
Girl ,if you don't really love me
Just let me go, let me be
So I can find someone to love me
Girl, if you don't really love me
Just let me know you would see
On the way it shouldn't be
Girl ,if you don't really love me
Just let me go, let me be
So I can find someone to love me, girl

0,When We Were Young (ver 7),Adele,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/adele/when-we-were-young-chords-2285417," Everybody loves the things you do
 From the way you talk to the way you move
 Everybody here is watching you
 Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
 But if by chance you're here alone
 Can I have a moment before I go
 Cause I've been by myself all night long
 Hoping you're someone I used to know
 You look like a movie
 You sound like a song
 My god this reminds me
 Of when we were young
 Let me photograph you in this light, in case it is the last time
 That we might be exactly like we were before we realized
 We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
 It was just like a movie, it was just like a song
 I was so scared to face my fears
 Cause nobody told me that you'd be here
 And I swore you moved overseas
 That's what you said when you left me
 You still look like a movie
 You still sound like a song
 My god this reminds me
 Of when we were young
 Let me photograph you in this light, in case it is the last time
 That we might be exactly like we were before we realized
 We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
 It was just like a movie, it was just like a song
 When we were young
 When we were young
 When we were young
 When we were young
 It's hard to admit that, everything just takes me back
 To when you were there
 To when you were there
 And a part of me keeps holding on just in case it hasn't gone
 I guess I still care
 Do you still care?
 It was just like a movie
 It was just like a song
 My god this reminds me
 Of when we were young
 When we were young
 When we were young
 When we were young
 When we were young
 Let me photograph you in this light, in case it is the last time
 That we might be exactly like we were before we realized
 We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
 Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes me reckless
 It was just like a movie, it was just like a song
 When we were young

1,Ivy (ver 2),Frank Ocean,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/frank-ocean/ivy-chords-1870310,"I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of nothing new
I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good
If I could see the walls, I could see you faking
If you could see my thoughts you would see your face is
Safe in my rental like an army truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
We drived to Syd's, had the X6 back then
Back then
No matter what I did
My waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then
We were friends
I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
The start of nothing
I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of nothing new
I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good
In the  halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you...meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more
We'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal
Don't you remember?
I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Scream my name
The feeling deep down is good
  I thought that I was dreaming
  When you said you loved me
  The start of nothing
  Had no chance to prepare
  Couldn't see you coming
  And we started from nothing
  I could hate you now
  It's alright to hate me now
  When we both know that deep down
  The feeling still deep down is good
All the things I didn't mean to say
I didn't mean to do
There were things you didn't need to say
Did you mean to, mean to
I could dream all night
Dream all night
I could drive all night
Drive all night
Dreaming, dreaming

As if we're all just how she imagined
Cause we're in love but just don't know it yet
Well, tell me how I'm supposed to see the magic
Cause I don't believe in it no more
But I won't tell her, 
Cause I always imagined
It's easier if she thinks she won
So Imma let her
And she said I don't think
I love you no more
You never seem to call me lately
Girl I don't think you know me at all
Cause I never thought I'd have to say this
No, I don't love you, and I never did
Look at us burning down in flames for kicks
But just know, I'm not singing for your XO
I'm just singing cause it's over
(Uh, Yeah)
Came and went like the summertime
Was that a sunset or sunrise
Looking back like where'd the time go
So much for trying to keep this moving slow
Cause I don't believe in her no more
But I remember,
How we talked shit like we knew what we wanted
And I still remember what she said
I don't think
I love you no more
You never seem to call me lately
Girl I don't think you know me at all
Cause I never thought I'd have to say this
But I'm no liar, and I never hid

   No you can't make everybody equal
   Although you got beaucoup family
   You don't even got nobody being honest with you
My whole body see through, 
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
   Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killing left and right
Working through your worst night
   I hope the sack is full up
   I'm fuckin', no I'm fucked up
  Spend it when I get that
Can't nobody reach you
Did you call me from a séance?
You are from my past life
Always like the head first
   Hope you're doing well bruh
   Everybody needs you
   Oooh nani nani
   This feel like a quaalude
No sleep in my body
New beginnings ahh
The sun's going down
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
The every night shit, every day shit
Dropping baby off at home before my night shift
Wanna see nirvana, but don't want to die, yeah
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by
Fuck with me after my shift
That's every day shit
Shut the fuck up I don’t want your conversation
Rolling marijuana that's a cheap vacation
Night shit, night shit, night shit
All my night, been ready for you all my night
Been waiting on you all my night
I'll buzz you in just let me know when you outside
  All my night
Still got some good nights memorized
And the look back's getting me right
Every night fucks every day up
       Every day patches the night up
On God you should match it, it's that KO
No white lighters til I fuck my 28th up
1998 my family had that Acura, oh
Kept at least six discs in the changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
Couple bishops in the city building mansions
All the reverends
Preaching self made millionaire status
When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion
After 'trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address
Fuckin on you when I didn't own a mattress
Working on a way to make it outta Texas
Every night
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift
        You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
Want to see nirvana, but don't want to die yeah
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down
See me bummed out, stressed out
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rolling marijuana, that's a cheap vacation

Toying somewhere between love and abuse
Calling to join them the wretched and joyful
Shaking the wings of their terrible youths
Freshly disowned in some frozen devotion
No more alone or myself could I be
Lurched like a stray to the arms that were open
No shortage of sordid, no protest from me
With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
Feeling more human and hooked on her flesh, I
Lay my heart down with the rest at her feet
Fresh from the fields, all fetor and fertile
It's bloody and raw, but I swear it is sweet

 You sound like a song

 'Cause nobody told me that you'd be here
 And I swore you moved overseas
 That's what you said, when you left me
 You still look like a movie
 You still sound like a song

 When we were young, when we were young
 It's hard to win me back
 Everything just takes me back to when
 You were there, to when you were there
 And a part of me keeps holding on
 Just in case it hasn't go, I guess
 I still care, do you still care?
 It was just like a movie
 It was just like a song

 Of when we were young...
 When we were young, when we were young
 When we were young, when we were young
 Let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
 That we might be exactly like we were before we realized
 We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
 Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes me reckless

   And kiss me slowly
It's the sweetest thing
   And it don't change
   If I had it my way
 You would know that you are
   You're the coffee that I need in the morning
   You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring
   Won't you give yourself to me
Give it all
I just wanna see
I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
   I know you're a star
Where you go I follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie
Oh, you're the best part, oh
You're the best part, oh
   It's the sunrise
   And those brown eyes, yes
You're the one that I desire
   When we wake up
   And then we make love
   It makes me feel so nice
   You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert
   You're the Tylenol I take when my head hurts
   You're the sunshine on my life
   I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie

47,What Do You Mean,Justin Bieber,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/justin-bieber/what-do-you-mean-chords-1763045,"What do you mean?         When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean?         When you don’t want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean?         What do you mean? Said we’re running out of time
What do you mean?         What do you mean? Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You're so indecisive of what I'm saying, trying to catch the beat make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complaining, don't want for us to end where do I start
First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day make love all night
First you up and you're down and then between
Ohh I really want to know
What do you mean?         When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean?         When you don’t want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean?         What do you mean? Said we’re running out of time
What do you mean?         What do you mean? Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You're overprotective when I'm leaving, trying to compromise but I can't win
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching, you had me from the start won't let this end
First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day make love all night
First you up and you're down and then between
Ohh I really want to know
What do you mean?         When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean?         When you don’t want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean?         What do you mean? Said we’re running out of time
What do you mean?         What do you mean? Better make up your mind

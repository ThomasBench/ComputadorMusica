Money breeds greed and greed is really bad
Money, money, oh, I never really had
And I got by just fine not workin' for the man
Thinkin' you got a dollar but you only got a dime
Hustle up your lovin' to see the sunshine
 The simple things and the simple things
Hide yourself
Try mould to perfection
When you don't feel like feeding the mouth
Bite the hand that feeds your wealth
And that ain't good for my mental health, oh, no
They only give a shit when you make it big
Frame my memory when I'm dead and gone
Turn their back when you make a hit
But if you love it then you'll hold it down
They only give a shit when you make it big
Frame my memory when I'm dead and gone
Turn their back when you make a hit
But if you love it then you'll hold it down
You gotta hold it down
Make a million dollars but it ain't that much
When it passes through the hands and they take their cuts
So put your face on the poster, got the people inside
When the debt rolls around, they go run and hide
 Eastside to the seaside
Southside to the middle and of course, I died
Head north to the border to get the time over
I surrender to the night (I surrender to the night)
I will kiss away my pride (I will kiss away my pride)
And I know it will find me one day
All in good time
They only give a shit when you make it big
Frame my memory when I'm dead and gone
Turn their back when you make a hit
But if you love it then you'll hold it down
They only give a shit when you make it big
Frame my memory when I'm dead and gone
Turn their back when you make a hit
But if you love it then you'll hold it down
You gotta hold it down

The dancer confronts her fear
'Bout her image and her worth
Or whether she's doomed or cursed
To be insecure for the rest of her days
And as she climbs up on a stage
She glances at the perverts who pay her wage
She says, ""Life is suffering, oh, yes, I know
But could you let me go?""
'Cause I'm the one you're gonna miss
I'm the one that you'll hold dear
About me, they'll reminisce

The writer confronts his fear
Has he done all he could
And will he be understood?
Or will his work be a dime-store luxury?
And as he sits at his desk
He starts to burn up all his texts
He says, ""Pain is pleasure, or so they say
But me, I gotta find my own way""
'Cause I'm the one you're gonna miss
I'm the one that you'll hold dear

And is this all a gift
Or is she missing all of it?
But if she sees her mom smile
Then it really drives her wild
'Cause her acceptance and approval was worth her while
When there's nowhere to run and hide
It's just me and you behind the mirror
She keeps screamin' inside

(Doing the best I can...)
(Doing the best I can...)
Something mutated when I was created
Because the two of you don't share one selfish cell
Lovin' and lustin', unthorough job rushin'
You never knew your boy was raised so well
Saturday AM you wake up, volunteer all over town
Saturday PM I rise up from my coffin in the ground
If actions speak louder, then I hardly make a sound
Stay above just enough so as not to drown
The most I could ever hope to do is follow the model set by you
I don't want to waste your time
The most I could ever hope to do is follow the model set by you
Make me want to be, make me want to be
Make me want to be an-

Doing the best I can
Honest man
Honest man
Doing the best I can
I don't care much for karma
Don't believe in the promised land!
What's it gonna take to make me an honest man?
Wondering how the hell I ever got a hold of you
We stayed high, maybe that's why you stayed so long?
Overtaken by complacency as boredom took on you
I stayed oblivious until you were already gone
Moving is hard,   but stagnation is harder
I can no longer be a burden, can't create no more martyrs
I need a light, cause I'm no self-starter
Hope I figure it out before I'm someone's father
The most I could ever hope to be is that to you which you were to me
To your life what you were to mine
The most I could ever hope to be is that to you which you were to me
The most I could ever hope to do is follow the model set by you
I don't want to waste your time
The most I could ever hope to do is follow the model set by you

Make me want to be an-

I can tell that you been drinkin'
You say nothing's different since the last fight
And he says he's gonna change, but nothin' ever changes
I can tell you things are gonna get better
Just so I can take your pain away
And tell you, ""Baby, keep your head up""
What I'm really dyin' to say is
""If he won't, I will""
Yeah, what I wanna say is
""It's his loss""
If he can't see it still
I knew it from the very first time I saw you
But you should be loved
So if he won't, I will
All the lies and the excuses
Yeah, you're scared to chеck his phone
'Cause you already know that it is usеless
And he's gonna blame it all on you
I can tell you in time you can make this work
Just to get out, even though it may hurt
That somehow we'll be everything you've been searchin' for
But what I'm really dyin' to say is
""If he won't, I will""
What I wanna say is
""It's his loss""
If he can't see it still
I knew it from the very first time I saw you
But you should be loved
So if he won't, I will
Oh, oh-oh-oh
You should be loved
Not in the way that he does
Oh, oh-oh-oh
You should be loved, ooh
But not in the way that he does
Yeah, what I wanna say is
""If he won't, I will""
It's what I wanna say, yeah

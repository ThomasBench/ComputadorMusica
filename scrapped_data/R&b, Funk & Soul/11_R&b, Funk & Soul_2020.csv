Asuntos peligrosos del pasado me persiguen todavía
Historias que la gente no olvidó y que me recuerdan cada día
Sigue, que vivo aquí, no me va a matar una vieja herida
Déjales que hablen mal, se mueran de envidia
Yo era ateo, pero ahora creo
Porque un milagro como tú ha tenido que bajar del cielo
Yo era ateo, pero ahora creo
Porque un milagro como tú ha tenido que bajar del cielo
Yo era ateo, pero ahora creo
Porque un milagro bajó del cielo
Yo era ateo
Pero ahora creo
Hablan de mi vida como si hubieran pasa'o todos por ella, eh-eh-eh
Y mientras cuentan cuentos, tú y yo solos, bachatas y una botella
Quiero hacerle religión a tu melena, a tu boca y a tu cara
Y que me perdone la Vírgen de la Almudena
Las cosas que hago en tu cama
Sigue, que vivo aquí, no me va a matar una vieja herida
Déjales que hablen mal, se mueran de envidia (Que hablen)
Yo era ateo, pero ahora creo
Porque un milagro como tú ha tenido que bajar del cielo
Yo era ateo, pero ahora creo
Porque un milagro como tú ha tenido que bajar del cielo
Yo era ateo, pero ahora creo
Porque un milagro bajó del cielo
Yo era ateo
Pero ahora creo
Me sacaste de la oscuridad
Somos un asunto 'e gravedad
Tú despierta' ese diablo mío que me roba toda espiritualidad
Ya no sé lo que me pasa
Ahora nada te reemplaza
Tu boca es como mi casa
Lo que yo di se parece veneno
  Si me preguntan, yo le' diré que no lo sé
Quiero gritar que te echo de menos
Dame del agua bendita que calma mi sed (El último romántico)
Yo era ateo (Eso es), pero ahora creo
Porque un milagro como tú ha tenido que bajar del cielo
Yo era ateo, pero ahora creo
Porque un milagro como tú ha tenido que bajar del cielo

World is sleeping, I'm awake with you, with you
Watch movies that we've both already seen
I ain't even looking at the screen, it's true
I got my eyes on you
And you say that you're not worth it
You get hung up on your flaws
Well, in my eyes, you are perfect as you are
    I won't ever try to change you, change you
    I will always want the same you, same you
    Swear on everything I pray to
That I  won't break your heart
   I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely
   Keep the secrets that you told me, told me
   And your love is all you owe me
And I  won't break your heart
On Sunday mornings we sleep in 'til noon
Oh, I could sleep wherever next to you, next to you
And we, we got places we both gotta be
But there ain't nothing I would rather do
Than blow off all my plans for you
And you say that you're not worth it
You get hung up on your flaws
Well, in my eyes, you are perfect as you are, as you are

And your days, they seem so hard

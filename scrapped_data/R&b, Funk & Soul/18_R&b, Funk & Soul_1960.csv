	Hold him and kiss him and squeeze him and love him
	Yeah, just do it and after you do, you will be his
	You will be his

There's only 24 hours
in a day
But that don't leave much time to play, I don't dig that no way, honey
'Cause my heart can't take it, no,
another day
Listen to me, honey
I've been told by many different girls
""Otis, I love you"" Oh boy, they tell me this
From the bottom of their soul, but they didn't mean it, listen
I, I've been let down, hit the ground
And called the biggest, the biggest fool
The biggest fool to ever walk on this ground, listen
I can't stand it, no no no no
To be built up, way on up, and
let down
Being in love, y'all, is all in my mind
I don't like that, I like for it to be from my heart and I found out later
I was wasting my time
Just a waste of time, yeah
Somebody understand what I'm saying when I say
It's just a waste of time
If you don't want me, mama, don't just leave me hangin'
Don't just let me waste my time, no, no
Somebody, somebody got to get the message to me

  While   the one that loved me

  I was a fool
  Playing the fields and running around heavy, foreign, man
  I know everybody   make a mistake sometimes
  But when I got home, oh
  My baby, she was gone
      And I found a letter, now
  Right there on the kitchen floor,    it read:
  ""I tried to wait
  For you to come, honey
  But, like a fool you were running around, doing me wrong""

A candle glows
I believe for everyone who goes astray
Some one will come to show me the way

I believe above the storm the smallest prayer
Can still be heard
I believe that someone in the great somewhere
Hears every word
Every time I hear a new born baby cry
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know I, I, I believe
Every time I hear a new born baby cry
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know I, I, I believe

You know that I love you dear with all my heart
I know that you didn't love me from the start

Had turned down his advances and played hard to get
He would never let this bother him, this I know
Because where there's light there's hope, baby
Don't go away, no no
Don't you hear now, don't you hear now,

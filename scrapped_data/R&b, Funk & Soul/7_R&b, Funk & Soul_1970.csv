0,Hes Misstra Know It All (ver 2),Stevie Wonder,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/stevie-wonder/hes-misstra-know-it-all-chords-3869378,"He's a man
With a plan
Got a counterfeit dollar in his hand
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Playing hard
Talking fast
Making sure that he won't be the last
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Makes a deal
With a smile
Knowing all the time that his lie's a mile
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Must be seen
There's no doubt
He's the coolest one with the biggest mouth
He's Misstra Know-It-All
When you tell him he's living fast
He will say what do you know
If you had my kind of cash
You'd have more than one place to go,
oh, ooh...
Any place
He will play
His only concern is how much you'll pay
He's Misstra Know-It-All
If he shakes
On a bet
He's the kind of dude that won't pay his debt
Oh, He's Misstra Know-It-All
When you say that he's living wrong
He'll tell you he knows he's living right
And you'd be a stronger man
If you took Misstra Know-It-All's advice,
oh oh, ooh, mmm-mmm
He's the man
With a plan
Got a counterfeit dollar in his hand
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Take my word
Please beware
Of a man that just don't give a care, no
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Dum bum bum ba bum bum

If we had less of him
Don't you know we'd have a better land
He's Misstra Know-It-All
So give a hand to the man
Although you've given out as much as you can
He's Misstra Know-It-All
Check his sound out now
He'll tell it all
Hey, you talk too much, you worry me to death, hey
He's Misstra Know-It-All
He's some kind of fella
Thinking of only himself
He's Misstra Know-It-All

That you know has got a super plan
He's Misstra Know-It-All

You can lay around the rack with your old lady all day Monday

I don't care what in the world you do As long as you do what you say you going to
Ain't nobody's business but your own
Now, I know Some of you cuties, you really good looking cuties, You go
stepping downtown just to hang around, Standing on the corner so the fellows will say
You can walk downtown in your birthday suit, 
I can catch you coming out of the bank with a whole lotta loot
Ain't nobody's business but your own
cocaine's for horses now it ain't for men, 
The doctor said it 'll kill me, but he didn't say when
Ain't nobody's business but my own
Now, you know sometimes I put on my straw hat,
And I go trucking downtown, just to hang around.
Standing on the corner so the fellas can stare and say
Hey man, ain't you the brother in the '57 mercury
Now, champagne don't drive me crazy, Cocaine don't make me lazy
Ain't nobody's business but my own

And he tells you that he needs you
And he covers you with flowers
And he always keeps you dreamin
If he always keeps you dreamin
You won’t have a lonely hour
If a day could last forever
You might like your ivory tower
But the night begins to turn your head around
And you know you’re gonna lose more than you’ve found
Yes, the night begins to turn your head around
Beware, of his promise
Believe, what I say
Before, I go forever
Be sure, of what you say

If you don’t believe I’m leaving
And goodbye may come too quickly
If you really think he loves you
If you really think he loves you
You would give your love so sweetly
if the day could last forever
You would fall in love completely

as the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
the waiter brought a tray
And so it was  that later
as the miller told his tale
that her face, at first just ghostly,         
turned a whiter  shade of pale
She said, There is no reason
and the truth is plain to see.
But I wandered through my playing cards
and would not let her be
one of sixteen vestal virgins
who were leaving for the coast
and although my eyes were open
they might have just as well been closed

I'm not trying to indicate my state of mind. 
I turn you on, 
I tell you that I'm laughing just to keep from crying 
Pretty music when you hear it, 
Keep on trying to get near it.
A little rhythm for your spirit 
Oh but that's what it's for 
Come on in, here's the door
And I've seen a sparrow get high 
And waste his time in the sky 
He thinks it's easy to fly 
He's just a little bit freer than I
Now here's a mystery 
And maybe you can help to make it clear to me 
When you're fast asleep 
Then what is it that's lighting up the dreams you see 
Only your tears can't conceal it 
And only your prayers may not reveal it 
You've got soul so you can feel it 
And when you make the scene 
Well you know what I mean 
Hey, I've seen a sparrow get high 
And waste his time in the sky 
He thinks it's easy to fly 
He's just a little bit freer than I
Down here on the ground 
When you find folks are giving you the runaround 
Keep your game uptight 
And if you must just take your secrets underground 
Now politicians are trying to speech you 
Mad colour watchers are trying to teach you
Very few will really try to reach you 
If you're lost in a stack 
That's OK, come all black
Now I'd be the last to deny 
That I'm just an average guy 
And don't you know each little bird in the sky 
Is just a little bit freer than I
Hey ordinary Joe 
Although they say you're just a lazy so-and-so 
What they think is real 
Is nothing but an animated puppet show
So don't let time and space confuse you 
And don't let name and form abuse you 
Let that Big Joe Williams blues you 
In the light of the sun you can see how they burn

I recall, when I left a little town in North Carolina,
I tried to escape this music.
I said it was for the old country folks.
I went to New York, got slick, got my hair made (heh-heh- heh-heh),
I was cool. I was cool.
But I had no groove, no groove.
I had no groove.
But now, fly on baby…Dig…Can you feel that baby?
It’s called Funkadelic music.

 Though they do pre-tend; they won't go when I go.
 All those bleeding hearts, with sorrows to im-part;
Were right here from the start, and they won't go when I go.
And I'll go, where I've longed, to go, so  long, a  -way, from tears.
 Gone from painful cries, a-way from saddened eyes,
A-long with him I'll bide, because they won't go when I go.
 Big men feeling small, weak ones standing tall;
 I will watch them fall; they won't go when I go.
And I'll go, where I've longed, to go, so  long, a  -way, from tears.
 Unclean minds mislead the pure, the innocent will leave for sure;
 For them there is a resting place.
 People sinning just for fun, they will never see the sun,
 For they can never show their faces.
There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner,
Who will take more than he will give,
He'll give, he'll give, he ain't hardly gonna give, oh yeah.
The greed of man will be,   far away from me,
And my soul will be free; they won't go when I go.
 Since my soul con-ceived, all that I be-lieve,
The kingdom I will see; 'cos they won't go when I... go.
When I  go, where I'll go, no one, can keep,
 Me from; my... desti...ny.

Love became an ageless soul
Nature reached her highest goal
 And breathed the breath of life

 Daylight came from in the night
 And all was good
Life became a Masterplan
Love produced the perfect man
 That's understood
The image of the makers word
Worshipped him with all he had
But then one day
From in the depths an evil seed
Grew and manufactured greed
 That changed the way of life
 Everlasting life
Oh the loving power looked and saw
Inside the heart of man a flaw
 Began to grow
Well, the fires of hell began to burn
And so he sent his chosen son
 To let us know
That love had surely made us all
And hate would surely make us fall
So from the cross
Well he showed the world that dreadful day

Is there somethin' here you might have overlooked?
'Cause it would be a shame if you would leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be
The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad
And now you say that you've grown tired
You want to be by yourself a while
But it would be a shame if you would go
And find that freedom was a long time ago
I know that you can't stand the chains to bind you
But they just keep on drivin' us apart
And you could go where I would never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from your heart?
So, one more time, for ol' times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest
Please don't throw this moment away
We can forget the bad and take the best
But if you don't have nothing else to say
Let me hold you one more time for ol' times sake

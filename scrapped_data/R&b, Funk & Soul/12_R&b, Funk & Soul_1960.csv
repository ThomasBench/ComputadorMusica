You can’t hurry love
No, you just have to wait you ‘gotta trust give it time
It's a game of give and take
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait
She said, trust, give it time, no matter how long it takes
Now break!
No, love  love don't come easy
But I keep on waiting, anticipating
For that soft voice to talk to me at night
For some tender arms  to hold me tight,
I keep waiting,  I keep on waiting
But it ain't easy,   it ain't easy, but Mama said
You can't hurry love, no, you just have to wait
She said, trust, give it time, no matter how long it takes
You can't hurry love, no,
You just have to wait.  .   .   .  .

It's only there trying to fool the public.
But when it comes down to fooling you,
Now, honey that's quite a different subject.
Don't let my glad expression,
Give you the wrong impression.
really I'm sad.......Oh, I'm sadder than sad.
You're gone and I'm hurting so bad,
Like a clown I appear to be glad.. 
Now, they're some sad things known to man,
but ain't too much sadder than,
the tears of a clown, when there's no one around. 
Now, if I appear just like Pagliacci did,
I try to keep my sadness hid.
Smiling in the public eye, but in my
lonely room I cry, the tears of a clown,
when there's no one around.

       Really 
      Couldn't get away too          soon 
     I can't imagine any -     hing that's better 
     The world is ours when - ever      we're together 
There       ain't a place I'd       like to be in -     stead       of
       Groovin' 
      Down a crowded         avenue 
       Doin' 
Any -         thing we like to         do 
     There's always lots of things that      we can see 
     We can be anyone we      like to be 
     And all those happy people      we could     meet     just
       Groovin' 
      On a Sunday after -          noon 
       Really 
      Couldn't get away too         soon. No no     no no 
       Ah-ha-       haaa             3x  
     We'll keep on spending sunny      days this way 
     We're gonna talk and laugh our      time away 
     I feel it comin' closer      day by day 
   Life would be ec -       stasy,      you and me      endlessly
       Groovin' 
      on a Sunday after -         noon 
       Really 
      couldn't get away too        soon No no     no no 
       Groovin'. A -      haa a -         haa ha

0,You Dont Have To Say You Love Me,Dusty Springfield,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/dusty-springfield/you-dont-have-to-say-you-love-me-chords-2171,"When I said I needed you,   you said you would always stay
It wasn-t me who changed but you, and now you-ve gone away
Don-t you see? But now you-ve gone,  and I-m left here on my own
That I have to follow you, and beg you to come home
You don-t have to say you love me, just be close to hand
You don-t have to stay forever, I will understand
Believe me, believe me, I can-t help but love you
But believe me, I-d never tie you down
Left alone with just  a memory,    life seems dead and so unreal
All that-s left is loneliness, there-s nothing left to feel
You don-t have to say you love me, just be close to hand
You don-t have to stay forever, I will understand
Believe me, believe me
You don-t have to say you love me, just be close to hand
You don-t have to stay forever, I will understand
Believe me,   believe me,   believe me

Falling in love with you?

Surely to the sea
Darling so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my  hand
Take my whole life too

Take my  hand
Take my whole life too

Falling in love with you

If you go a - way ...on this summer day,
Then you might as well take the sun away,
All the birds that flew ...in the summer sky,
When our love was new, and our hearts were high,
When the day was young, and the night was long,
And the moon stood still ...for the nightbird's song,
If you go away, if you go away, ...if you go away
But, ...if you stay, I'll make you a day...
Like no day has been, or will be a - gain,
We'll sail on the sun, we'll ride on the rain,
We'll talk to the trees, and worship the wind,
Then, if you go, I'll under - stand,
Leave me just enough love to hold in my hand,
If you go a - way, if you go a - way,
If you go a - way
Ne me quitte pas, il faut oublier,
Tout peut s'oblier, qui s'enfuit déjà,
Oubli - er le temps ...des malentendus,
Et le temp perdu, a savoir comment,
Oubli - er   ces heures ...qui tuai - ent parfois,
A coups de pourquoi ...le couer du Bonheur,
Ne me quitte pas, ne me quitte pas,
Ne me quitte pas
But, ...if you stay, I'll make you a night,
Like no night has been, or will be a - gain,
I'll sail on your smile, I'll ride on your touch,

Then, if you go, I'll under - stand,
Leave me just enough love to hold in my hand,
If you go a - way, if you go a - way,
If you  go a - way
If you go away, as I know you must,
There'll be nothing left in this world to trust,
Just an empty room, full of empty space,
Like the empty look ...I see on your face,
      Oh, I'd have been the shadow of your shadow,
      If it might have kept me by   your side,
...If you go   away, if you go away, if you go a - way

Over time, I've been building my castle of love
Just for two, though you never knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you now to say
That I've got to throw my castle away
And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me
Overjoyed, over loved, over me
And though the odds say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you will find
You too like I
Overjoyed, over loved, over you

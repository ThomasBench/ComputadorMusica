And you've got nobody, the lonely hours over here
Sittin' home and thinkin', you say:
Distant lover (lover, lover, lover)
Ooh, So many miles away
Oh, how I long for you
Every night, and sometimes I yearn through the day
Distant lover (lover lover lover)
You should think about me, Say a prayer for me
Please, oh please baby, think about me sometime
Think about me, yeah, in misery
Oh, say it baby
As I reminisce our joyful summer together
The promises we made of a daily letter
Then all of a sudden everything seemed to explode
Now I gaze out my window down that lonesome road
Distant lover (lover, lover, lover)
How can you treat my heart so mean and cruel?
Didn't you know, sugar, that every moment
That I spend with you I treasure it like it was (a) precious jewel
Oh baby (Lord, have mercy) 
Something I wanna say: When your love took all of me with you
Never, woman, do you want to hear me scream
""Please, please, oh please"" Come back home
Oh, baby, please darlin'
Come back home

I saw my grandma sweeping
With her old straw broom

She could hardly understand
That she was really sweeping up..
Pieces of a man
I saw my daddy greet the mailman
And I heard the mailman say
""Now don't you take this letter to hard now Jimmy
Cause they've laid off nine others today""
He didn't know what he was         saying

Come knifing through the gloom

Let me be me
I wanna get far from here
Or should I up and fly away so fancy free, yeah
Nobody can change my mind
The words of destiny are calling me wild time
I want destiny
It's the place for me
Ah, destiny
You and me
Should we fly away
Ah, destiny
So fancy free
Ah, destiny

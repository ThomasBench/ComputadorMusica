A cold sweat hot-headed believer
I threw my hand in the air and said show me something
He said if you dare come a little closer
Round and around and around and around we go
Ohhhh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like i cant live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stayyyyy
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, is giving
Round and around and around and around we go
Ohhhhh now tell me now tell me now tell me now you know
Not really sure how i feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like i cant live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stayyyyyyyyyy
Ooooohhhh the reason I hold on
Ooooohhhh cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But im the only one who needed saving
Cause when you never seen the light  
It's hard to know which one of us is caving
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I cant live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stayyyyyyyyyy   
Stayyyyyyyyyyy
I want you to stay
Ohhhhhh

1,Ghost,Ella Henderson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ella-henderson/ghost-chords-1479184," I keep going to the river to pray
 'Cause I need something that can wash all the pain
 And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
 But your ghost, the ghost of you it keeps me awake
 My friends had you figured out
 Trying to hide in another you
 But your evil was coming through
 These guys sitting on the wall
 Bright light living in the shade
 You go hard makes the spirit shake
 I had to go through hell to prove
 I'm not insane
 Had to meet the devil just to know his name
 And that's where my love was burning
 I keep going to the river to pray
 'Cause I need something that can wash all the pain
 And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
 But your ghost, the ghost of you it keeps me awake
 I keep going to the river to pray
 'Cause I need something that can wash all the pain
 And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
 But your ghost, the ghost of you it keeps me awake
Each time that I think you go
And I let you under my skin
'Cause I love living in a sin
Boy you never told me
True pain that I don't deserve
Truth is that I never learn
 I keep going to the river to pray
 'Cause I need something that can wash all the pain
 And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
 But your ghost, the ghost of you it keeps me awake
 I keep going to the river to pray
 'Cause I need something that can wash all the pain
 And at most, I'm sleeping all these demons away
 But your ghost, the ghost of you it keeps me awake
 Give up the ghost
 Give up the ghost
 Give up the ghost
 Stop the haunting baby
 Give up the ghost
 Give up the ghost
 Give up the ghost 
 No more haunting baby

Searchin' for pieces, covering up the hole
I'll fight for your love, I'll fight for your soul
I'll throw all of my cares away for you
I'll be there to wait for you
Maybe you weren't the one for me
But deep down I wanted you to be
I'll still see you in my dreams
All the things that I did for you, just wasn't it for you
So I'll be coasting, roller-coasting
Through my emotion
I will be coasting, roller-coasting
I'm hoping that you'll come back to me
Moving on seems harder to do
When the one that you love moves faster than you
I gave you my all, I showed the proof of your lies
And you weren't worth it, you don't deserve me
As time passes I'm feeling high
You're not the one I'm thinking of tonight
I may not be over you, but I'll try inside
I'm feeling better now, finally feeling special now, oh
Coasting, roller-coasting
In my emotions, oh

From a place the world forgot

To bury my love

In the space
Colder than
The darkest sea
I have dreams
About the days
Driving through
Your sunset breeze
And the first thing
That I will do
Is bury my love for you
The brightness of the sun
Will give me just enough

Men reap what they sow
And I say what I know
To be true

Maybe it was me who brought you here
I should run the other way, but I stay right here

Drawing the lines from where I am, and from where I wanna be

   And he's funny like you sometimes
   And I found someone I really like
Maybe for the first time
No, I don't need a jacket
It's not that cold tonight
   And you worry, I get it
But he's waitin' outside
I swear on my heart that he's a good man
I know you'll stay up late just waitin' for me
You held me so tight, now someone else can
But you were the first man that really loved me
  Now you're driving to the airport
  Not just me you pick up anymore
  I've got eight days off comin' up
  And I can only come home for four
Yeah, I just met his family
They're just like you and mom (Oh)
He makes me really happy
I think he might be the one, oh
I swear on my heart that he's a good man
I promise he loves me, he'd never hurt me
You held me so tight, now someone else can
But you were the first man that really loved me
Now you're on the driveway, faking a smile
You wish you could tell him he doesn't deserve me
So I had to stop the car and turn around
To tell you you were the first man that really loved me
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah
And before they open up the doors
I say, ""I've never seen you cry before""
You say, ""You've never looked so beautiful
You know you'll always be my little girl""
You're looking at me while walking down the aisle
With tears in your eyes, maybe he deserves me
You don't even know how much it means to me now

Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Make me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone, got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
""My God, you pay for your friends?"" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we're Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
Beans they took from the cabinet (Whoa)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future

I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So, therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it, so insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame, we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine, or leave it like Cobain
  And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go, Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk, at least I think so, can't tell
  'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care, it's kinda sad but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins, I'm stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping, I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special, and if I lose my mental
  Just hold my hand, even if you don't understand, hol' up

 Type of girl you wanna take home to mama
Wanna be the type of girl my daddy, he'd be proud of
 The type of girl you wanna take home right up to mama
The kind of girl, I know your fellas, they'd be proud of
 Normal girl, oh (No fantasy, no fantasy)
I really wish a was a normal girl, oh my
 Normal girl, oh
I wish I was a normal girl, oh babe
This time next year I'll be livin' so good
Won't remember your name, I swear
This time next year I'll be livin' so good
Won't remember no pain, I swear
Before that you figured out, that I was just a normal girl
We own the world, 'cause it ain't going away now

Can't keep your eyes off my fatty

Drunk in love
We be all night, love,      love
We be all night, love,      love

And everything alright
No complaints for my body, so fluorescent under these lights

I'm rubbing on it, rub-rubbing, if you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right
Armand de brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out like washed rags he wet up
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm singing on the mic 'til my voice hoarse
Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body
Been serving all this, swerve, surfing all in this good, good

Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve
Foreplay in the foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take draws off, on site

We were walking on moonlight
When you held me close
Split second and you disappeared
And then I was all alone
I woke up in tears with you by my side
Breathe of relief and I realized
No, we're not promised tomorrow
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you, like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing, I won't take you for granted
Cause we'll never know when...When we'll run out of time

And I'll make the most of the minutes
And love with no regret

Use what we got before it's all gone

Bought a wedding ring, it's in my pocket
Planned to ask the other day
Knew you'd run away, so I guess I just forgot it

 Hours on the phone, we end up talkin'
Past, present, future, all the gossip,    God damn
Puppy love ain't what it was, darlin'
Feelings that we have are so alarmin'
I can make you laugh, I can break the glass
If we made it last, it'd be a bargain
 Mr. Charmin', that is my department

  You was there when I was just a starvin' artist
When the car was havin' trouble startin'
Now we got our own apartment, same box for the mail
Same hamper for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale
And this mornin' you cooked the eggs with the kale
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed
You said ""All you ever think about is sex""
'm like, ""Oh well, you know me so well
And if this will make you late, I swear, I won't tell
And every time I call your phone, you better pick up your cell
I swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail""

But I swear that ass what Heaven's like

     Cause I'm waitin'    right  here for you, for you

 Your loveliness bring me sunshine

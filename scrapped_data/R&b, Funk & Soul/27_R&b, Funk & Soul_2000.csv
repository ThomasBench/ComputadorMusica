0,You Had Me,Joss Stone,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/joss-stone/you-had-me-chords-682516,"You had me
I don't want you here messing with my mind
Spitting in my eyes and I still see
Tried to keep me down, I'm breaking free
I don't want no part in your next fix
Someone needs to tell you this is it
Hey   listen you'll be missin' 
Out on all my love and my kissing
Make your mistakes on your own time 
When you come down you're just no good to have around
Instead of making money you took mine
You're wasted
You cost me
I don't want you here messing with my mind
I've realized in time 
I'm taking back my life
You're wasted
You cost me
I don't want you here messing with my mind
I've realized in time 
I'm taking back my life
Vodka and a packet of cigarettes
That's all it used to be but now
You're sniffing on snow when you're feeling low
Suffocating dreams that could have been
Maybe for a minute I was down with that
But it didn't take long for me to see the light
You swore you had control of it 
But when I stepped back you slipped on your supply
You had me
You're wasted
You cost me
I don't want you here messing with my mind
I've realized in time 
I'm taking back my life
Taking it back I'm taking it back
Taking back my life
Taking it back I'm taking it back
Taking back my life
Ain't nobody got no business stressing all the time
Taking back my life
You had me
You're wasted
You cost me
I don't want you here messing with my mind
I've realized in time 
I'm taking back my life
Taking it back I'm taking it back
Taking back my life
Taking it back I'm taking it back
Taking back my life
Ain't nobody got no business stressing all the time
Taking back my life

And you were only human after all
So don't hold back the tears my dear
Release them so your eyes can clear
I know that you will rise again
But you gotta let them fall
I wish that I could snap my fingers
Erase the past but no
You cannot rewind reality
Once the tape's unrolled
If your spirit's broken and you can't bear the pain
I will help you put the pieces back
A little more each day
And if your heart is locked and you can't find the key
Lay your head upon my shoulder
I'll set you free
I'll be your security
On any clock upon the wall 
The time is always now
So baby kiss the past goodbye
Don't let the future blow your mind
Just sit back and chill
Take things as they come
You can't be afraid
To live for today
I will be with you each step of the way

Tra la noia e la magia di una giornata uggiosa
E una camminata solo nella notte
Passando per le difficoltà di chi sorride e piange
Sono quelli come te che sfiorano il divino

E sogni di sentirti anche tu normale
Tra i semafori e lo smog di una giornata grigia
E la colazione al bar distratto e solo

Sui binari del metrò di angeli di città

Lasciali parlare?

I introduced myself
And she said her name was sky.

That her plainness was well seamless
And somewhere deep inside
She drove a calm and weightless determination
And to what lands her mind would travel
I don't know but I was so curious
I had to keep on thinking of her floating through the clouds Yeah
I asked her whether she enjoyed being in the air
And airily she answered with an accent so careful
I could feel each syllable while
I love things that seem impossible
I love things that seem impossible
Well I love things that seem impossible
And I love things that seem impossible Yeah

I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding, I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding, keep, keep bleeding love

Wherever it is, I'll fly
Whatever it takes, I'll try
So don't pay no mind
To what other people say
Whenever it is in my life
Know that I will be on time
'Cause you know why
There's no standing in our way

49,Homeless,Leona Lewis,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/leona-lewis/homeless-chords-667617,"   Waiting here for you to call me
For you to tell me   that everything`s a big mistake
   Waiting here in this rainfall
Feeling so small    this dream was not supposed to break
     I`m so sorry now
For the pain I`ve caused you
Won`t u please forgive     please
     But you don`t love me anymore
    You don`t want me anymore
    There's a sign on your do---o----or         no vacancy
  just emptiness     without your love
I`m homeless
   In this cold I`m walking aimless
Feeling helpless    without a shelter from the storm
   And in my heart I miss you so much
I`m missing your touch    and the bed used to be so warm
     I`m so sorry now
For the pain I`ve caused you
Won`t u please forgive     please
     But you don`t love me anymore
    You don`t want me anymore
    There's a sign on your do---o----or         no vacancy
 just emptiness without your love
      oh   my baby I`m sorry  sorry
     that you don`t love me anymore
    that You don`t want me anymore
    There's a sign on your do---o----or         no vacancy
 just emptiness     without your love
I`m homeless

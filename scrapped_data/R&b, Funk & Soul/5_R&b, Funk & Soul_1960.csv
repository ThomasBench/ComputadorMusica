I don't know if it's cloudy or bright.
Cause I only have eyes for you, dear.
The moon may be high..
But I can't see a thing in the sky.
For I only have eyes for you.
I don't know if, we're in a garden,
or on a crowded aven..ue...darling you..
..You are here, and so am I,
maybe millions of people go by,
but they all disappear from view.
An....d I only have eye..s for you.

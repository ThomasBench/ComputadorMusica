0,Its Four In The Morning,Tom Jones,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tom-jones/its-four-in-the-morning-chords-3710912,"It's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me
How much better off she would be
The longer I hold on, the longer this goes on
The harder that it's going to be
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me
I'd never desert her, God knows when I hurt her
That's the last thing that I want to do
But I know, too well, just what she's going through
If I love her so much, I don't know why I can't do
The right thing and just let her be
But it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me
Last night I told her, ""This time it's all over""
Making two times I've told her goodbye
And for the fifth time, I'm changing my mind
I saw more love in her eyes when I left her
Than most foolish men will ever see
An' it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me
It's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me
How much better of she would be
The longer I hold on and the longer there's no-one
The harder that it's gonna be
An' it's four in the morning and once more the dawning
Just woke up the wanting in me

Love burned a hole in the night
You're dancing eyes love light
Love burned a hole in the night
And it looks like another world
When I walk it with you
And we're flying above my wildest dreams
When there is no time and words will do
One look at you and they'll understand
One look should set things right
Love burned a hole in the night
That's why I'm crying right
Love makes crying alright
Oh my heart's first light

No matter what it takes we gotta try
Together we can work it out
We've come too far to ever turn back now
The road's been run every hill was high
We both took turns in making each other cry
But after all the ups and downs
We've been through
There's still enough of us
To hold on to
It's sad to see a good love die
There's just no good in saying goodbye
We may never love this way again
So before we're finally through
Let's hold on to me and you
While there's still enough of us
To hold on to
We said some things we never meant to say
We stepped on one another along the way
We could have called it quits
A time or two
There's still enough of us
To hold on to
It's sad to see a good love die
There's just no good in saying goodbye
We may never love this way again
So before we're finally through
Let's hold on to me and you

Only you
I've been in love before
I didn't think I could love anymore

In your heart for me

I can tell when we touch

Was meant for you and me

Hold me to it thrill me all through it
Make me live up to what I promised you

The warmth and your embrace
I wondered if you'd still recall

You're there to save my life for our obvious goal
We've got a head start for happiness
For our part, guess we must be blessed
For this feeling to be so strong
Tell me is that so wrong?
The space between us for days has been so far;
I've spent a lonely week Now I wanna be where you are
We've got a headstart for happiness, 
For our part, Guess we must be kissed by 
This force I feel inside
Now I'm not gonna hide.
All the roads that lead to struggles
bring you back to where you need
Some reassurance in your own depth,
only you can see, but let others feel
Peace in my mind I'm so happy to find
As I get on my trek with a head start back to you.
You'll find it can happen
You'll find you've got the strength
You can move a mountain
You just need the confidence
In yourself and all you've got 
To take this world and shake it up
Let no one say they're better than you
You must believe you've got the power
To rise above the lies
Cause what we're dealing here with today is a love thing
Right here, right now
Now listen
When I find you waiting hours, oh
It's my heart, not my head that takes control
And you've got to lead where your heart says go
and this hope that it turns out so
And that's all that you can hope for
Can you expect much more?
Naive and wise with no sense of time
As I set my clock with a heart beat, tick tock
Violent and mild, common sense says I'm wild
With this mixed up fury, crazy beauty
It's healthy to find all these feelings inside
As I get on my trek with a head start back to you.

When the words of love song touch the very heart of me.
There'll be sad songs to make you cry, love songs often do,
They can, touch the heart of someone new, saying I love you, I love you.
I often wonder how it could be,
you loving me, two hearts in perfect harmony.
I'll count the hours until that day,
the rhapsody plays a melody for you and me.
Until the moment that you give your love to me,
you’re the one I care for, the one I will wait for.

You    Right then and there I knew I was through (Dorothy Parker was cool)
My pants were wet, they came off
But she didn't see the movie cuz she hadn't read the book first
Instead she pretended she was blind
An affliction brought on by a witch's curse
Dorothy made me laugh (ha ha, ha ha)
I felt much better so I went back to the violent room
(Tell us what you did, what you did) Let me tell you what I did
   I took another bubble bath
    with my pants on
  All the fighting stopped
Next time I'll do it soo-
-ner
This is the ballad of Dorothy Parker
(Dorothy Parker Dorothy Parker)

You are my shining star my guiding light my love fantasy
There's not a minute, hour, day or night that I don't love you
You're at the top of my list 'cause I'm always thinking of ya
I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreamin' plannin' how to say ""I love you""
You must have known that I had feelings deep enough to swim in
That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in
Oh my love,      a thousand kisses from you
Is never too much,      I just don't wanna stop
Oh my love,      a million days in your arms
Is never too much,      I just don't wanna stop
Never too much, never too much
Woke up today, looked at your picture just to get me started
I called you up but you weren't there and I was broken hearted
Hung up the phone, can't be too late, the boss is so demandin'
Opened the door up and to my surprise there you were standin'
Who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar?
I'd rather be with you 'cause you make my heart scream and holler
Love is a gamble and I'm so glad that I am winnin'
We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning
Oh my love,      a thousand kisses from you
Is never too much (never too much, never too much, never too much)
I just don't wanna stop
Oh my love,      a million days in your arms
Is never too much (never too much, never too much, never too much)

Taking a walk through the snow
Listening to a children's choir
Singing songs about Jesus
The blessed way that He came to us

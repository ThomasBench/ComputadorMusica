This magic spell you cast
This is la vie en rose
When you kiss me, heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see la vie en rose
When you press me to your heart
I'm in a world apart
A world where roses bloom
And when you speak, angels sing from above
Everyday words seem
To turn into love songs
Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be
La vie en rose
And when you speak, angels sing from above
Everyday words seem
To turn into love songs
Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be
La vie en rose

1,Like Im Gonna Lose You (ver 2),Meghan Trainor,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/meghan-trainor/like-im-gonna-lose-you-chords-1715372,"  I found myself dreaming
  In silver and gold
  Like a scene from a movie
That every broken heart knows
  We were walking on moonlight
  And you pulled me close
  Split second and you disappeared
And then I was all alone
I woke up in tears with you by my side
Breath of relief
And I realized
No, we're not promised tomorrow
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lo-se you
  In the blink of an eye
  Just a whisper of smoke
  You could lose everything
The truth is you never know
  So I'll kiss you longer baby
  Any chance that I get
  And I'll make the most of the minutes
And love with no regrets
Let's take our time to say what we want
Use what we got before it's all gone
'Cause no, we're not promised tomorrow
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lo-se you
I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lo-se you

2,Take Me To Church (ver 2),Hozier,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/hozier/take-me-to-church-chords-1513312," My lover's got humor, she's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval, I should've worshipped her sooner
If the Heavens ever did speak, she’s the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak, a fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it
 My church offers no absolutes, she tells me 'worship in the bedroom'
The only heaven I'll be sent to is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it. Command me to be well
A-A-A-A-A-  Amen Amen Amen
         Take me to church I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death, good God, let me give you my life
 If I'm a pagan of the good times, my lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side she demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea, get something shiny
 Something meaty for the main course, that's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable? We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty, that looks plenty, this is hungry work
 Take me to church I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death, good God, let me give you my life
 No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human, only then I am clean     Oh
Oh   Amen  Amen  Amen
 Take me to church I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

Will last me all my life
So should we
I'm spending all this time
Met you at the shop, sun was getting hot, I'm lonely
I'm in the city on my own
Never would've thought you'd be the one, I got a homie
But that's the way it goes
I'm reaching nirvana

Finally, I can see you crystal clear.
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare.
See how I leave, with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do.
There's a fire starting in my heart,
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling...
We could have had it all... (You're gonna wish you, never had met me)...
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart... (You're gonna wish you)... Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
And you played it... (Tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (Rolling in the deep)
Baby, I have no story to be told,
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn.
Think of me in the depths of your despair.
Making a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared.
    The scars of your love, remind me of us.
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling...

You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow.

The light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain 
And cut her woes away
'Cause covergirls don't cry 
But there's a hope 
That's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful 
Just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, 
We're stars and we're beautiful
Oh oh oh    oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh    oh oh oh oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, 
We're stars and we're beautiful
She has dreams to be 
An envy, so she's 
covergirls eat nothing she says 
""Beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
She fades away
She don't see her perfect, 
She don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface
Oh Oh
Oh oh
So to all the girls that's hurting
Let me be your mirror, 
Help you see a little bit clearer
There's a hope 
That's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful 
Just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, 
We're stars and we're beautiful

By once or twice I mean maybe a couple hundred times

It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone
I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance, come on

It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on

Gotta see it to believe it, sky never looked so blue
So hard to leave it, that's what I always do
So I keep thinking back to a time under the canyon moon
The world's happy waitin', door's yellow, broken blue
I heard Jenny saying, ""Go get the kids from school""
And I keep thinking back to the time under the canyon moon
I'll be gone too long from you
Staring at the ceiling, two weeks and I'll be home
Carry the feeling, through Paris, all through Rome
And I'm still thinking back to the time under the canyon moon
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going home
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going

Quick pause in conversation, she plays songs I've never heard
And I keep thinking back to the time under the canyon moon

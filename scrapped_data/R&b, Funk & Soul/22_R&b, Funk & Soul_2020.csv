Then fumble all my words and let you twist them
To all the ugly things you tell me I am
So hard to understand how I'm the
Master, manipulator
Who couldn't fool anyone
The monster, reciprocator
Shot no bullets from my gun
The drama queen
To get applause from anyone
I won't be who you say I am
If I sang a song
Would you listen?
Or would you tell me that I'm terrible?
I won't play along
This game is twisted
And I think that would make me terrible
That would make me

Everything you fear is gonna end
All your hate and hurt lost to the wind
And it’s hard, I know the universe can be a jealous friend
But everything you fear is gonna end

And black holes slowly dancing in the dark

About the end of everything
Until it all goes up in one last spark

But so is everything so wipe your eyes
You know nothin’ lasts forever but lord, we try

We’re blessed then we obliterate
And that’s how it was written from the start

Don't leave the house at midnight and expect the birds to sing

Sometimes, it's time to let a good thing die
You can't conjure up more money if you've only got a dime
No use praying for your younger days if you're running out of time
You can take a horse to water, but you can't teach fish to fly
Sometimes, it's time to let a good thing die
You can't light a fire from nothing, or clap and make snow fall
You can't summon love up in your heart if it isn't there at all
Life isn't like the movies, but it sure will make you cry
When it dawns on you it's time to say goodbye
You can't drum up the heartbeats of loved ones come to pass
Stop wishing for forever 'cause nothing ever lasts

I wonder what she thinks of me

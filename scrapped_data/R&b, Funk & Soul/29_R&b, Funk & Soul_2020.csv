Zombies surround me
I'm out of place, I feel so weak
People starin' at me
I crave the quiet
 I love the silence
  Wanna be told a bedtime story
Then not wake up in the morning
Something here doesn't feel right
My skin burns, I start to cry
The winter
   suits me better (Ah-oh)
The winter
   suits me better (Uh-oh)
Where are you? Call me
Breathe that I was in your dream
Couldn't run and couldn't scream
Start collectin' all my teeth
But I've got bad news, babe
For your news front page
I swear I saw you right there
But that's what happens when you find
A creature that was left outside
The winter
   suits me better (Ah-oh)
The winter
   suits me better (Uh-oh)
The winter
   suits me better (Ah-oh)
The winter
   suits me better (Uh-oh)

   suits me better (Uh-oh)

You're my bulletproof vest when it's getting dangerous.
Always make me feel blessed, you're my Guardian Angel.
You are, you are, you are.
You are, you are, you are.
You put your body on mine when they're taking aim.
You're the pin in my heart, it's a hand grenade.
You are, you are, you are.
The cure for all my scars.
I feel like you could save me now.
When I'm suicidal, don't let me spiral.
You make my heartbeat faster than adrenalin.
You kiss away the pain of all the hell i'm in.
You're gonna make me better than I've ever been.
Coz you're my Medicine, you're my Medicine
You make my heartbeat faster than adrenalin.
You take the pain whenever I'm in hell again.
I know you'll make me better than I've ever been.
Coz you're my Medicine, you're my Medicine
You always say we should move to LA.
I'll buy you a plane and I'll fly you away.
You are my heroine, you're my escape.
Everything gonna be Gucci today.
I feel like you could save me now.
I know I hurt you. I don't deserve you.
You make my heartbeat faster than adrenalin.
You kiss away the pain of all the hell i'm in.
You're gonna make me better than I've ever been.

You make my heartbeat faster than adrenalin.
You take the pain whenever I'm in hell again.
I know you'll make me better than I've ever been.
Coz you're my Medicine, you're my Medicine
I love the way you look in that Balenciaga.
One sip of you, I'm hooked, I wanna hit it harder.
No drug could feel this good,
Now I'm addicted to you.
You make my heartbeat faster than adrenalin.
You kiss away the pain of all the hell i'm in.
You're gonna make me better than I've ever been.

Getting fried is how I'm dodging gravestones
 You look like me when you lie
Boiled blood star shifts in the window of my eye
 You put warm salt to the stitch
And I suffer for the sky that you shook nine times
You smell like burnt hibiscus
I still feel blessed even when we're bitching
 You stole my spine for a minute
So I cut my hair just to make you smile
Making rainbows out of something painful
Getting fried is how I'm dodging gravestones
Making rainbows out of something painful
Getting fried is how I'm dodging gravestones

41,Cuándo Olvidaré,C. Tangana,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/3645257,"Nostalgia, de escuchar su risa loca
Y sentir junto a mi boca
Como un fuego su respiración
Angustia, de sentirme abandonado
Y pensar que otro a su lado
Pronto le hablará de amor
Hermano, yo no quiero rebajarme
Ni pedirle ni rogarle
Ni decirle que no puedo más vivir
Hermano, esta mujer va a matarme
Se ha propuesto de humillarme
Es feliz con mi sufrir
Cuándo olvidaré
Las noches que me has querido
Cuándo olvidaré
Las noches que me has querido

Heart is hard, and can nobody can see me
I wanna be there for the ones that need me
I can't stand the pain I see on TV
Jealous 'cause they wanna be me
Damn it man, this life ain't easy
It takes over me
Unforgiveness keeps control of me
Damnit, I gotta get a hold of me

  You know, mm
Only two years old I was playin' drums on the table
Guess I knew it was the only thing stable
When I was young, I could pick things up quick
Anything that I did, I was pretty good at it
Well, I started school, I was a troublemaker
Thought I knew everything in life, yeah, that caught up to me later
I had to learn about humility
I had to grow up and accept responsibility, yeah
That wasn't easy 'cause at 17 I had a milli'
Women throwin' themselves at me had me goin' silly
On the surface, I felt like the man
But deep inside I felt deprived just like an empty can
I've had everything in life that people strive for
Just to ask the question: ""What are we alive for?""
What you believe? And would you agree?
Well, who would you die for?
Is there a reason? What is the meanin'? What do we cry for?
One thing I know is that we're in this together, together, oh
One thing I know is that we're in this together, together, oh
We're in this together
I moved out when I was 18
I was livin' in a mansion doin' big things
FBI raided my house and shit was gettin' dicey
I was doin' stupid shit to get people to like me
All that to say, I'm thankful that's not who I am
And I'm thankful God was with me when shit hit the fan
'Cause He's the reason that I'm still standin'
And even in a pandemic, God is still plannin'
Plannin' peace, plannin' joy, plan another day
Gave His life upon the cross to wash His sins away
I've had everything in life that people strive for
Just to ask the question: ""What are we alive for?""
What you believe? And would you agree?

One thing I know is that we're in this together, together, oh
We're in this together
 I pray for every single person listening to this song right now
I pray for peace. I pray for joy. I pray for confidence. I pray for reassurance
I thank you so much for the person listening to this right now
I pray that You would bless them
Bless their mind, bless their finances
Bless their family, bless their sons, bless their daughters, bless their moms, bless their dads, bless their
grandparents
God, I just pray for an overwhelming sense of Your presence in their home right now
An overwhelming sense of Your peace that says, ""Everything is going to be all right.""
In the name of Jesus
In the name of Jesus
Where You go I follow (Follow, follow)
You're with me every step of the way
Here in the struggle (Struggle, struggle)
Your love's enough to wash it all away
  On the third day, yeah, You rose up
And you beat death once and for all (Once and for all)
Once and for all (Once and for all)
There's nobody like You
There's nobody like You, Jesus (Jesus, Jesus)
There'll never nobody like You
There'll never nobody like You, Jesus (Jesus, Jesus)
Sometimes this world is feeling crazy
At times my mind is feeling hazy
But Lord You always come and save me
God Almighty, my safety
You're my end, You're my new beginning
You're my home, The One I confide in
You're the very air I breathe
The reason that I sing
Oh, I've tried it all
Nothing could fix the damage in my heart
'Til I met Your love
Oh, You gave Your life so I won't fall apart
On the third day, yeah, You rose up
And you beat death once and for all (Once and for all)
Oh, oh, once and for all
Yeah, yeah, yeah
There's nobody like You
There's nobody like You, Jesus (Jesus, Jesus)
There'll never nobody like You
There'll never nobody like You, Jesus (Jesus, Jesus)
Why? Why is there nobody like Jesus?
As in billion of mens and women lived on this planet
But why, why are we convinced there's nobody like Jesus?
Was He not merely a teacher, a prophet
An exegeter, an Explainer and yet we find ourselves in history wondering
""Is there anyone like Jesus?
Who is this Jesus?""
This Man from the Middle East who claims to be God
Is He God? Is He sinless? Is He perfection?
Is He the once and for all sacrifice for humanity?
Is He a man without fear?
Did He become sin so that you and I might be right in our relationship with God
Is there nobody like Jesus?
Did He die between two criminals on the crucifixion?
Three days later did He rise again as the grave empty?
Has He defeated death, Hell in the grave and sin itself?
If so there is nobody like Jesus (Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus)
 When the day is over
And those thoughts set in
 That’s when I start to wonder
Where do I fit in?
But then You remind me that you’re holding me tight
You say the past is behind me and it’ll be alright
  And you say to me,
It’ll be alright
When I’m all alone and
Fear is all I see
Sitting in the silence with these insecurities
It's then You remind me, You’re holding me tight
And You love me completely, You're always by my side
And you say to me
It’ll be alright
  I know you’re not a GOD out there hiding on mountains,   oh no
 You come right where I am, lost my way but You found me
Like the rain in the dark on my ugliest days
You say that You’ll always love me just the same
And then You remind me that You’re holding me tight
You said the past is behind me and it will be alright
And you say to me
It’ll be alright
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Gonna be alright, gonna be alright
It will, it will be alright
I'm afraid to say the wrong thing
Criticized from every angle
And I'm afraid to lay it on the line
And selfishly I wanna hold back
Do we got the room to make mistakes?
Are we judged for everything we said? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I wanna grow but I'm afraid (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And will it always be the same? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Does what I gotta say even matter? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Is life about climbing up the ladder
And can we even see lives that are shattered?
'Cause I'm really tryna silence the chatter
What have we done with society?
When everybody's getting canceled
And can't there be room for maturity?
'Cause writing 'em off is not the answer
Do we got the room to make mistakes? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, do we?)
Are we judged for everything we said? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, are we?)
I wanna grow but I'm afraid (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And will it always be the same? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Does what I gotta say even matter? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

And can we even see lives that are shattered?
'Cause I'm really tryna silence the chatter
What have we done with society?
When everybody's getting canceled (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
And can't there be room for maturity?
'Cause writing 'em off is not the answer
We can't write people off
Even in our darkest days, even when we least deserve it
Even when we're doing that stupid thing we wish we weren't doing
God never writes us off, ever
He's with us in our pain, He's with us in our struggle
He's with us in our bad decisions
He's with us all the time, He never writes us off   (He never writes us off)
You formed the whole of me (Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
Inward and out (Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
I am awesomely and wonderfully created (Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
Your creations are spectacular
You skillfully designed me (Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
You saw the essence of me, before I was formed
Before I existed, all of my days were written in your book

Just to ask the question: ""What are we alive for?""
What you believe? And would you agree?
Well, who would you die for?
Is there a reason? What is the meanin'? What do we cry for?
One thing I know is that we're in this together, together, oh
One thing I know is that we're in this together, together, oh
We're in this together
I moved out when I was 18
I was livin' in a mansion doin' big things
FBI raided my house and shit was gettin' dicey
I was doin' stupid shit to get people to like me
All that to say, I'm thankful that's not who I am
And I'm thankful God was with me when shit hit the fan
'Cause He's the reason that I'm still standin'
And even in a pandemic, God is still plannin'
Plannin' peace, plannin' joy, plan another day
Gave His life upon the cross to wash His sins away
I've had everything in life that people strive for
Just to ask the question: ""What are we alive for?""
What you believe? And would you agree?
Well, who would you die for?
Is there a reason? What is the meanin'? What do we cry for?
One thing I know is that we're in this together, together, oh
One thing I know is that we're in this together, together, oh
We're in this together
 I pray for every single person listening to this song right now
I pray for peace. I pray for joy. I pray for confidence. I pray for reassurance
I thank you so much for the person listening to this right now
I pray that You would bless them
Bless their mind, bless their finances
grandparents
God, I just pray for an overwhelming sense of Your presence in their home right now
An overwhelming sense of Your peace that says, ""Everything is going to be all right.""
In the name of Jesus
In the name of Jesus

Criticized from every angle
And I'm afraid to lay it on the line
And selfishly I wanna hold back
Do we got the room to make mistakes?
Are we judged for everything we said? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I wanna grow but I'm afraid (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And will it always be the same? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Does what I gotta say even matter? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Is life about climbing up the ladder
And can we even see lives that are shattered?
'Cause I'm really tryna silence the chatter
What have we done with society?
When everybody's getting canceled
And can't there be room for maturity?
'Cause writing 'em off is not the answer
Do we got the room to make mistakes? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, do we?)
Are we judged for everything we said? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, are we?)
I wanna grow but I'm afraid (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And will it always be the same? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Does what I gotta say even matter? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Is life about climbing up the ladder
And can we even see lives that are shattered?
'Cause I'm really tryna silence the chatter
What have we done with society?
When everybody's getting canceled (Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
And can't there be room for maturity?
'Cause writing 'em off is not the answer
We can't write people off
Even in our darkest days, even when we least deserve it
Even when we're doing that stupid thing we wish we weren't doing
God never writes us off, ever
He's with us in our pain, He's with us in our struggle
He's with us in our bad decisions
He's with us all the time, He never writes us off   (He never writes us off)
You formed the whole of me (Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
Inward and out (Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
I am awesomely and wonderfully created (Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
Your creations are spectacular
You skillfully designed me (Ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
You saw the essence of me, before I was formed
Before I existed, all of my days were written in your book

47,Deep Summer In The Deep South,Rumer,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/rumer/deep-summer-in-the-deep-south-chords-3650060,"Andalusia, Alabama,
In the August heat,
Hot enough to fry an egg,
On the cobblestones,
It’s too hot to put your clothes on,
It’s too hot to eat,
Mama says you’re just,
All skin and lazy bones,
All day long a Coca-Cola,
Is all you can think of,
Late at night your body gets so,
Thirsty for his love, it’s just.
Deep Summer,
In The Deep South,
All that constant perspiration,
Always makes a body pout,
Drippin’ sweet nothings,
From your honeysuckle mouth,
Now you’re drowning in,
Deep Summer,
In The Deep South.
You go knockin’ on his window,
When the moon is full,
Then you slip down to the river,
For a skinny dip,
Ain’t no tellin’ what can happen,
When push comes to pull,
And your heart starts melting,
In the summer’s grip,
Ain’t no way you can describe it,
How he makes you feel,
It’s like the river took you in its arms,
And swept you to Mobile, it’s just.
Deep Summer,
In The Deep South,
All that constant perspiration,
Always makes a body pout,
Drippin’ sweet nothings,
From your honeysuckle mouth,
Now you’re drowning in,
Deep Summer,
In The Deep South.
Don’t know how you’re gonna stand it,
How much your heart aches,
All that you can do is hold on ‘til that,
Scarlet fever breaks, it’s just.
Deep Summer,
In The Deep South.

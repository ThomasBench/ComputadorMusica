You don't know why or where I'm coming from
And in my head I'm close to you
We're in the rain still searching for the sun
You think that I wanna run and hide
I keep it all locked up inside
I just want you to find me
I'm not lost, I'm not lost, just undiscovered
And when we're alone we're all the same as each other
You see the look thats on my face
You might think I'm out of place
I'm not lost, no no, just undiscovered
Well the time it takes to know someone
It all can change before you know its gone
So close your eyes and feel the way
I'm with you now believe there's nothing wrong
You think that I wanna run and hide
I keep it all locked up inside
I just want you to find me
I'm not lost, I'm not lost, just undiscovered
And when we're alone we're all the same as each other
You see the look thats on my face
You might think I'm out of place
Im not lost, no no, just undiscovered
I'm not running, I'm not hiding
If you dig a little deeper you will find me
I'm not lost, I'm not lost, just undiscovered
And when we're alone we're all the same as each other
You see the look thats on my face
You might think I'm out of place
Im not lost, no no, just undiscovered

I've got to break free

I might be singing out of key
But it sure feels good to me
Got a right to be wrong... So just leave me alone

But it's really my decision
I can't turn back, I'm on a mission
If you care don't you dare blur my vision
Let me be all that I can be
Don't smother me with negativity
Whatever's out there waiting for me
I'm going to face it willingly.

He's a one stop shop, makes the panties drop
He's a sweet-talkin', sugar coated candy man

He took me to the Spider Club at Hollywood and Vine
We drank champagne and we danced all night
We shook the paparazzi for a big surprise
The gossip tonight will be tomorrow's headline

Girl you could have stayed 
But you wouldn't give me a chance
With you not around it's a little bit more than I can stand

So why does your pride make you run and hide?

You got me feeling crazy (crazy)
   How can you walk away,
Everything stays the same
I just can't do it baby
  What will it take to make you come back
Girl I told you what it is and it just ain't like that
No why can't you look at me, you're still in love with me
Don't leave me crying.
Baby why can't we just start over again
Get it back to the way it was
If you give me a chance I can love you right

Let's go to the park
I wanna kiss you underneath the stars
Maybe we'll go too far
We just don't care,
We just don't care,
You know I love you when you're loving me
Sometimes it's better when it's publicly
I'm not ashamed, I don't care who sees
Us hugging & kissing 
our love exhibition all
We'll rendezvous out on the fire escape
I'd like to set off an alarm today
The love emergency don't make me wait
Just follow I'll lead you
I urgently need you
Let's go to the park
I wanna kiss you underneath the stars
Maybe we'll go too far
We just don't care,
We just don't care,
Let's make love, 
Let's go somewhere they might discover us
Let's get lost in lust
We just don't care,
We just don't care,
We just don't care.
I see you closing down the restaurant
Let's sneak and do it when your boss is gone
Everybody's leaving we'll have some fun
Or maybe it's wrong but you're turning me on.
Ooh, we'll take a visit to your Mama's house
Creep to the bedroom while your Mama's out
Maybe she'll hear it when we scream and shout
And we'll keep it rocking until she comes knocking
Let's go to the park
I wanna kiss you underneath the stars
Maybe we'll go too far

We just don't care,

Let's get lost in lust
We just don't care,

If we keep up on this fooling around
We'll be the talk of the town
I'll tell the world I'm in love any time
Let's open up the blinds 'cause we really don't mind
Ooh I don't care about the propriety
Let's break the rules and ignore society
Maybe our neighbors like to spy, it's true
So what if they watch when we do what we do

I wanna kiss you underneath the stars
Maybe we'll go too far

I'm so used to being next to you
Life for me is not the same
There's no-one to talk to
Don't know why I let it go too far
Starting over it's so hard
Seems like everhwere I try to go
I keep thinking of you
I just had a wakeup call
Wishing that I never let you fall
Baby your not to blame at all
When I'm the one that pushed you away
Baby if you knew I care
You never would I've went
Girl I should have been right there
How do I breathe
Without you here by my side
How will I see
When your love brought me to the light
Where do I go
When your hearts where I lay my head
How do I breathe
How do I breathe

I cant get over you no
Baby I dont wanna let go

Age eight I got a Jheri curl
Thirteen and I got a relaxer
I was a source of so much laughter
At fifteen when it all broke off
Eighteen and went all natural
February two thousand and two
I went on and did what I had to do
Because it was time to change my life
To become the women that I am inside
Ninety-seven dreadlocks all gone
I looked in the mirror for the first time and saw that HEY....
I am not my hair
I am not this skin
I am not your expectations no no
I am not my hair
I am not this skin
I am a soul that lives within
Good hair means curls and waves
Bad hair means you look like a slave
At the turn of the century
Its time for us to redefine who we be
You can shave it off
Or get in on lock
You can rock it straight
If its not what's on your head
Its what's underneath and say HEY....
I am not my hair
I am not this skin
I am not your expectations no no
I am not my hair
I am not this skin
I am a soul that lives within

Breast Cancer and Chemotherapy
Took away her crown and glory
She promised God if she was to survive
She would enjoy everyday of her life ooh
On national television
Her diamond eyes are sparkling
Bald headed like a full moon shining
Singing out to the whole wide world like HEY...
I am not my hair
I am not this skin
I am not your expectations no no
I am not my hair
I am not this skin
I am a soul that lives within   x2

Aldrig nöjd
Usch, hur kunde jag dejta det där?
Att jag trodde det skulle fungera
Det började bra, men sen efter nån dag
Försvann all hans charm och han blekna
Det var inte den första i år
Och definitivt inte sista
Det brukar bubbla från start
Med spännande prat
Romantiska möten med kyssar
Men sen tröttna jag direkt
Vilken äcklig andedräkt
Hans irriterande tics
Han är royalist
Jag förtjänar faktiskt något bättre
Jag lovar, jag kan fixa vem jag vill
Aldrig nöjd, jag blir aldrig nöjd
För lång eller kort eller smal eller bred
Jag vill hitta rätt men jag ser bara fel
Aldrig nöjd, jag blir aldrig nöjd
Ingen kan vara perfekt, det kan jag förstå
Men herregud, jag kan få bättre än så
Jag har verkligen provat med allt
Jag har träffat, för fan, hela världen
Från Paris till Shanghai, slitna jeans och kavaj
Jag har till och med surfat på nätet
Men jag blir aldrig nöjd, nej, jag stör mig på allt
Han skriver så fult och han sjunger så falskt
Vilken läskig mustasch, alldeles för lat
Var är hans sinne för humor?
Nej, jag hittar ingenting
Ingen groda som blir min prins
Bara genomsnittsskräp, inte tillräckligt tät
Varför ska jag nöja mig med nåt mindre,
När jag vet jag kan fixa vem jag vill?

Dom har vart stygga, dom har vart dryga

You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gonna live it up
She make me beg for it till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say you the fucking best, you the fucking best
You the fucking best, you the fucking best
You the best I ever had, best I ever had
Best I ever had, best I ever had, I say you the fucking...
Know you got a roommate, call me when it's no one there
Put the key under the mat, and you know I'll be over there
I'll be over there, shawty, I'll be over there
I'll be hitting all the spots that you ain't even know was there
Ha, and you all ain't even have to ask twice
You can have my heart or we can share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a n**** thinking that he met you in a past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest, I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say you ain't bringin' Drake along
You know that I'm working, I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to them rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one they never get confused with
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger than you ever done it

Best I ever had, best I ever had, I say you the fucking...
Sex, love, pain, baby, I be on that tank shit
Buzz so big, I could probably sell a blank disk
When my album drop, bitches will buy it for the picture
And n****s will buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine, paper, girl, but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feeling for a fix then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fucking bra strap pop
All up in yo slot until the n**** hit the jackpot
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it

Just let it die with no goodbyes
Details don't matter, we both paid the price
Tears in my eyes
You know sometimes it'd be like that, baby
   Now every time I see you, I pretend I'm fine
   When I wanna reach out to you
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride
Baby, I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
  And don't forget about
  Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
 I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
  I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
 When it's for real, it's forever
Oh, they say that you're in a new relationship
 But we both know nothing comes close to
  What we had, it perseveres
 That we both can't forget it
 How good we used to get it
  There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine (We used to shine)
No matter who you go through
We are one, that's a fact that you can't deny
So, baby, we just can't let the fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret
 So don't forget about
  Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
 I can see it in your eyes, you still want it

Nothing can compare to your first true love
 When it's for real, it's forever
 And if she's got your head all messed up now
So why you act like you don't know how this loving used to be?
  I bet she can't do it like me
 She'll never be MC
 Baby, don't you, don't you forget about us
  Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
 I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
  I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
 When it's for real, it's forever
  Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms

and time is spinning fast.
It´s so amazing
how you came into my life.
I know it seems all hope is gone,
I know you feel you can´t be strong;
and once again the story ends with you and I.
And anytime you feel like
you just can´t get on,
just hold on to my love
     and you´ll never be aloooone.
   Hold on,
we can make it through the fire.
     And my love,
I´m forever by your side.
And you know
if you should ever call my name,
I´ll be right there;
           you´ll never be alone.
Hopeless to describe,
the way I feel for you
no matter how I tried,
words could never do!
I looked into your eyes to find
as long as love is alive.
There ain´t nothing
we can make it through.
Anytime, or
if only for a while
don´t worry, make a wish.
I´ll be there to see your smile , oohh!!
   Hold on,
we can make it through the fire
and my love
I´m forever by your side.
And you  know
if you should ever call my name,
I´ll be right there,
You´ll never be alone.
Through the fire, by your side
I will be there for you so love don't you worry.
(Don't you know, I'll be there)
you'll never be  a -  alone     heya heyeaaaah
   Hold on,
we can make it through the fire
and my love
I´m forever by your side.
And you  know
if you should ever call my name,
I´ll be right there,
You´ll never be alone.

I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough
And it was all in vain
Time starts to pass
Before you know it you're frozen
But something happened
For the very first time with you
My heart melts into the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking round
Thinking I'm going crazy
But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein
That I keep on closing
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open
Trying hard not to hear
But they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears
Try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that the goal
Is to keep me from falling
But nothing's greater
Than the rush that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness
I see your face
Yet everyone around me
Thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe
But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth

Through the bridal path door
And ever since that day I haven't wanted anyone but you

     Let me know I'd never seen the moon before

As though it had no flaws
But to compare it to a beauty like   yours
Would give one pause
Nothing about you   is false
That's why your love is real
That's why your love is real love
God forbid   if you belonged to another
I'd have to take you from your man
I might be tempted to break the law 'round here

it must have been about quarter past three,
In front of me stood a beautiful honey
with a beautiful body,
I said it'd cost her her name, six digit number
and a date with me tomorrow at nine.
Did she decline? No.
Didn't she mind? I don't think so.
Was it for real? Damn sure.
What was the deal? A pretty girl aged 24.
So was she keen? She couldn't wait.
Cinnamon queen? Let me update.
What did she say? She said she'd love to, rendezvous.
She asked me what we were gonna do,
said we'd start with a bottle of moet for two.
Monday: took her for a drink on Tuesday,
we were making love by Wednesday,
and on Thursday and Friday and Saturday we chilled on Sunday.
I met this girl on Monday, took her for a drink on Tuesday,
we were making love by Wednesday,
and on Thursday and Friday and Saturday we chilled on Sunday.
Nine was the time 'cause I'll be getting  mine,
and she was looking fine.
Smooth talker, she told me,
she'd love to unfold me all night long.
Ooh, I loved the way she kicked it
from the front to back she flipped it.
(back she flipped it, ooh the way she kicked it)
And I oh oh I yeah, hope that she'd care,
'cause I'm a man who'll always be there.
Ooh yeah, I'm not a man to play around, baby.
Ooh yeah, 'cause a one night stand isn't really fair.
From the first impression girl hmm,
'Cause there's no need to chat
for there'll be plenty for that.
From the subway to my home,
endless ringing of my phone.
When you feeling all alone,
all you gotta do is just call me, call me.
Monday: took her for a drink on Tuesday,
we were making love by Wednesday,
and on Thursday and Friday and Saturday we chilled on Sunday.
I met this girl on Monday, took her for a drink on Tuesday,

Since I met this special lady, ooh yeah,
I can't get her off my mind, she's one of a kind.
And I ain't about to deny it,
it's a special kind thing with you, oh...

I don't have a key for downstairs
So I punched all the buzzers
Hoping you wouldn't be there
And now my head's hurting
You say I always get my own way
But you were in the shower when I got there
And I'd have wanted to stay
But I got nothing to say
You were so beautiful
Before today
But then I heard what you say
Man that was ugly
The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there, I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Just take it
Take the box
Take the box
I came home this evening
And nothing felt like how it should be
I feel like writing you a letter
But that's not me
You made me feel so fucking angry
Don't wanna be reminded of you
But when I left my shit in your kitchen
I said goodbye to your bedroom
It smelled of you
Mr. False Pretence, you don't make sense
I just don't know you
But you made me cry, where's my kiss goodbye?
I think I love you
The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Frank's in there, I don't care
Put it in the box, put it in the box
Now take it

Just take it, take it

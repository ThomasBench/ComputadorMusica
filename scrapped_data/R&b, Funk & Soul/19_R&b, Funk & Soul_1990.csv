Makes me feel,
Like a Schoolboy on good time.
Jugglin' nickels and dimes
Satisfied,
With te fish on the line.
I've been down the road,
And I've come back,
Lonesome whistle on the railroad track.
Ain't got nothin' of those feelins
That I had.
Something so hard to find,
Situation,
That can casualize your mind.
I've been down the road,
And I've come back,
Lonesome whistle on the railroad track.
Ain't got nothin' of those feelins
That I had.
Baby mellow my mind,

Jugglin' nickels and dimes

With te fish on the line.

I can't possess

what lovers are look'n for. A stranger here, a stranger there

something that a cheaters heart is bound to learn.

people to the point of no return.

Is paved with good intentions
And I've paved a lane or two myself
And blessed the mother of invention

But there are few who want to pay the toll
If you're rich or if you're poor 
You know it really doesn't matter
Cause' you gotta' pay the price with your soul

He walks into the room but doesn't take off his coat
Kisses me softly without saying a word, now
There's that look in his eyes that makes me feel the cold
When I try to find out 'bout what's troubling his mind
He turns away and sighs and says give me some time
Maybe things would get better if I learned to be patient
What I wanted was love not an imitation and I know it

For a fall, we're heading for a fall
We're heading for a fall
We're heading for a fall

Me, I'm trying to sleep but I'm trembling inside

Why stay if it's her that he wants in the end?
If he tried to explain, I'd try to understand
Maybe I'd feel the same I'm not sure of myself
We surrendered so soon in the arms of temptation now

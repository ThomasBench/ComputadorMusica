A la altura, pues

Trata de una mujer?

Que soy la belicosa

Miedo a la' mujere' poderosa'?

Luna me llaman criminal

Romance, cuchillo y dinero

Ajá, mujer con hambre de poder

Ya no pido perdón ni permiso
(Tengan cuida'o) (mira)
Me dispararon en el corazón

Like my heart was once, but now it's closin'

Disappointed is the least I could say
Who knew these women would lead you astray?
I guess you just wanna live life outside a cage (A cage)

Wish I listened when they told me, ""Don't ever accept no favors""
2AM in the parking garage, it's clearly a no brainer
Should've left you last July, but I was only tryna save us
Maybe it's these memories or maybe it's the chase
Or maybe it's whenever I roll over to your face
Whatever it is, I know you don't wanna be saved
No, I never thought it would go up in flames

The children raise themselves
Once I was alive
Breathing in the air
Now the more I lie
The less I lose my hair
Now the road is wide
Now the people stare
Waiting open-eyed
For once a meaning there
For one can see the light
Underneath the bed
For months there at a time
Believing every thread
And months would flutter by
And fears would all have fled
And it'll all be fine
At least that's what you said
Whoa
I want to buy a house
I want to make a stand
I want to love a girl
I want to love a man
I want to kill the past
I want to stop the sand
I want another chance
But one is all you have
But if once more I could feel
What I felt before
I'd hold it like it's real
I'd never let it fall
I'd blow up every bridge
I'd build up every wall
And nothing could get in
But nothing could be born
Whoa
Whoa
And everything looks nice
Nothing is unwell
But once the fruit of God
Forever live in hell
And once you choose a side
There's nothing left to win
And once a lover dies
You never love again

How can one become so bounded by choices that somebody   else makes?
How come we both become a version of a person we don't even like?
We're in love with the world but the world just wants to bring us  down
By puttin' ideals in our heads to corrupt our hearts somehow
When I was a child every single thing could blow my mind
Soaking it all up for fun but now I only soak up wine
They say to play hard, you work hard, find balance in the sacrifice
And yet I don't know anybody who's truly satisfied
You better believe I'm trying,        to keep climbing
But the higher we climb feels like we're both none the wiser
So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop trying to be   somebody else
So we can love each other for free, yeah
Everybody wants something, you just want me
Why am I obsessing about the things I can't control?
Why am I seeking approval from people I don't even know?
In these crazy times I hope I can find something I can cling onto
'Cause I need some substance in my life, something real, something that feels true
You better believe for you I've cried,         high tides
Cause I want you so bad, but you can't fight fire with fire
So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop trying to be   somebody else
Oh I just want to love you, love you, for free, yeah
'Cause everybody wants something from me,   you just want me
Listen, I know how low I can go, I give as good as I get
You get the brunt of it all 'cause you're all I've got left
Oh, I hope in time, we both will find, peace of mind
Sometimes the road less traveled is the road best left behind
So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop trying to be   somebody else
Oh I just want to love you, love you, for free, yeah
'Cause everybody wants something from me,   you just want me
You better believe I'm trying,        to keep climbing
But the higher we climb feels like we're both none the wiser
The only regret I have                 I wish that it was just at a different time
A most turbulent period of my life
Why would I put that on you? That's just, like, a very heavy thing to have to talk about
But because of that period of time, even though it was so much fun
I didn't get to go on and make new memories with him, there were just memories in a big

Thinking you would do the same
No regrets, no mistakes
Growin' up is strange when the one who's to blame
Is lookin' at the mirror, wish that you were here
Growing up is—
It's a habit, know I shouldn’t be callin’
Then you let me in, is that what you wanted?
Is this what we wanted?
Now you're back in town, no, I can’t come around
Are we better without the what ifs and doubts
Is this it?
Are we both too far gone to forget
And try again?

Svarta vinbär i vår trädgård
Jag kunde höra barnen springa där på stigen

Fan va fina, ska de inte sova snart?
En puss på pannan, Kom ihåg att du är bra

Anything I give him, he deserves it
Rarely does he ever come to see me
But anytime he does, he makes it worth it
Like I earned it
God, I love him
  And when I'm with you, I can't help myself but only think about him
I can’t wait to see him again
My God, I miss him
  And when I'm with you, I'm just thinking 'bout how much I wish it was him
I can't wait to see him again
More frequent visits would've been nice
  But I don't want you knowing that there's somebody new
  Sometimes, the guilt will clog up my mind
    But is it cheating if I love a better version of you?
That he is perfect
Anything I give him, he deserves it
Rarely does he ever come to see me
But anytime he does, he makes it worth it
Like I earned it
God, I love him
  And when I'm with you, I can't help myself but only think about him
I can’t wait to see him again
My God, I miss him
  And when I'm with you, I'm just thinking 'bout how much I wish it was him
I can't wait to see him again
My God, I miss him
  And when I'm with you, I'm just thinking 'bout how much I wish it was him
I can't wait to see him again

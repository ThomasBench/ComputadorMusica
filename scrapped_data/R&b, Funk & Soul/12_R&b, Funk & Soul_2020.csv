0,929,Halsey,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/halsey/929-chords-2962607,"I really was born at 9:29 AM on 9/29
You think I'm lying but I'm, I'm  being  dead serious
Okay, I'll prove it
Well, who am I? I'm  almost 25
Can't remember half the time that I've been alive
'Cause half was in a cheap apartment
And half was on the Eastside (Eastside)
They said don't meet your heroes, they're all fuckin' weirdos
And God knows that they were right
Because nobody loves you, they just try to fuck you
Then put you on a feature on the B-Side
And who do you call when it's late at night?
When the headlines just don't paint the picture right
When you look at yourself on a screen and say
""Oh my God, there's no way that's me""
And I, I quit smoking, well recently, I tried
And I bought another house, and I never go outside
And I remember this girl with pink hair in Detroit
Well, she told me
She said, ""Ashley, you gotta promise us that you won't die
'Cause we need you,"" and honestly, I think that she lied
And I remember the names of every single kid I've met
But I forget half the people who I've gotten in bed
And I've stared at the sky in Milwaukee
And hoped that my father would finally call me
And it's just these things that I'm thinkin' for hours
And I'm pickin' my hair out in clumps in the shower
Lost the love of my life to an ivory powder
But then I realize that I'm no higher power
That I wasn't in love then, and I'm still not now
And I'm so happy I figured that out
I've got a long way to go until self-preservation
Think my moral compass is on a vacation
And I can't believe I still feed my fucking temptation
I'm still looking for my salvation
Soft and slow, watch the minutes go
Count out loud, so we know you don't keep 'em for yourself
Watch the minutes go
Count out loud, so we know you don't keep 'em for yourself
I think I have a confession to make, I feel like (So we know you don't)
I need to say that I was really born at 9:26
I saw my birth certificate, and I'm a liar
And I'm a fucking liar

Made me aware of what I was missin'
Been missin' the way you give me envision, babe
Never thought I'd settle down, reckon I lied to myself
I was busy focusin' on bein' by myself
Set my feelings to the side, they all got dusty on a shelf

   She's all mine for the night
   She's all mine until he calls her line
She pulled up to the studio
She closed the door and then she locked it
For me, for me
We had sex in the studio
Nobody walked in
I cut my verse and then she popped it
For me, for me
Oh-oh, oh-oh
   I shouldn't rush it
   Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need (bitch need)
Tryna find the one that can fix me
   I've been dodgin' death in the six speed
   Amphetamine got my stummy feelin' sickly
   Yeah, I want it all now
   I've been runnin' through the pussy, need a dog pound
   Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound
   Tryna love me but they never get a pulse down
   Why, 'cause I'm heartless
   And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
   All this money and this pain got me heartless
   Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
   Said I'm heartless
   Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
   Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
   Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
   Said I'm heartless
   So much pussy, it be fallin' out the pocket
   Metro Boomin turn this ho into a moshpit
   Tesla pill got me flyin' like a cockpit
   Yeah, I got her watchin'
   Call me up, turn that pussy to a faucet
   Duffle bags full of drugs and a rocket
   Stix drunk but he never miss a target
   Photoshoots, I'm a star now (star)
I'm talkin' Time, Rolling Stone, and Bazaar now ('zaar)
Sellin' dreams to these girls with their guard down (what?)
Seven years, I've been swimmin' with the sharks now
   Why, 'cause I'm heartless
   And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
   All this money and this pain got me heartless
   Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
   Said I'm heartless
   Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
   Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
   Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
I lost my heart and my mind
I try to always do right
I thought I lost you this time
You just came back in my life
You never gave up on me (why don't you?)
I'll never know what you see (why won't you?)
I don't do well when alone (oh yeah)
You hear it clear in my tone
   'Cause I'm heartless
   And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
   All this money and this pain got me heartless
   Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
   Said I'm heartless
   Tryna be a better man, but I'm heartless
   Never be a weddin' plan for the heartless
   Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
Light a blunt up with the flame
Put that cocaine on a plate
Molly with the purple rain
'Cause I lost my faith
So I cut away the pain, uh
Got it swimming in my veins
Now my mind is outta place, yeah, uh
'Cause I lost my faith
And I feel everything
I feel everything from my body to my soul
No, no
Well, I feel everything
When I'm coming down is the most I feel alone
No, no
I've been sober for a year, now it's time for me
To go back to my old ways, don't you cry for me
Thought I'd be a better man, but I lied to me and to you
I take half a Xan' and I still stay awake
All my demons wanna pull me to my grave
I choose Vegas if they offer heaven's gate
I tried to love, but you know I'd never stay
I'd never stay
But if I OD, I want you to OD right beside me
I want you to follow right behind me
I want you to hold me while I'm smiling
While I'm dying
And if you know me
When I go missing, you know where to find me
Driving down the boulevard is blinding
Always blinded by the desert lights and
I'm alive when
And I feel everything
I feel everything from my body to my soul
No, no
Well, I feel everything
When I'm coming down is the most I feel alone
No, no
I lost my faith
I'm losing my religion every day
Time hasn't been kind to me, I pray
When I look inside the mirror and see someone I love
Oh, someone I love
Faith
I'm losing my religion every day
Time hasn't been kind to me, I pray
When I look inside the mirror and see someone I love
I ended up in the back of a flashing car
With the city shining on my face
The lights are blinding me again
I ended up in the back of a flashing car
With the city shining on my face
The lights are blinding me again
I ended up (I ended up)
In the back of a flashing car (Back of a flashing car)
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
I look around and,   Sin City's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No I can't sleep here 'til I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh when I'm like this, you're the one I trust (hey, hey, hey)
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh-oh oh-oh oh
   The city's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No I can't sleep here 'til I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
I'm just walking by to let you know (by to let you know)
I can never say it on the phone (say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (ooh)
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No I can't sleep here 'til I feel your touch, hey, hey, hey
             Hey, hey, hey
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No I can't sleep here 'til I feel your touch
  I just pretend that I'm in the dark
I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss
I'd rather be so oblivious
I'd rather be with you
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
  I can tell what you done, yeah
In your eyes
I see there's something burning inside you
Oh, inside you
  In your eyes, I know it hurts to smile but you try to
Oh, you try to
You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes, you lie, but I don't let it define you
Oh, define you
I tried to find love
In someone else too many times
But I hope you know I mean it (Mean it)
When I tell you you're the one that was on my mind, oh
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
  I can tell what you done, yeah
In your eyes (Your eyes)
I see there's something burning inside you (Inside you)
Oh, inside you (Oh, inside you)
  In your eyes, I know it hurts to smile
but you try to (But you try to)
Oh, you try to (You try to)
You always try to hide the pain (Oh, oh)
You always know just what to say (Oh, dear)
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
  In your eyes, you lie,
but I don't let it define you (Hey)
Oh, define you
  In your eyes
I see there's something burning inside you
Oh, inside you
You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
  In your eyes, you lie,
but I don't let it define you
Oh, define you
Ooh
  I saw you dancing in a crowded room
You look so happy when I'm not with you
  But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eyes
  I don't know why I run away
  I'll make you cry when I run away
  You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
  But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care
  I don't know why I run away
  I'll make you cry when I run away
  Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
  Save your tears for another
  Save your tears for another day
   Save your tears for another day
So, I made you think that I would always stay
  I said some things that I should never say
  Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
  And now you won't love me for a second time
  I don't know why I run away
  I'll make you cry when I run away
  Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
  Save your tears for another
  I realize that I'm much too late
  And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day (Ooh, yeah)
Save your tears for another day (Yeah)
  I don't know why I run away
  I'll make you cry when I run away
Save your tears for another day, ooh girl (Ah)
I said save your tears for another day (Ah)
Save your tears for another day (Ah)
Save your tears for another day (Ah)
 You don't love him, you don't love him
 You don't love him, you're just fucking
 You don't love him, you don't love him
You don't love him if you're thinking of me
 You don't love him, you're just fucking
You're just fucking, it means nothing to me
Yeah, it's been too long, you changed up over time
Why you, why you gonna even try to hide?
It's natural to find someone to treat you right
But it ain't right if you fuck him out of spite
You don't have to cry, girl, let me wipe your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
I promise you will always be mine
Oh-oh, just repeat after me
 You don't love him, you don't love him
 You don't love him, you're just fucking
 You don't love him, you don't love him
You don't love him if you're thinking of me
 You don't love him, you're just fucking
You're just fucking, it means nothing to me
   Thought I almost died in my dream again (Baby, almost died)
   Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again
   I'm fallin' into new (Oh, oh)
   Without you goin' smooth (Fallin' in)
   'Cause my heart belongs to you
   I'll risk it all for you
   I won't just leave
   This time, I'll never leave
   I wanna share babies
   Protection, we won't need
   Your body next to me
   Is just a memory
   I'm fallin' in too deep, oh
   Without you, I'm asleep
   It's on me, only me, oh
My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself asleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
Never comin' through
I was running away from facin' reality
Wastin' all of my time on living my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
'Cause I want you, baby
I'll be livin' in Heaven when I'm inside of you
It was definitely a blessing, wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again, again
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah
   I know it's all my fault
   Made you put down your guard
   I know I made you fall
   I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (To you)
   Can't hide the truth, I stayed with her in spite of you
   You did some things that you regret, still right for you
   'Cause this house is not a home
W, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah
Without my baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
And I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, no
I can't move, I'm so paralyzed
I'm so paralyzed
And I can't explain why I'm terrified
I'm so terrified
Well, I don't wanna t ouch the sky no more
   I just wanna feel the ground when I'm coming down
    And I don't even wanna get high no more
I just want it out of my life
Out of my life, out
I wanna cut you outta my dreams
'Til I'm bleeding out
'Til I'm bleeding
I wanna cut you outta my mind now
'Til I'm bleeding out
'Til I'm bleeding
I wanna cut you outta my dreams
Woah, I'm bleeding out
Girl, I'm bleeding
I wanna cut you outta my mind
'Cause I'm bleeding out
Oh, I'm bleeding
Girl, I'm bleeding
    I keep telling myself I don't need it
    I keep telling myself I don't need it anymore
I keep telling myself I don't need it anymore

17,Rosier,Brakence,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/brakence/rosier-chords-2997905,"Now there's too many people that I have done wrong
And that I owe my thanks to for sticking along  with me
Along for me
Think I'm dreamin'
This isn't real
'Cause you leave in a month
And I'm fiending for something to feel
When you hold me
Know you, know me down to my core
This is the calm before the storm
You diverted attention away when I mentioned that someone else gon' need you more
Now there's too many people that I have done wrong
And that I owe my thanks to for sticking along  with me
Along for me
 (Oh, oh)
What we built isn't me
Won't put it back together again
I can't take back what I said
I just look through those messages
I left on read
Oh, and I took you to rosier
'Cause I thought we could cope
We got out on the ocean
I fell out my boat
And you calmed me back down
And you gave me some hope

Jeg vet jeg óg kan være en idiot i blant
Men du er alene i din liga
Blåøyd som jeg er slapp jeg ut hundene og lot de male himmelen rosa
Alt går sin gang, men du skal alltid være en helt med trusa utenpå buksa
Det var jeg som slapp hundene løs
Når himmelen sprekker opp så finnes det
  Og vi seiler et skipsvrak, like skjørt som et chipsflak
Inn i øyet av stormen
  To kniver i siden
Jeg vet ikke hvordan du har tillit til meg
Jeg bryr meg ikke, men når du sier du elsker meg
Tror jeg deg som folk tror på Gud
Angrer på at jeg prøvde å åpne meg for deg
Tror jeg hadde en episode, for jeg
Dro den altfor langt og dro deg med til helvette
Ta på meg som om ingenting er hellig
  Det ekke for tidlig for meg
  Er du lassie eller er du rex
  Du er en boks med sjokolade
  Never ever know, what you gonna get
Du ba meg forsvinne og ble sint da jeg forsvant
Jeg vet jeg óg veit godt å fucke opp en kveld
Men du er nærmest talentfull
Høyt oppe jeg fløy som Måken Jonathan
Og kjente en hånd i min mens jeg drukna
Alt går sin gang
Men du skal alltid være en helt, med trusa utenpå buksa
Du veit jeg er nødt til å få det med skje
 Da du ga meg huden full den kvelden i Bygdøy Allé
  Har du mere du vil si, så fortell
Jeg er fra trikkespor, du kan vise meg fjorder og fjell
  To sider av kniven
Jeg vet ikke hvordan du tar stilling til meg
Men når du sier du elsker meg tror jeg deg
Ikke litt, du er bare full
Du er et dødningshode
Jeg har møtt en annen, men hun går på en annen skole
Du vil ha Unge Rari, hummer og kanari
Jeg vil ha glass med digg i
Litt Astrid og litt Sigrid, den gang ei
  Lirka døra di i kollektivet, rommet lukta fortsatt salmiakk
Du kan trampe på meg tusen ganger, men jeg kommer krypende som kakkerlakker
  Mange bratte bakker, c'est la vie
  Jeg er bikkja di for alltid, det du gjør er dyreplageri

Jeg skulle gjerne hatt en hånd og holde i når jeg skal møte Elvis
En med like dårlige idéer som meg, og enda rødere kinn
En som skal dit jeg skal, som ikke har noe valg
Fy faen, det ønsker jeg meg veldig
Jeg hvisker noen ord jeg aldri kan eie
Jeg er fanget av en vind jeg er alene om å seile
Jeg er på toppen av stupetårnet, stirrer gjennom vannet
Jeg kan se helt ned til bunnen
Alle trærne var blitt nakne, nå kommer det snø snart
Det var høst i 94 og storkene fløy lavt
Og den ene av de stupte ned mot taket og bygde rede
Gidder ikke å fly til syden
Jeg har en sang til deg for hver dråpe i havet
Hver sky på himmelen, hver lighter på kommoden
Hver fake orkidee på et i hotell i resepsjonen
Det er mørkt og jeg har mista magneten til kompasset
Hvert strå på åkereren, hver grav på lunden
Hver lille pose, hver million til munnen, okay
Hvert skip på sjøen og alle vrakene på bunnen
Jeg er fanget i et hjørne av en godterikiosk i et edderkoppspinn
Jeg må finne meg en ånd i lampe før det er meg som møter Elvis
Jeg er et trappetroll som nøler på kanten av aller nederste trinn
Ville ta meg av alt, men jeg snubla og falt
Det er sykt å være så uheldig
Jeg må bestemme meg for når jeg skal forstå
Og våkne opp fra barnslig håp i rare drømmer
Der jeg stirrer inn i øyne like blå
Det er nok av skjær ute i sjøen
Det er mange toner av grå
Jeg har en sang til deg for hver dråpe i havet
Hver sky på himmelen, hver lighter på kommoden
Hver fake orkidee på et i hotell i resepsjonen
Det er mørkt og jeg har mista magneten til kompasset
Hvert strå på åkereren, hver grav på lunden
Hver lille pose, hver million til munnen, okay
Hvert skip på sjøen
Og alle vrakene på bunnen
Alltid har jeg ønsket meg en bror
Eller en søster fra min mor
Eller kanskje egentlig fra min far
En i samme båt som kan hjelpe meg å ro
Trodde aldri jeg skulle se 23
Til min kjære fetter, hvil i fred
Han ble ikke mer enn 26
Jeg vil ikke være sist av når skuta går ned, nei
Kistebunnen min er full av spenn
Og de skal jeg dele med en venn
Vi skal aldri engste oss igjen
For vi er brødre
  Så lenge det er vi to sammen
Kan det aldri blir for langt å gå hjem igjen, min venn
Ingenting blir kjedelig, er du ikke enig, baby
  Så lenge det er vi to sammen
Er det alltid flere steder enn ett som jeg kan kalle for hjem
Du kan banke på døra mi og be om en klem
Når du må ønske fordi vi er brødre
Sammen om alt
Når moren din blir borte og hennes
Så blir moren min din
Jeg lover, vi er brødre og det tar jeg ikke lett på
Noen har falt av, vi er en annen bukett nå
Men bare så du vet, meg blir du ikke kvitt for vi er brødre

 Not to mislead turn my nightmares into big dreams
 Whole squad mobbin' even though we only six deep
 I was singing notes while my niggas played with six keys
 Walking in the snow before I ever made my wrist freeze
 I was blowing smoke, had me dizzy like Gillespie
 Niggas had no homes we were living in the dead streets
 You couldn't find me like I'm Hoffa
 Cover girls jumping out the page like they pop ups
 Spending all my money on these niggas that I brought up
Taking care of families for my brothers when they locked up
 And I had nothing to believe in
Double cup leanin', couldn't even breathe and
 For that money I was fiending
Cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving
 Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving
Leaving, Leaving into the night
She like my futuristic sounds in the new spaceship
Futuristic sex give her Phillip K dick
She never need a man, she what a man need
So I keep on falling for her daily
We was at Coachella going brazy
Stack a couple M's like I was Shady
Now I'm in Tribeca like I'm Jay-Z
Rockin' Sorayama like he pay me
I just signed a new deal with Mercedes
Got me movin' dirty like I'm Swayze
All my diamonds dancing like they Swayze
All my diamonds hitting like they Swae Lee
Jet so big got a business and a coach
Always livin' on the road, rockin' Louis a la mode, nigga
 And for that money I been fiending
Cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving
 Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving
Leaving, Leaving into the night
Twenty mill' mansion, never lived in it
Zero edge pool, never dipped in it
Superstar neighbor in my business
Paparazzi tryna catch me slippin' and
Going on tour is my vacation
Every month another accusation
Only thing I'm phobic of is failing
I was never blessed with any patience

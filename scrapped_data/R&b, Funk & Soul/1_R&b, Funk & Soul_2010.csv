Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
Got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so   dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
Cause I give you all, all of me
And you give me all, all of you, oh
How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you're crying you’re beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you
My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
Cause I give you all, all of me
And you give me all, all of you, oh

We're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard

Love your curves and all your edges

1,Love Yourself,Justin Bieber,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/justin-bieber/love-yourself-chords-1780199,"For all the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying, on my own, well I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself

Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I'd hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
That for me it isn't o - ver
  Never mind, I'll find someone like you - ou
I wish nothing but the best for you two
Don't forget me, I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instea - ead
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instea - ead

Only    yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a      summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

Go ahead and sell me out, and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless

We could have had it all... (You're gonna wish you, never had met me)...
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart... (you're gonna wish you)... Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
And you played it... (Tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (Rolling in the deep)

But I've heard one on you. Now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Fifteen  flares inside those ocean eyes
Your ocean eyes

You really know how to make me cry

I've never fallen from quite this high

I've been  walking through a world gone  blind

Careful   creature made friends with  time
He left her   lonely with a diamond mind

go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely

we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb
and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure
Once I was eleven years old
my daddy told me
go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was eleven years old
I always have that dream
like my Daddy before me
I started writing stories
Something about that glory
just always seemed to bore me
will ever really know me
Once I was twenty years old
my story got told
before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was twenty years old
  I only see my goals
I don't believe in failure
they can make it major
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
I hope I see you later
Once I was twenty years old
my story got told
I saw before me
Once I was twenty years old
Soon we´ll be 30 years old
our songs have been sold
and we´re still roaming
Soon we´ll be 30 years old
I´m still learning about life
my woman brought children for me
and I can tell them stories
  Most of my boys are with me
some are still out seeking glory
my brother, I´m still sorry
Soon I´ll be sixty years old
my daddy got sixty-one
remember life and then your life
  I made a man so happy
when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit

will I think the world is cold

There is no tomorrow

Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I  can use
Take me by the hand
while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?
I don't need

It's already in your eyes
and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
and since you're the only one that matters
tell me, who do I run to?
Now, don't get me wrong, I know
There is no tomorrow
All I ask is
If this is my last night with  you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I  can use
Take me by the hand
while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?
Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way  we remember us
I don't want to be cruel or       vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand
while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never lo...ve   again

without falling to your feet
But there's a side to you that I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say, they were never true, never true
And the games you'd play, you would always win, always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, your name
When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

Feel the Earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away I'm stolen

We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together

A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

And face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together

What you see I see
I know I'll never be me without the security
of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together

If you wanna go then I'll be so lonely

 And I know we haven't talked in a while
 So I'm looking for an open door

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet, to go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal you, but I ain't done much healing.
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be when we were younger and free.
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet.
There's such a difference between us
and a million miles.
Hello from the other side,
I must've called a thousand times to tell you
I'm sorry, for everything that I've done,
But when I call you never seem to be home.
Hello from the outside,
At least I can say that I've tried to tell you
I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore.
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
are running out of time.
So, hello from the other side,
I must've called a thousand times to tell you
I'm sorry, for everything that I've done,
But when I call you never seem to be home.
Hello from the outside,
At least I can say that I've tried to tell you
I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore.

Anymore oh         ooooohh
Anymore ohhhh        anymore

She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the Heavens ever did speak
She is the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
'We were born sick,' you heard them say it
        My church offers no absolutes
She tells me 'worship in the bedroom'
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
     Command me to be well
Aaaaaaaaaaamen. Amen. Amen
     Take me to church, I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life                [Chorus](2x)
       If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
To drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work     
Take me to church, I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies

Offer me that deathless death

There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human, only then I am clean.

fall apart twice a day
i just wish you could feel what you say
show, never tell
but i know you too well
kind of mood that you wish you could sell
if teardrops could be bottled
there'd be swimming pools filled by models
told ""a tight dress is what makes you a whore""
if ""i love you"" was a promise
would you break it, if you're honest?
tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
i don't wanna be you...
anymore
hands getting cold
losing feeling's getting old
was i made from a broken mold?
hurt, i can't shake
we've made every mistake
only you know the way that i break
if teardrops could be bottled
there'd be swimming pools filled by models
told ""a tight dress is what makes you a whore""
if ""i love you"" was a promise
would you break it, if you're honest?
tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
i don't wanna be you
i don't wanna be you
i don't wanna be you...

Baby blue, just like we rehearsed
When I get up off this ground, I shake leaves back down
To the brown, brown, brown, brown
'Til I'm clean
    Then I walk where I'd be shaded by the trees
For about a mile
I'm headed to town, town, town
In style
With all my favorite colors, yes, sir
All my favorite colors, right on
My sisters and my brothers
See 'em like no other
All my favorite colors
It's a good day (To be)
My favorite colors, colors
My sisters and my brothers (My sisters and my brothers)
They see 'em like no other (See 'em like no other)
All my favorite colors
Now take me to the other side
Little bitty blues bird flies
And gray clouds, or white walls, or blue skies
We gon' fly, feel alright
And we gon'
It sound like
The least I can say, I anticipate
A homecoming parade as we renegade
In the morning, right on
With all my favorite colors (All my favorite colors) yes, sir
All my favorite colors (All my favorite colors) yes, ma'am
My sisters and my brothers (My sisters and my brothers)
See 'em like no other (See 'em like no other)
All my favorite colors (All my favorite colors)
All my favorite colors (All my favorite colors)
All my favorite colors (All my favorite colors) yes, ma'am
My sisters and my brothers (My sisters and my brothers)
See 'em like no other (See 'em like no other)
All my favorite colors (All my favorite colors)
It's a good day to be (A good day to be)
A good day to see my favorite colors (A good day to see my favorite colors)

They see 'em like no other

Right there, right next to you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain, the way I'm missing you
You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feelings overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you 
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy
You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feelings overwhelming, it's much too strong
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
And I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight
Lay me down tonight
lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight
lay me by your side
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you

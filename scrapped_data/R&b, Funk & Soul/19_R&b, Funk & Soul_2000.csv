0,Pda We Just Dont Care (ver 2),John Legend,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-legend/pda-we-just-dont-care-chords-903484,"Let's go to the park
I wanna kiss you underneath the stars
Maybe we'll go too far
We just don't care
We just don't care
We just don't care
You know I love you when you're loving me
Sometimes it's better when it's publicly
I'm not ashamed, I don't care who sees
Us hugging & kissing our love exhibition all
We'll rendezvous out on the fire escape
I'd like to set off an alarm today
The love emergency don't make me wait
Just follow I'll lead you
I urgently need you
Let's go to the park
I wanna kiss you underneath the stars
Maybe we'll go too far
We just don't care
We just don't care
We just don't
Let's make love, 
let's go somewhere they might discover us
Let's get lost in lust
We just don't care,
We just don't care,
We just don't care.
I see you closing down the restaurant
Let's sneak and do it when your boss is gone
Everybody's leaving we'll have some fun
Or maybe it's wrong but you're turning me on.
Ooh, we'll take a visit to your Mama's house
Creep to the bedroom while your Mama's out
Maybe she'll hear it when we scream and shout
And we'll keep it rocking until she comes knocking
Let's go to the park
I wanna kiss you underneath the stars
Maybe we'll go too far
We just don't care,
We just don't care,
We just don't...
Let's make love,
Let's go somewhere they might discover us.
Let's get lost in lust
We just don't care,
We just don't care,
We just don't care.
If we keep up on this fooling around
We'll be the talk of the town
I'll tell the world I'm in love any time
Let's open up the blinds 'cause we really don't mind
Ooh I don't care about the propriety
Let's break the rules and ignore society
Maybe our neighbors like to spy, it's true
So what if they watch when we do what we do
Let's go to the park
I wanna kiss you underneath the stars
Maybe we'll go too far
We just don't care,
We just don't care,
We just don't...
Let's make love,
Let's go somewhere they might discover us........

Go gangsta, keep boppin' (Block Boy up!)
Rock with me, let's get this bitch poppin' (Upfront!)
Go gangsta, keep boppin' (Geah!)
Like back when a n*gga was clockin'
See, nowadays it seems like e'rybody wanna be killas
Gorillas getting high off their weed and liquor
You die quicker, paramedics drive back slow to the hospital
You get pronounced dead at 4, to the hospital
Stop frontin' when you know you won't pull nothin'
First n*gga to retreat when the tools bustin'
Playing with death is bad for your health
All your homeboys gone, you the last one left
Now, they hearts beatin', but these niggas be scared
The real ones are all locked up or dead
Nowadays you can't find a good connect
But if you do, you might be the feds, so...
I don't know you, you don't know me
You don't know the history I got on these streets
Only if you see what my eyes have seen
Then you'll understand why I'm surrounded by G's
If you owe me, and we got beef
I recommend you reach for your heat and don't freeze
Pause for a minute, guaranteed you gon' bleed
'Cause that's how we was raised growing up in these streets
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Rock with me, let's get this bitch poppin'
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Like back when a nigga was clockin'
See, it's hard to be good, but easy to do evil
And I ain't really into meeting with new people
Just put the money in the bag and I'll leave you
The weed, coke, Lambo or Evisu
You make a hundred dollars, to the streets you made a G
When you coppin' O's, they swearing you move ki's
Feds getting close and the rats seeing cheese
And they tryin' to find them birds
Not the ones that sleep in trees
We got that bird, we got that blue
You want short skirts? We got that too
Whatever you need, my nigga, show me the cheese
And baby, you can believe that we can make that brew
I don't know you, you don't know me

Rock with me, let's get this bitch poppin'
Go gangsta, keep boppin'

Streets been watchin' and they don't blink
Sidewalk got ears, the pavement don't sleep
The fittest will survive, the weak just don't eat
E'rybody in between just gettin' a rap sheet

And there's no one to hold on to
And there's no one to pull you out

And no one can here you callin'
So you end up self-destructin'

The passion and love you were feeling 
And so you left 
For someone new

Ooh, sing out loud, through whispers

Byłaś serca biciem,    wiosną, zimą, życiem,
Marzeń moich echem,    winem, wiatrem, śmiechem.
Ostatnio w mieście mym tramwaje po północy błądzą,
Rozkładem nocnych tras piekielne jakieś moce żądzą,
Nie wiedzieć czemu, wciąż rozkłady jazdy tak zmieniają,
Że prawie każdy tramwaj pod twym oknem nocą staje.
Byłaś serca biciem,    wiosną, zimą, życiem,
Marzeń moich echem,    winem, wiatrem, śmiechem.
Ostatnio słońca mniej, ostatnio noce bardziej ciemne,
Już nawet księżyc drań o tobie nie chce gadać ze mną,
W kieszeni grosze dwa, w kieszeni na dwa szczęścia grosze,
W tym jednak losu żart, że ja obydwa grosze noszę.
Byłaś serca biciem,    wiosną, zimą, życiem,
Marzeń moich echem,    winem, wiatrem, śmiechem.
Ktoś pytał jak się masz, jak się czujesz,
Ktoś, z kim rok w wojnę grasz, wyczeku-----je.
Ktoś, kto nocami, ulicami, tramwajami
Pod twe okno mknie, gdzie spotyka mnie.

I'm sorry if I hurt you

But we're lost without you here
I cooled the hot dishwater

It's wintertime already
Christmas will be here soon
It'll be a sad, sad occasion
If you're not in the dining room
I hate to do the dishes
And I know the reason why
Putting on your apron
Makes me want to cry
To keep our home together
I done the best I could
Your true reason for leaving
Honey, I never understood
I still love you my darlin'
But the children want you here

Oh she sang night and day
To those fast fading stars in old broken down bars
That were full yesterday
Now they've cleared all the tables away
Where are those sad sad songs
I don't here those sad sad songs
She took her last bow, sang her last song,
Can't hear her now. Can't hear her now,
Suzy's gone

Of the lonely old men, she sang only to them
As she found her spotlight of fame
If only they'd remember her name

In exchange for everything you give to me
Read my mind and make me feel just fine
When I think my peace of mind is out of reach
      The scales are sometimes unbal- anced
And you bear the weight of all that has to be
I hope you see that you can lean on me
And together we can calm a stormy sea
     We love so strong and so unselfishly
     And I tell you now    that I made a vow; I'm
Giving you the best that I got,  baby
     Yes I tell you now, that I made a vow; I'm
Giving you the best that I got, honey
      Everybody's got o-pinions
About the way they think our story's gonna end
Some folks feel it's just a superficial thrill
Everybody's gonna have to think again
     We love so strong and so unselfishly
   They don't bother me      so I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got,  baby
   They don't bother me      said I'm gonna keep on
Giving you the best that I got, listen baby
Somebody understands you
Somebody gave his heart to me
I stumbled my whole life long, always
On my own, now I'm home
      My weary mind is rested
And I feel as if my home is in your arms
Fears are all gone, I like the sound of your song
And I think I want to sing it forever
     We love so strong and so unselfishly
     And I made a vow      so I tell you now; I'm

 No school to-morrow and no love from Mama

 Go get my daddy and bring him back home

 My sisters are too small and they cannot help us
 We've all tried prayin' but I don't know how to pray
 We are the lost ones seekin' help today
 I'd call the neighbors but I don't even know their names
 They've lived there ten years oh ain't that a shame
 Don't think they'd help us even if I asked them to

The boat along the side sails to carry us away
Islands on the river

It could happen soon, but just like yesterday
The ships have come and gone and we were not along.

45,Red Scar Eyes,Mitch Ryder,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/mitch-ryder/red-scar-eyes-chords-3093353,"I’m sitting cross the table    From the gambler with the red scar eyes
Not saying nothing    checking Out each others site
He's not too bad once shit    Just filled his shoes
I'm sitting cross the table and drinking of this bad mans news
I'm sitting cross the table from the Man  that broke my wife
Get her high made her crazy cut   her Heart out with a knife
Love to rip his head off    keep  It in a jar
He's just across the table an' I Might not wait that far
I'm a star             I'm a star
I'm sitting in a bar crying into an empty glass
Gimme more make it pour   Burn my soul Just don't let night pass
I wasn't born happy never could Stand in the sun
I broke down my woman   that's the worst Thing I've ever done
I'm sitting at a table with the man That broke my wife
Get her high made her cry  Cut her heart out with a knife
Love to rip his head off an keep it In a jar
He's chatting at his table   but I might not go that far
I'm a star     I'm a star

46,On My Own,Patti LaBelle,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/patti-labelle/on-my-own-chords-3130361,"So many times
Said it was forever
Said our love would always be true
Something in my heart always knew
I'd be lying here beside you
On    my  own
On my own
On my own
So many promises
never should be spoken
Now I know what loving you cost
Now we're up to talking divorce
And we weren't even married
On    my  own
Once again now
One more time
By myself
No one said it was easy
But it once was so easy
Well I believed in love
Now here I stand
I wonder why
I'm on    my  own (Why did it end this way)
On my own (This wasn't how it was supposed to be)
On my own (I wish that we could do it all again)
So many times
I know I should have told you
Losing you it cut like a knife
You walked out and there went my life
I don't want to live without you
On my own (This wasn't how it was supposed to end)
On my own (I wish that we could do it all again)
On my own (I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone)
On my own
On my own (I've got to find where I belong again)
On my own (I've got to learn how to be strong again)
On my own (I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone)
On my own (By myself by myself)
On my own (I've got to find out what was mine again)
On my own (My heart is saying that it's my time again)
On my own (And I have faith that I will shine again)
On my own (I have faith in me)
On my own
On my own
On my own

Jackie Wilson said it was reet petite, I kind of love you, Yes it knocks me off my feet
Let it all come down, Let it all come down, and you know I am so wired up
dont need no tea in my cup, Let it all come down, Let it all come down Now watch this
Toodle langa langa toodle langa lang Toodle langa langa toodle langa lang ohhh
I'm in heaven, I'm in hea-ven, I'm in heaven, when you smile when you smile when you smile when you smile
And when you walk, across that street, you make my heart go, Boom, boom, boom,
and everytime I, I stop to think about it, Well child it simply makes my day
Let it all come down, oh Let it all come down,
Toodle langa langa toodle langa fang Toodle langa langa toodle langa fang (I'm in heaven)
Toodle langa langa toodle langa fang Toodle langa langa toodle langa fang (I'm in heaven)

I'm in heaven, I'm in hea-ven, I'm in heaven, when you smile when you smile

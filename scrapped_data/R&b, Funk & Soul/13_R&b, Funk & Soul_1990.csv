I've made my mistakes
wake up let's not, break up
Thrill me, you've got a love so strong
Thrill me, you really turn me on
Thrill me, wait till tomorrow night
Thrill, me  I'm gonna treat you right
You said that I would never let you be alone
How many times have you been on your own
Worked all the days to find the things you try to do
If only my heart will never let you through
Because you
Thrill me, you've got a love so strong
Thrill me, you just can’t do me wrong
Thrill me, wait till tomorrow night
Thrill, me  I'm gonna treat you right
Feels so good
Your hands feel like silk down my back
Come on, come on
          Oh Yeah!
        Feel it, baby
The truth is you've gone and left me on my own
How can I face the fact you're really gone
Love was a phase we'd have to pray to make it true
If only my heart would've never let you through
Because you
Thrill me, you've got a love so strong
Thrill me, you really turn me on
Thrill me, wait till tomorrow night
Thrill, me  I'm gonna treat you right
          Oh Yeah!

But they say it's fair game
And they won't feel no pain
As we feel no shame
So let the sun come down
Let our eyes close the blind
Let the rivers run dry
Let the forest life die
But who are they to decide
As if their right is divine
As if their right sublime
Who wins the hooves loses respect
Who kills the Grace treads with intent -
Into Heaven's domain,
playing little Christians
Hear their voice soar in church
Giving thanks for this earth -
Then destroying its birth
So let the sun come down
Let our eyes close the blind
Let the rivers run dry
Let the forest life die
But who are they to decide
As if their right is divine
As if their right sublime

Hah, DJ,
Get yourself some Oprah cash.
Uh, baby,
Do you really think you’ve got it so hard? Huh?
Do you think it might do you some good to look around you
And decide how you might feel
If the pain you felt was real? Oh, baby,
Bad, bad boy.
Is that why you’re here?
Now nothing comes for nothing, baby,
That fame and fortune’s heaven sent, baby.
And who gives a fuck about your problems, darling,
‘Cause you can pay the rent.
You can pay. (Is that what makes a star?)
Pay.

And as your body moves with mine
It's like I'm lifted out of time
And time again
Patientiy I've waited
For this moment to arrive
After tonight
Will you remember
How sweet and tenderly
You reached for me
After you go
Will you return to love me
After tonight begins to fade
I feel your touch caressing me
This feeling's all I'll ever need
With every kiss from your sweet lips
It's like I'm drifting out of time
Alone will tell
If you feel the way I feel
When I look in your eyes

Ever been a perfect family
I've always longed for undividedness
And sought stability
A flower taught me how to pray
But as I grew, that flower changed
She started flailing in the wind
Like golden petals scattering
And I miss you dandelion
And even love you
And I wish there was a way
For me to trust you
But it hurts me every time
I try to touch you
But I miss you dandelion
And even love you
I gravitated towards a patriarch
So young predictably
I was resigned to spend my life
With a maze of misery
A boy and a girl befriended me
We bonded through despondency
I stayed so long but finally
I fled to save my sanity
And I miss you little sis and
Little brother
And I hope you realize
L'll always love you
And although you're struggling
You will recover
And I miss you little sis and
Little brother
So many I considered
Closest to me
Turned on a dime and sold me
Out dutifully
Although that knife was chipping
Away at me
They turned their eyes away and
Went home to sleep ...
And I missed a lot of life
But l'II recover
Though I know you really like
To see me suffer
Still I wish that you and I'd
Forgive each other
'Cause I miss you, Valentine
And really loved you
I really loved you -
I tried so hard
But you drove me away
To preserve my sanity -
And I found the strength to break away
Fly...
I know 
there is a rainbow
For me to follow 
To get beyond my sorrow
Thunder precedes the sunlight
so I'll be alright
If I can find that rainbow's end
I will be alright if I can find that rainbow's

salutarci come due vecchi amici
'ehi, ciao come stai?'
quando un giorno di notte
m'hai detto: 'non ti lascerò mai'
quando un giorno di notte
t'ho detto: 'non ti lascerò mai'
E adesso siamo occhi negli occhi
e non serve a niente parlare
ho la mappa di tutti i tuoi nei
io la potrei disegnare
Nei tuoi occhi ritrovo i miei giorni
di qualche anno fa
le domeniche senza far niente
e voglia di sincerità
Parliamo un po'
raccontami quello che fai
sei la stessa che un giorno
m'ha detto: 'non ti lascerò mai'
quando un giorno di notte
m'hai detto: 'non ti lascerò mai'
quando un giorno di notte
t'ho detto: 'non ti lascerò mai'
Io ti cercherò
negli occhi delle donne
che nel mondo incontrerò
e dentro quegli sguardi
mi ricorderò di noi
chissà se si chiamava amore
Nei tuoi occhi mi trovo nell'attimo
prima in cui sto per baciarti
l'universo si ferma un istante
perché vuole ammirarti
tutto il resto mi passa alle mani
come la sabbia del mare
resta solo un diamante che brilla
e continua a brillare.
Ogni volta che mi torni in mente
continua a brillare
in un angolo della mia mente
ti continuo ad amare
Io ti cercherò
negli occhi delle donne
che nel mondo incontrerò
e dentro quegli sguardi
mi ricorderò di noi
chissà se si chiamava amore

Your phrases, descriptive
And through the textured words
With beauty, you post it
And use such colored verbs
So tell me, you think that maybe we've gone insane?
To find a, a lover and through the words of pain

And          lives are         broken
       Time to move          on 
     Crossing that       bridge 
With lessons I've      learned
Playing with     fire 
And not getting       burned
     I may not       know what you're going       through
But time is the     space 
Between me and     you
I just don't             know what's got into             me 
      Crossing that       bridge 
With lessons I've       learned
Playing with     fire 
And not getting      burned
     I may not       know what you're going       through
When time is the     space 
Between me and       you
There is a       light through that win -       dow
Hold on say     yes 
While people say     no
Oooh –          hooow 
Ooohooo –           hooo 
      I’m crossing that       bridge 
With lessons I've       learned   
     I’m playing with       fire 
And not getting       burned   
     I may not       know what you're going       through
But time is the      space 
Between me and       you
There is a      light, through that win -       dow
Hold on say     yes 
While people say         no
Woohoo          woohoo 
It carries         on 
When nothing else         matters 
Nothing else         matters 
I just don't         know what's got into me
We need a prayer for the           dying

48,A Moment With You,George Michael,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/george-michael/a-moment-with-you-chords-987373,"   [Intro] (cant keep holding it in when its something good)
Hey, this wont take much time, we wont touch
We'll just wait for signs, and nothing was further from my mind
Than this moment with you.
But if you'd only told me baby, i would have made some other plans
If i'd only seen it sooner, but what a way with your hands               you had
I wanted that moment with you
I know that its wrong
But ""if you need me i'm here"" turns me on
I cant help thinking its a miracle your here
I cant help thinking its a miracle
I cant help thinking its a miracle your here
I cant help thinking its a miracle
I cant help thinking its a miracle
I cant help thinking its a miracle
I cant help thinking its a miracle your here

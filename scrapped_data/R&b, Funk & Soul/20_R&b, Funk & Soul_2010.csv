0,Best Mistake (ver 2),Ariana Grande,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ariana-grande/best-mistake-chords-1510987,"How soon do we forget how we felt
Dealing with emotions that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game
Maybe I'm the sinner, and not a saint
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers anyway? We're all the same
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds?
And stop acting like we're blind
Cause if the water dries up
And the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind boy
You know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on
I guess times wasting, tick-tocking lip locking
How can we keep the feelings fresh how do we zip lock them
Wear your heart up on your sleeves so watch for pickpockets
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up, hold love, I know love can be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten lost my temper and went back to four
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out started a family tree
And I feel like everything we do is overdue
You asked why I love your mom so much 'cause she's an older you
I wish you were happy I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos we both ones and ones the oddest
Couple only human except you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest
When you start as friends it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one then I'm the best mistake you ever had
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds?
And stop acting like we're blind
Cause if the water dries up
And the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind boy
You know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, hold on
You're, you're, you're you're, mmm
I be savin' my love for you, for you
You're, you're, you're you're, mmm
I be savin' my love for you, for you

And travels in circles, through hoops over hurdles
Everyone's careless, they talk about our mess
They don't care how it hurts me, must think it was easy
They say you have a new love, I'm happy for you, love
I just don't wanna meet her, are you gonna keep her?
Cause I don't wanna see you with her, I don't wanna see her face
Resting in your embrace, her feet standing in my place
I don't wanna see you moved on, I don't think I'm that strong

I don't like being sober, that's when it hits me it's over

Saying you found one, that makes you feel as strong
And helps you through hard times, cause that job was once mine

Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains

What if the sky and the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter

I didn’t wanna get her involved

Hopped into my car; drove far
Far’s too close and I remember
My memories no sharp

I’m building y’all a clock, stop

That would probably intimidate

22,Life Is Worth Living,Justin Bieber,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/justin-bieber/life-is-worth-living-chords-1780726,"  Ended up on a crossroad
Try to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
  You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Who'll show you grace?
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
With a long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
 Life is worth living again
  Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
  Feels like a blizzard in April
Cause my heart is just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent us an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
 Life is worth living again
 Life is worth living again
 What I'd give for my affection
Is a different perception
From what the world may see
They try to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
  Life is worth living again
Another day
Life is worth living again

Just music and just with the one
I’m fine like that, fine like that, fine
I never be losin’, I’ve won every time
No, you know knows me no better like that
Fittin’ in, your styling out too quickly
Man it’s in the way you do when you move so swiftly
Vibin’ out to you make me too human
Smokin’ out the way I feel emotion
It’s so good it’s so bad, it’s so bad it’s so new
Wishin’ at the end of June
Clouds in my shroud in my vision grow clearly
Can’t see ahead if I’m fine when I be leavin' me
What is the sayin’ when you let go
What is so impossible though?
Do me like that with a smile, with a smack
With all your nose you know better like that
When we be on the scene when ya gottem
Wingin’ me weather
No rainy, no windy, no sun
Just music and just with the one
I’m fine like, that fine like that, fine
I never be losin’, I've won every time
No it’s
Up from above it don’t leave me behind
It’s around all the Earth, and we know it’s divine, yes
When I’ll be emptyin’ all of my mind, i see

I'm building this house on the moon
Like a lost astronaut
Looking at you like a star
From a place the world forgot
And there's nothing
That I can do
Except bury my love for you
The brightness of the sun
Will give me just enough
To bury my love
In the moondust
I long to hear your voice
But still i made the choice
To bury my love
In the moondust
Nothing can breath
In the space
Colder than
The darkest sea
I have dreams
About the days
Driving through
Your sunset breeze
And the first thing
That I will do
Is bury my love for you
The brightness of the sun
Will give me just enough
To bury my love
In the moondust
I long to hear your voice
But still i made the choice
To bury my love
In the moondust
I'm a castaway
Men reap what they sow
And I say what I know
To be true
I'm living far away
On the face of the moon
I buried my love to give the world to you
The brightness of the sun
Will give me just enough
To bury my love
In the moondust
I long to hear your voice
But still i made the choice
To bury my love
In the moondust

Call it destiny

Might not have always been a fairy tale
But you know and I know
I'll take the truth over the story
But I'm not about to let us fail
I'll be the wind picking up your sail
But won't you do something for me?
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be

Oh, tangled and messy

I'd rather be anywhere but here
But my uncle's here to open the door and I don't like him
I felt so uncomfortable, I left
So it's just me and my mistakes
      And I'd like to know that you smile when you're alone
And when you need time to yourself
Remember me, I won't be anyone else
I'm just the boy you love
When I heard that you don't know why you're here
And became one with the ground
     And my lover's best friend
No, he doesn't know what to suggest
But when his ""everything"" just isn't enough
     He'd like to know that you smile when you're alone, (mh mh)
And when you need time to yourself, (mh mh)
Remember me, I won't be anyone else
I'm just the boy you love
And if it looks like you don't love me then
That's alright and I would let you be content
I'm still your friend
No revenge and no regrets
No regrets, no regrets
And if it looks like God might judge me
Then I don't even wanna stay another day
Cause if he's the one, then who am I?
He calls the shots
And he always decides
What's the point in living life
Living life... when it's all for him...

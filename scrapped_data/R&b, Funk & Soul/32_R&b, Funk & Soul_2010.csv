You're just plain mean to me woman and that's a crying, crying shame
Since you gone away and left me honey, I've been crying with the pain
I'd do most anything to feel your love just once again
I'd do most anything to feel your love just once again
But that day never comes babe, that's why I'm crying with the pain
You're just like a little child babe, and you treat love just like a game
Yeah you're just like a little child babe and you treat love just like your own game
But you never really loved me honey, that's why I'm crying with pain
Yeah I'm crying with the pain most every night and every day
Yeah I'm crying, crying, crying most every night and every day
It was just three words I wanna hear from you baby, but those are three words that you never say

1,Need Somebody To Love,Ady Suleiman,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ady-suleiman/need-somebody-to-love-chords-2801555,"Girl where are you?
What's the colour of your skin and
What dress will you be wearing when
I first meet you?
The scent of your perfume
The sound of your vocal (oh)
Will I ever find you?
I dream and I hope to hold you and touch you girl
But I won't stop searching
I will swim across these oceans to deal with these emotions
Love, Love, lala lala I (x2)
And you're the one I'm looking for, living for
You're the one I'm thinking of you're the one that I will love
I wonder if our paths have crossed in this world
I wonder where you are, enough
I wonder if you've heard this verse
I wonder what your body looks like
Will you look sublime, words I can't describe?
And I don't know what Cupid is waiting for, I just want him to draw back his bow and fire
Cause I've been waiting for so long
To give someone my attention
Someone to love, no no, no no no oh
So where are you?
Because I need somebody to love
Let me care for you
Because I need somebody to love
Where are you?
I need somebody to love
I need somebody to love
And I ain't got a metaphor for this cause
I don't know what's big enough to describe this feeling of questing far and near
But still you don't appear
So it's like, ""love what happened here?""
Oh I'm waiting for you, dear
Cause I've been waiting for so long
To give someone my attention
Someone to love, no no, no no no oh
So where are you?
Because I need somebody to love
Let me care for you
Because I need somebody to love
Where are you?
I need somebody in this world to love, love, love
So where are you?
Because I need somebody to love
Let me care for you
Because I need somebody to love
So where are you?
Because I need somebody to love
I need somebody to love
I just want somebody to love
(to love to love to love)
I just want somebody to love
(to love to love to love)
And now I'm talking to you
I don't even know where you are or when you're coming through
All I know is I love you and proof of that, this song is written
If you're out there girl, I really hope you're listening
I'm still wishing for the day I find you girl, you're here to stay
I'll look back at this verse and say, ""Thank fuck, finally""
Now I'm sitting with you listening to this fucking mission
Until then I'll keep on singing to this song is all diminished so
I just want somebody to love
(to love to love to love)
I just want somebody to love
(to love to love to love)
I just want somebody to love
(to love to love to love)
I just want somebody to love
(to love to love to love)
Girl where are you?
What's the colour of your skin and
What dress will you be wearing when
I first meet you?
Cause I can't wait to find you
So my life can begin

3,October,Alessia Cara,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/alessia-cara/october-chords-2814290,"5AM the moon went to sleep
Your friend speaking in tongues in the back seat
Just one little glance, I know what you mean somehow
We're stealing moments, moments away
Why are we just not as good in the day?
Is it too soon to know if it's too soon to say for now?
The bubble we're living in
Setting me free again
I don't know what it is about this
I'm gonna miss it when it's over
I hope we never see October
I felt the weight fall off my shoulders
I'm gonna miss this when it's
I'm gonna miss you when it's done
I can't feel my hands, you laugh like you do
It happened like that according to you
It's only a month, but doesn't feel new somehow
The bubble we're living in
Setting me free again
I don't know what it is about this
I'm gonna miss it when it's over
I hope we never see October
I felt the weight fall off my shoulders
I'm gonna miss this when it's
I'm gonna miss
I'm gonna miss it when it's over
I hope we never see October
I felt the weight fall off my shoulders
I'm gonna miss this
I'm gonna miss you when it's done
Paint a picture in my brain, encapsulate the fleeting feeling
It ricochets, replace my pain 'til every trace is leaving
The nerve of autumn time days flying by, every sunrise healing me
And we're okay, we'll live this way 'til it's done
I'm gonna miss it when it's over
I hope we never see October
I felt the weight fall off my shoulders
I'm gonna miss this when it's

I hope we never see October

Counting trees as they pass me by

And she's got her hand down his pants

If you call and say that you need me
I’ll be comin’ home, I’ll be comin’ home, yeah
You taught me how to never lose hope and
You told me that your door’s always open
So I’ll be comin’ home, I’ll be comin’ home
Hey there Papa, I wish I knew where you been
We talked two months ago and I ain't heard from you since
I'm not gonna lie I was a little messed up from the last text you sent
But thank God for Mama, yeah, she taught me how to forgive
So it don’t matter where life leads me
If you call and say that you need me
I’ll be comin’ home, I’ll be comin’ home (Oh yeah)
We’re broken but I’ll never lose hope and
I promise that my door’s always open
If you’re comin’ home, if you’re comin’ home
Yeah, project livin' (yeah)
Late nights in Linden park chillin' (Uh huh)
Jean's crib with Randy, Rob, and Ruben (Yeah)
Mama Frida’s pork chops got us feelin’ (Mm)
(So good)
Took some shit for granted
Didn’t always have much we managed
To all of my family, and all of the homies
Who taught me what home is
I want you to know this
It don’t matter where life leads me (No, no)
If you call and say that you need me
I’ll be comin’ home, I’ll be comin’ home (Oh-oh, yeah)
You taught me how to never lose hope and
You love me with your arms wide open
So I’ll be comin’ home, I’ll be comin’ home (Yeah)
Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm, mm-mm (Yeah)
You taught me how to never lose hope and
I love you with my arms wide open
I’ll be comin’ home, I’ll be comin’ home, yeah

We’ll go our separate ways
We don’t need to dig our own gravestones
Push each other out till we’re alone
These fights are taking on the same tone
Oh it’s worse if I stay
Cuz you changed my personality
I’ll close the door behind me, 
I oh I

To someone who won’t do me wrong

The villain you are with me
Release your hold
And I’m the one in control

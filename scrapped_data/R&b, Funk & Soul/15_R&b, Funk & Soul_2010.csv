On the other side of town
I don't wanna keep her waiting
(I don't wanna keep her waiting, waiting)
She's got me upside   tongue-tied
Twisted all around
I don't wanna keep her waiting
(I don't wanna keep her waiting, waiting)
Well, I don't know
Or just come and go?
And my feet feel cold
And my heart remains
Oh, she's got everything you want
And all my friends adore her
She wonders how my day went
Well, I don't wanna keep my baby waiting
I've got a brown eyed   lover
On the other side of town
I don't wanna keep her waiting
(I don't  wanna keep her waiting, waiting)
She's got me upside   tongue-tied
Twisted all around
I don't wanna keep her waiting
(I don't wanna keep her waiting, waiting)
Oh, let me think
Who's got so much more time
That don't make sense
Just to run away?
Oh, she's got everything you want
And all my friends adore her
She wishes I'd stop worrying
Well, I don't wanna keep my baby waiting!
I've got a brown eyed  lover
On the other side of town
I don't wanna keep her waiting
(I don't   wanna keep her waiting, waiting)
She's got me upside   tongue-tied
Twisted all around
I don't wanna keep her waiting
(I don't   wanna keep her waiting, waiting)
I've got a brown eyed   lover
On the other side of town
I don't wanna keep her waiting, ye

1,To Noise Making Sing,Hozier,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/hozier/to-noise-making-sing-chords-2620626,"Remember when you'd sing
Just for the fuck of it?
Any joy it would bring
Honey, the look of it
Was as sweet as the sound
Your head tilt back, your funny mouth to the clouds
I couldn't hope to know that song and all its words
Wouldn't claim to feel the same it felt the first time it was heard
I couldn't name that feeling carried in that voice
Was it that or just the act of making noise that brought you joy?
You don't have to sing it right
Who could call you wrong?
You put your emptiness to melody
Your awful heart to song
You don't have to sing it nice, but honey sing it strong
At best, you'll find a little remedy
At worst, the world will sing along
So honey, sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Remember when you'd sing
Before we moved to it?
And we'd scuff up our shoes
Honey, the groove of it
Was whatever you choose
I want to be your lover
Or the fisherman's blues
You don't have to sing it right
Who could call you wrong?
You put your emptiness to melody
Your awful heart to song
You don't have to sing it nice, but honey sing it strong
At best, you'll find a little remedy
At worst, the world will sing along
So honey, sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Who could ask to be unbroken or be brave again
Or, honey, hope even on this side of the grave again?
And who could ask you to be sound or to feel saved again
Or stick around until you hear that music play again?
So honey, sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Remember when you'd sing
Just for the love of it?
Any joy it would bring

Do you, don’t you, would you even stay if you did?

It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?
I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters
Tell me who do I run to?
Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
Cause what if I never love again?
Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is
If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
What if I never love again?

Once I was seven years old
It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure
Once I was eleven years old my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was eleven years old
I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
Cause only those I really love will ever really know me
Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was 20 years old
I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing about everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old
Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be 30 years old
I'm still learning about life
So I can sing them all my songs
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Soon I'll be 60 years old
Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Soon I'll be 60 years old

When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til three thousand and five, hol' up
Okay, hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Make me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone, got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying, girl why you Mufasa
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
""My God, you pay for your friends?"" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we're Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
Beans they took from the cabinet (Whoa)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
'Til 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hold up
  No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side
'Til three thousand and five, hol' up
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)

Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
I used to care what people thought, but now I care more
I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So, therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it, so insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame, we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine, or leave it like Cobain
  And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs, got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go, Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk, at least I think so, can't tell
  'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care, it's kinda sad but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins, I'm stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping, I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special, and if I lose my mental
  Just hold my hand, even if you don't understand, hol' up
  No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you

Lay me gently in the cold dark earth

I woke with her walls around me
And I was burnin up a fever

When in Rome we landed our first kiss
I slurred my words but he pretended not to notice
And then he sat down to play
My heart sang a symphony
So far, so swimmingly
I'm glad I got out to find my fish in that sea
We've come so far
So who gives a damn about the ages we are

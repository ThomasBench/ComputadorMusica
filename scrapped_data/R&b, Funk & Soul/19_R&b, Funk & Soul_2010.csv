0,Foreigners God,Hozier,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/hozier/foreigners-god-chords-1693091,"She moves with shameless wonder
The perfect creature rarely seen
Since some liar brought the thunder
When the land was godless and free
Her eyes look sharp and steady
Into the empty parts of me
Still my heart is heavy
With the hate of some other man's beliefs
      Always a well dressed fraud
Who wouldn't spare the rod
Never for me
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner’s God
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
The purest expression of grief
Wondering who I copy
Mustering some tender charm
She feels no control of her body
She feels no safety in my arms
I've no language left to say it
All I do is quake to her
Breaking if I try to convey it
The broken love I make to her
      All that I've been taught
And every word I've got
Is foreign to me
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner’s God
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
The purest expression of grief
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner’s God
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
The purest expression of grief
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner’s God
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name
Of a foreigner's God
The purest expression of grief

How could I ignore you?
Trust me I adore you
             We’re swimming through our dreams
Kiss me in the shower
For a couple hours
             Though we’re only sixteen
And sit down beside me
Don’t call me daddy
             Cause that’s just fucking weird
Promise that you'll stay here
You and I can lay here
                         Until the end of time
But girl, well don't you worry about me
It ain’t new to me, feeling this lonely (Darling)
Girl, don't worry about me
But if you’re ever unhappy
Then maybe, baby, I must let you go
Let you go
Baby now it’s best here
to lay me down and rest here
                        Let’s dream of Corduroy
Work for what you love to do
and I will watch right over you
               With your heart I’ll never toy
And you’re the other half of me
Drink and sleep and laugh with me
                          Take me from myself
See I’m a fucking basket-case
Until I'm able to see your face
                    You saved me from myself

It ain’t new to me, feeling this lonely (Darling)

Walls I built up became my home
I’m strong and I’m sure there’s a fire in us

I catch my breath with just one beating heart
And I embrace myself, please don’t tear this apart

And boy, I believe in us

Can you see that I’m bound in chains?
I’ve finally found my way
I am bound to you
I am bound to you

I embrace my fears
All that I have been carrying all these years
Do I risk it all? Come this far just to fall?
Fall
I can trust and boy, I believe in us

Can you see that I’m bound in chains?

Lord, forgive me, she's bringin' out the devil in me

I know the Lord's been good to me, when I look at that preacher's daughter
She's my Delilah: she brings me to my knees
She could be an angel, Lord, she's bringing out the devil in me

Man, we stepping out like woa (Oh God!), cameras point and shoot
Ask me 'what's my best side?', I stand back and point at you, you
You the one that I argue with, feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But, the grass ain't always greener on the other side, it's green where you water it
So I know, we got issues baby, true, true, true
But I'd rather work on this you than to go ahead and start with someone new

But there's a moon above it's shining and I think I hear a call
It's just a whisper through the trees, my ears can hardly make it out
But I can hear it in my heart, vibrating strong as if she shouts
Oh Ariadne, I am coming, I just need to work this maze inside my head
I came here like you asked, I killed the beast, that part of me is dead
Oh Ariadne, I just need to work this maze inside my head
If only I'd have listened to you when you offered me that thread
Everything is quiet and I'm not exactly sure
If it really was your voice I heard or maybe it's a door
That's closing up some hero's back, on his track to be a man
Can it be that all us heroes have a path but not a plan?
Oh Ariadne, I'm coming, I just need to work this maze inside my mind
I wish I had that string, it's so damn dark, I think I'm going blind
Oh Ariadne, I just need to work this maze inside my mind
For the life of me I don't remember what I came to find
Now tell me princess are you strolling through your sacred grove?
And is the moon still shining? You're the only thing I'm thinking of
The sword you gave me, it was heavy, I just had to lay it down
It's funny how defenseless I can feel here when there's nobody around
Oh Ariadne, I'm coming, I just need to work this maze inside my heart
I was blind, I thought you'd bind me, but you offered me a chart
Oh Ariadne, I just need to work this maze inside my heart
If I'd known that you could guide me, I'd have listened from the start
Somewhere up there there midnight strikes, I think I hear the fall
Of little drops of water, magnified against the barren wall
It's more a feeling than a substance, but there's nobody around
And when I'm in here all alone, it's just enough to let me drown
Oh Ariadne, I was coming, but I failed you in this labyrinth of my past
Oh Ariadne, let me sing you, and we'll make each other last

she’s my rock, she’s my ball, she’s the teenage, she’s the trip 
And the girl’s so fine
Makes you wanna scream Hallelujah 
Yea-aaaah, ye-eeeeah 
How could i refuse I’m not fit to use 
(and funk my life up) 
say the only way I win is the way I lose 
(just funk my life up) 
And I never got a script, got a tip, got a little…up in my brain 
she’s the church, she’s a sin, she’s a diamond chaser 
she’s the rain 
And the girl’s so fine 
you wanna scream yea-aaaah, ye-eeeeah 
she gets me silly 
I don’t even know her name, yeah she sticks to me
and in the climax, she would scream to me 
she gets me funny, she doesn’t want any of my money 
hadn’t mentioned i’d back in my team 
super girl smoking my green 
oh Lord, reload, eyes bags, scream 
free thing, oh rings, yet back sing 
left out left out left out
And the girl’s so fine 
Makes you wanna scream Hallelujah 
Hallelujah
And the girl’s so fine 
you wanna scream yea-aaaah, ye-eeeeah

Without you I cannot breathe
Where am I if you're not there?
Won't live here without you

Won't live here without you
     Can't go through that again
I know there ain't two ways about it
You know that you should never doubt it
People make mistakes
Ascend with me up into heaven
And leave behind this Armageddon
I'll take you to a better place

Sometimes you hurt me too
Makes me go mad

Pour a little up now, for the love that we made

I see you, but you gone. Telephone the doctor, I'm not okay
The bottom of the bottle, to fill this empty heart up

I dive in, but I can't

no 'who cares', no vacant stares, no time for me

something so precious about this
where to begin
Babe,
there's something broken about this

To the strand a picnic plan for you and me
a rope in hand for your other man to hang from a tree

He'll never love you like I can, can, can
We both have demons, that we can't stand
I love your demons, like devils can
If you're still seeking an honest man
And stop deceiving Lord please
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
Now they always say congratulations
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it
They was never friendly, yeah
And I know I sound dramatic, yeah
For the money, I'm a savage, yeah
I'm surrounded 20 bad bitches, yeah
Everyone wanna act like they important
But all that mean nothing when I saw my dog
Everyone counting on me, drop the ball
Everything costing like I'm at the bottom, yeah, yeah
If you fuck with winning, put your lighters to the sky
How could I make sense when I got millions on my mind?
Coming with that bullshit, I just put it to the side
Balling since a baby, they could see it in my eyes
My mama called, seen you on TV, son
Said shit done changed ever since we was on
I dreamed it all ever since I was young
Now they always say congratulations
Worked so hard, forgot how to vacation
They ain't never had the dedication
People hatin', say we changed and look we made it
I was patient, yeah-oh
I was patient, ay-oh
Now I can scream that we made it
Now everyone, everywhere I go, they say 'gratulations
I pick up the rock and I ball, baby
But right now I got a situation
Big rings, champagne
But instead I'm in the trap, though
    Super Bowl, call the hoes, get in the Rolls
    Top floor lifestyle, Huncho and Post

And I'ma drop the top with no Rogaine (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
And now might sound irrelevant but I prefer to stack my chips
When everything fallin' (backwoods)
And I ain't religious but I look into the sky
And pray to anyone holy

45,In A Week (ver 2),Hozier,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/hozier/in-a-week-chords-2593062,"I have never known peace like the damp grass that yields to me
I have never known hunger like these insects that feast on me
A thousand teeth and yours among them, I know
Our hungers appeased, our heart beats becoming slow
We'll lay here for years or for hours
Thrown here or found, to freeze or to thaw
So long, we'd become the flowers
Two corpses we were, two corpses I saw
And they'd find us in a week
When the weather gets hot
After the insects have made their claim
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
I have never known sleep like this slumber that creeps to me
I have never known colors like this morning reveals to me
And you haven't moved an inch such that I would not know
If you sleep always like this, flesh calmly going cold
We'll lay here for years or for hours
Your hand in my hand, so still and discreet
So long, we'd become the flowers
We'd feed well the land and worry the sheep
And they'd find us in a week
When the cattle show fear
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
They'd find us in a week
When the weather gets hot
And they'd find us in a week
When the cattle show fear
And they'd find us in a week
When the buzzards get loud
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
After the raven has had his say
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
And they'd find us in a week

Dealing with emotions that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game
Maybe I'm the sinner, and not a saint
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers anyway? We're all the same
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds?
And stop acting like we’re blind
Cause if the water dries up
And the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, hold on
There's no pot of gold at the rainbows we chase
But we're holding on, hold on

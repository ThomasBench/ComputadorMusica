Damn, I'm sorry you had to find out like that

Wait a minute
Can we talk a minute? Oh
I'm sorry you had to find out   this way
There's this guy I've been seein', hold on tho-ugh
Every time I close my eyes,   he's in my thoughts
We've been going through it for some time now
It ain't my fault, no
I'm just tryna be truthful to you
And let you know
Every time I try to leave, something always tells me no
And just when I think it's working itself out,    can't be so
Everything we worked so hard for, should we let it go?
It's no fair to leave without tryna work it out
And there's someone else you've been seeing
I ain't a fooool, no
And it's been going on for some time now
It's so obvious
Now she's been taking my place some of the time that you've been gone, yeah
Why won't you just be truthful to me, yeah, and let me know-oh-oww
Every time I try to leave something always tells me no
And just when I think it's working itself out,     can't be so
    Everything we worked so hard for, should we let it go?
It's no fair to leave without (Without you) tryna work it out
(And I know, oh) I know sometimes it can get rough
It means so much when it comes to us
I can't just walk away from the only thing I know (The only thing I know)
Tell me if you think it's worth working out
'Cause I'll be right here if you have no doubt
(No doubt) That we can (That we can) make it, 'cause, baby

Somehow this doesn't concern me

I'm going on

I'm going on

I want nothing to do with
And to do what I want
And to do what I please
Is first of my to-do list

One of the few things I do miss
But baby I've to go
Baby I've got to know
Baby I've got to prove it
And I'll see you when you get there...

But in my biggest picture
Was a photo of you and me
Girl, you know I try
I work hard to provide all the material  things
That I thought would make you happy
I'm confused, can you make me understand?
'Cause I try to give you the best of me
I thought we were cool, maybe I was blind
But never took time to see
Can you help me?
Tell me what you want from me
Can you help me?
Tell me why you wanna leave
Baby, help me
Without you, my whole world is falling apart
And I'm going crazy
Life's a prison when you're in love alone
(Ooh, girl, I love you)
I need you to come back home (you know I need you)
I don't wanna be alone
Why?
Girl, I put your love up on a shelf
And I guess I just left it to die
Now we're not together
'Cause I hurt you too many times
And now you're not around
I wish for every moment of time that got wasted
We used it to make sweet love
Baby, be my guide, please take my hand
Want you to know that I got you if you need it
Don't wanna be on the outside looking in
I gotta have you girl, can't you see
Can you help me?
Tell me what you want from me
Can you help me?
Tell me why you wanna leave
Baby, help me
Without you, my whole world is falling apart
And without you I think I'll go crazy
Life's a prison when you're in love alone
(Ooh, girl, I love you)
I need you to come back home (you know I need you)
I don't wanna be alone
Take me would you please
Please stay, don't go
I don't want it to be over
Give me another chance, I wanna be your man
Girl, you got me down here on my knees
Crying, begging, pleading, I'll do anything for your love
Whoa
Would you help me?
Tell me what you want from me
Can you help me?
Tell me why you want to leave (I don't understand, girl, I'm just a man)
Baby, help me
Without you, my whole world is falling apart
And without you, girl, I'm going crazy
Life's a prison without your love
Can you help me?
Tell me why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Can you help me?
Girl, I'll never stop 'cause you're all I got, baby (please stay, don't go, don't wanna be alone)
Can you help me?
Help me understand, why I can't be your man
It's driving me crazy (crazy, crazy, crazy)
Oh, baby
Ooh, girl, I love you (said I love you, girl)
You know I need you (I need you)
I can't live without you (I can't go one day without you)
Ooh, girl, I love you (ooh, girl, I need you)
You know I need you
I can't live without you (Can I have you?)
Ooh, girl, I love you
You know I need you
I can't live without you
Ooh, girl, I love you (if you understand, can you help me now?)
You know I need you (sing along)
I can't live without you (Yeah, babe)

'Cause we can never act out our parts

If love was a light, then we're lost in the dark
Left with no one to hold
If love was a sport, we're not on the same team
You and I are destined to lose
If love was an ocean, then we are just a stream

I can't say we didn't try to make it work for you and I
I know it hurts so much, but it's best for us

  Girl its been too long
And I can't go on
Can't be actin' like I don't care
  Cause I rolled with you
  I grew up with you
My momma used to sit you when your moms weren't home
Always friends with you
Never stepped to you
But now its time that I start makin' love to you
Time passes by for more than a lifetime

I would give up my life
To spend just one night with you
Cause my love don't stop
I can't lie you bring out the best in me
I got's to be yours girl
I would give up my life
There's nothin' that I won't do
Cause my love don't stop

Just the way we are so we don't mess things up
But its killin' me, cause the rest of me
Wants to feel your body baby, wants to tear it up
  I'll do some things to you
  No one else can do
Cause maybe I'm the one to make you feel real good
Bein' friends is cool, I'm always there to you

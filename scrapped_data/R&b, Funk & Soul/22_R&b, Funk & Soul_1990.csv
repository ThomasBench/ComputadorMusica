I want to give my heart, my soul, my love
To you, oh baby, yeah, 'cause every day
I'm not with you, I'm missin' you

Love me, hold me, touch me
Down deep in my soul, never let you go
Of the love we share, no one compares to you
I'll never let you go

I'm nothing without you, it's funny how I
Know what people mean boy

Joy, good love, good times

That's why I am so glad I found you baby
I wished upon a star and it came true
Darling, I need for you to
Love me, hold me, touch me
Down deep in my soul, never let you go
Of the love we share, no one compares to you

You don't make sense of what I say
And every answer begs another question why
I didn't want to
Maybe I could have changed the way it was
I could have made much more of us
And if I failed, perhaps it wasn't just because
I didn't want to
Don't take it as a sign
The stars were out of line
But heaven knows
Whoever I was then
She won't be back again so let her go
But you I wouldn't change
I wouldn't change
I wouldn't change you if I could
It's understood
They got hardboard, I got solid wood
Somehow if I am wont to take my time
If I dig in where I should mine
It doesn't build a case for your friends to decide
I didn't want you
Don't take it on yourself
Put your heartache on the shelf and come away
Just because you got drunk first
Doesn't mean that I don't thirst for you today
And you I wouldn't change
I wouldn't change
I wouldn't change you if I could

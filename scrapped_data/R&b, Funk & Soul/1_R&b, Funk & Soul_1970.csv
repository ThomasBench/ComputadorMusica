It's not warm when she's away.
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, and she's always gone too long,
Anytime she goes away.
Wonder this time where she's gone,
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, and this house just ain't no home,
Anytime she goes away.
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone
only darkness everyday.
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone, and this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away.
Anytime she goes away.
Anytime she goes away.
Anytime she goes away.

Lean on me, when you're not strong

Somebody to lean on

Those of your needs

With a language we all under-stand.
 With an equal oppor-tunity,
For all to sing, dance, and clap their ha-nds.
But just be-cause a record has a groove,
Don't make it in the groove.
But you can tell right a-way at letter A,
When the peo-ple start to move.
 They can feel it all over, they can feel it all over people.
 They can feel it all over, they can feel it all over people.
 Music knows it is and always will,
Be one of the things that life just won't quit.

That time will not allow us to for-get;
For there's Basie, Miller, Satch-mo,
And the King of all, Sir Duke.

There's no way the band can lose.

 Then my only worry, was for Christmas; what would be my toy.
 Even though we sometimes would not get a thing;
 We were happy with the joy the day would bring.
 Sneaking out the back door,
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine.
 Greeted at the back door,
With; ""boy, I thought I told you not to go out-side?""
 Tryin' your best to bring the water to you eyes.
 Thinkin' it might stop her, from whoopin' your be-hind.
I wish those days, could, come back once more,
Why did those days, e   -ver have to go?
I wish those days, could, come back once more,
Why did those days, e   -ver have to go? 'Cos I love them so.
  Do do do do, do do do do, do do do do.
  Do do do do, do do do do, do do do do.
 Brother says he's tellin',
 'Bout you playing doctor with that girl.
 Just don't tell; I'll give you,
 Anything you want in this whole wide world.
 Mama gives you money, for Sunday school,
 You trade yours for candy, after church is through.
 Smokin' ciga-rettes and,
And writing something nasty on the wall, (you nasty boy!)
 Teacher sends you to the principals of-fice down the hall.
 You grow up and learn that, kinda thing ain't right.
 But while you were doin' it; it sure felt outta sight.
I wish those days, could, come back once more,
Why did those days, e   -ver have to go?

Then my only worry, was for Christmas what would be my toy,
Even though we sometimes, would not get a thing,
We were happy with the, joy the day would bring,
Sneakin out the back door, to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door with ""Boy, I thought I told you not to go outside"",
Tryin your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinkin it might stop her from whoopin' your behind
I wish those days,  could,  come back once more
Why did those days   e-     ver    have to go
I wish those days,  could,  come back once more

Brother says he's tellin, bout you playin doctor with that girl
Just don't tell Ill give you, anything you want in this whole wide world,
Mama gives you money, for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy, after church is through
Smokin cigarettes and writin' somethin nasty on the wall (you nasty boy!)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kind of thing ain't right
But while you were doin it, it sure felt outta sight

 Morning rain, gently plays her rhythms on your window pane
 Giving you no clue of when she plans to change
 To bring rain or sunshine
 And so you wait to see what she'll do
 Is it sun or rain for you?

 But not waiting for your answer he begins,
 Forcing danger's way with his breeze.
 Morning snow, plans to have a winter ball for you to throw
 But just where or when he never lets you know
 If it's snow, or clear days you'll find
 And so you wait to see what he'll do;

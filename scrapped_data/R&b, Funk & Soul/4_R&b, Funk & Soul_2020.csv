0,Demasiadas Mujeres,C. Tangana,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/c-tangana/demasiadas-mujeres-chords-3411206,"| Am | N.C. |
Desfilaba en Milán
Con veintiuno, campañas de Prada y ahora duerme aquí
La miro pensando cuánto faltará para que empiece a odiar
La forma que tengo de amarla tan mal, mi manera de huir
Que no puedo parar
No he olvidado el olor
De la que me follé en el baño de un garito, borracho en Berlín
Escuchando un techno que me hacía empujarla como un animal
Música del infierno que sonará el día de mi funeral
Demasiadas mujeres
Demasiadas mujeres
Demasiadas mujeres
Demasiadas mujeres
Demasiadas mujeres
Demasiadas mujeres
Demasiadas mujeres
Demasiadas mujeres
Un WhatsApp sin abrir
Hablando de cosas que no dicen nada pa' ver si aún estás
Borracho en Miami, volando pa' L.A. o de vuelta en Madrid
Cuéntame cosas que no me hagan daño, ¿cuándo volverás?
No me puedo olvidar
De la que me dijo que siempre pa' siempre estaría pa' mí
De la que decía que solo una noche y después no hubo más
De la que que se fue con mis ganas de amar, mis ganas de vivir
Demasiadas mujeres
Demasiadas mujeres

1,Blue,Madison Beer,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/madison-beer/blue-chords-3583799,"  I was always blue behind the red-blood stain on my lips
  You were always green with envy, saw right through the tenderness
We were like a California sunset, fated to die any minute
  Gettin' rid of you might be the best thing I ever did
And I was seein' us in a silent movie
Takin' off our gloves like a violent crime scene
Diamonds in the cut always know how to fool me
  Oh, honey
But I know when to run, run, run
I know when to run, run, run
I know when to run, run, run
When my makeup does, when my makeup does
And I know when to run, run, run
I know when to run, run
And I know when to run, run, run
When my makeup does, when my makeup does
  I was always blue behind the black mascara that I cry
You could be as sweet as honey but I knew the darkness in your mind
We were like a gorgeous bed of roses ready to die any minute
  Gettin' rid of you might be the best thing I ever did
And I was seein' us in a silent movie
Takin' off our gloves like a violent crime scene
Diamonds in the cut always know how to fool me

Al salir cierren la puerta
Que aquí nadie le ha invitado
No me interesa lo que piensan
Y que se mueran todos los hijos de puta (Todos)

Que están hablando a mis espaldas para que caiga

Cut through my own desire

I tried to call
But can I stay the night?

Turning my tears into diamonds that fall through your sky
And after all that you promised
All I ever wanted was you

No heat worth holding onto

Y que me perdone la Vírgen de la Almudena
Las cosas que hago en tu cama

 Leaving hardly hurts at all
 I'm sorry that I never call
Often I get exhausted
Trying regardless to be enough
Is it selfish not to be selfless
When all I can help is to open up?
I'll be better than I was before
Despite every text of yours ignored
Will you call me still, just to hear my voice?
I swear, always, I'll care
  (I'll care)
 Flipping through our photographs
 Those moments never seem to last
 Listening to self-control
 Those feelings that you'll never know
Leave me, it's never easy
I've had a lifetime to be alone
If you let me, when it gets heavy
Know I'll never let you be all alone
I'll be better than I was before

You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

Was is that fight we didn't have when I came in?
Was is the first time that you saw me drunk?
Second time that I said, ""I'm sorry""?
Third time that I didn't call?
  That time I met your friends I was indifferent
  The way you act has got me questioning
When was it over for you?
When was it over?
When was the moment you knew
That you were gonna walk out eventually?
It's still not over for me
It's still not over for me
And I didn't ask if you were okay
After a fight with your mom
The last timе I stayed over at your place
And you wokе up alone
Was is the first time you pulled away?
Second time that we drove to Texas?
Third time we ran into one of my random exes?
  So was it ever real?
  Or was it all pretend?
  The way you act has got me wondering
When was it over for you?
When was it over? (When was it over?)

Had a pretty boy over, but he couldn't stay
On his way out I made him sign an NDA, mm

Once is good enough
'Cause I don't want him having shit to say-ay, ayy, ayy, ayy-ayy

Somewhere in Kuwait where I can disappear

Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth
At least I gave him something he can cry about

Enough

Could meet
Again
Sometime
When we
Could be

0,If I Like It I Do It (verÂ 2),Jamiroquai,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/jamiroquai/if-i-like-it-i-do-it-chords-2798576,"Whoa-ho-ho, yeah-heh-heh
Oh, don't ya know
If I like it, I just do it
Yeah
Say that we have all the time we need to make it right
Don't hurry for nobody, if it ain't the thing you like
""Know your place, and fit your space young man, you will conform""
I didn't hear my soul express those rules when I was born
Free to roam cause it's my home you can't stop sweet inclination
The kids want the system breaking down not higher education
If it ain't no natural law, then you can keep your regulations
Cause if I like it, I do it
But I keep on moving,
though they wanna bring me down I gotta run for the cover
And I keep on smiling,
though they wanna tie me down and give me death for the lover
And I keep on losing,
Though I'm proving what I'm doin'
I'm still groovin'
And if I like it, I do it, yeah
You've got to help those people break that legislation
We can overcome their suffocation
Execute your natural liberation
Happy to enjoy rejuvenation
All around hear the sound, no-one can stop us now
A thousand rules for plastic fools, now they can take a bow
Surely there's been time to see it doesn't work by now
So if I like it, I just do it
Still I keep on
Finding that they're pushing those distorted visions
And I keep on living
though I'm dying cause of their decisions
If I keep on looking
I can find a higher space
I'm still grooving
And if I like it, I do it, yeah

I'm coming back to you
I just stopped to say
That everything we did is through
You tried to undermine
The better ranges of my nature
But soon you're going to find
You should have started talking straighter
Now don't you worry
I won't put you down
I'm in no hurry, babe
To see you go to ground
Because it's true what they say
You know, it's true what they say
You're only king for a day
I hope you're happy that way
There's no hope
For peace and reconciliation
You're quick to play your hand
But what you haven't learnt is patience
So look before you leap
To tell the world your coloured story
It's clear your talk is cheap
Do anything to get your glories
So spread your wings and fly
There is no doubt
You're so sure inside, you've got something to
Shout about
Because it's true what they say
You know, it's true what they say
You're only king for a day
I guess you're happy that way
And there's no love
Ever to be lost between us
I guess this is because
The damage you've done is so grievous
So I hang my head
To dwell on what might have been
But what you left instead
Pieces of a broken dream
Now don't you worry
I won't put you down
I'm in no hurry, babe
To see you go to ground
Because it's true what they say
You know, it's true what they say
You're only king for a day
I guess you're happy that way
So spread your wings and fly

Shout about

You're only king for a day

46,Reunited,Tom Jones,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tom-jones/reunited-chords-3710057,"I was a fool to ever leave your side
Me minus you is such a lonely ride
The breakup we had has made me lonesome and sad
I realize I love you 'cause I want you bad, hey, hey
Regret the moment that I let you go
Our quarrel was such a way of learnin' so much
I know now that I love you 'cause I need your touch, hey,
Hey reunited and it feels so good
Reunited 'cause we understood
There's one perfect fit
We both are so excited 'cause we're reunited,
hey, hey
I sat here starin' at the same old wall
Came back to life just when
I could climb right through the telephone line
And give you what you want so you will still be mine
I can't go cheatin', honey, I can't play
I found it very hard to stay away
As we reminisce on precious moments like this
I'm glad we're back together 'cause I missed your kiss, hey,
Hey reunited and it feels so good
Reunited 'cause we understood
There's one perfect fit
We both are so excited 'cause we're reunited,
hey, hey reunited
Reunited
Reunited

47,Too Much Too Little Too Late,Tom Jones,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tom-jones/too-much-too-little-too-late-chords-3730760,"Guess it's over, call it a day
Sorry that it had to end this way
No reason to pretend
We knew it had to end some day, this way
Yes, it's over, the kids are gone
What's the use of tryin' to hang on?
Somewhere we lost the key
So little left for you and me and it's clear to see
Too much, too little, too late to lie again with you
Too much, too little, too late to try again with you
We're in the middle of ending something that we knew
It's over oh yes it was over
Guess it's over, the chips are down
Nearly all our bridges tumbled down
Whatever chance we try, let's face it, why deny
It's over it's all over
Yes it's over
Too much, too little, too late to ever try again
Too much, too little, too late, let's end it being friends
Too much, too little, too late, we knew it had to end
Ah, it's over it's over
Too much, too little, too late to ever try again
Too much, too little, too late, let's end it being friends
Too much, too little, too late, we knew it had to end

48,Quand Elle Rit Aux Ãclats,Vaya Con Dios,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/3326552,"Elle se dÃ©hanche, s'avance, se penche
Rousse, provocante, elle te mate, elle te vampe
Toi, tu sais dÃ©jÃ , qu'il n'y aura plus qu'elle
Son corps, sa voix qui t'ensorcellent
Tu ne vois pas qu'elle t'Ã©pie, qu'elle te guette
Quand, avec d'autres, elle rit aux clats
Fatale, elle se pÃ¢me, t'alarme, te dÃ©sarme
S'appuie sur ton Ã©paule, s'accroche Ã  tes paroles
Toi, tu crois dÃ©jÃ  qu'elle chancelle et chavire
Quand, alanguie, elle frÃ©mit et soupire
Tu n'est comprends pas qu'elle est de celles qui charment
Avec leur   corps et sans leur Ã¢me
Elle se dÃ©hanche, s'avance, se penche
Frivole, elle papillonne, se pose et puis s'envole
Toi, tu sens dÃ©jÃ  ton coeur qui se lÃ©zarde
Tu donnerais tout pour qu'elle s'attarde
Tu n'imagines pas qu'elle l'Ã©pie, qu'elle le guette
Quand, avec toi, elle rit aux clats
Toi Tu ne vois pas le piÃ¨ge
Qui fera voler ton coeur aux Ã©clats

Is this a fantasy come
true Is this a dream
that I've waited for
Am I the one that you adore
Whoa   I think I'm
falling for you
Whoa   What am I
supposed to do
  Cause you make me feel
Like I'm falling in love
(am I falling for you)
love   Tell me boy
Is it true, I get
a rush   when I
think about you
Lose Control   From
my body and my soul
And when you hold me
I don't want to let go
  you give me reason
Every reason just 
to Love you babe (babe)
  Everything that you
do Is so amazing
  I can't believe what 
Your body makes me wanna
do I'm having visions
Of me all over you
You must have known
though I try to disguise
The way I feel   was
there fire in my eyes
On that night   when
our bodies intertwined
I knew right there and
then that you will be mine
Could I be falling for you
Is this a fantasy come
true Is this a dream
that I've waited for
Am I the one that you adore
  Every day
You seem to find a 
way to make me go crazy
  I just can't understand but 
let me tell you one thing
  You make me wanna sing
Could I be fal--ling for you
Is this a fantasy come
true Is this a dream
that I've waited for
Am I the one that you adore

 Since you took your love, pre-tending never ends, yeah.
 But I can't let you know, that I still need you so, no.

The tears that I cry).
When-ever you're near, I hide my tears, be-hind a painted smile.
 You can't imagine the tears and sorrow, be-hind a painted smile.
 I can't let you see, all the tears I'm cry-ing.
 You would pity me; that would be like dy-ing.
 If I can't have your love, I don't need your sympa-thy.

While riding I think of us, dear,

And all through my coffee break-time,
I say a little prayer for you

And he strikes, like Thunderball.
Any woman he wants, he'll get.
He will break any heart without regret.

I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey! Mister Tambourine Man, play a song for me.
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you.
Though I know that evenin's empire has returned into the sand.
Vanished from my hand, left me blindly here to stand
but still not sleeping!
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet I have no one to meet.
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel the grip,
my toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
to be wandering
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade cast your dancing spell my way,
I promise to go under it
Though you might hear laughin' spinnin' swingin' madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escapin' on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facin'
And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're
seein' that he's chasing
Then take me dissapearin' through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightended trees out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand wavin' free
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate drive deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow

Turning from side to side
The woman that I'm lovin'
She stays on my mind

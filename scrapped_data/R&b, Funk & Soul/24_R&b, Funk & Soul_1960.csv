 Since you took your love, pre-tending never ends, yeah.
 But I can't let you know, that I still need you so, no.

The tears that I cry).

 You can't imagine the tears and sorrow, be-hind a painted smile.
 I can't let you see, all the tears I'm cry-ing.
 You would pity me; that would be like dy-ing.
 If I can't have your love, I don't need your sympa-thy.

While riding I think of us, dear,

And all through my coffee break-time,
I say a little prayer for you

He acts while other men just talk.
He looks at this world, and wants it all,
So he strikes, like Thunderball.
He knows the meaning of success.
His needs are more, so he gives less.
They call him the winner who takes all.
And he strikes, like Thunderball.
Any woman he wants, he'll get.
He will break any heart without regret.
His days of asking are all gone.
His fight goes on and on and on.
But he thinks that the fight is worth it all.
So he strikes like Thunderball.

part of your time each day

A minute of your time
Is all it takes to bring us close
When we are far apart

You'll find that I'm there in your heart
May help to keep the wolf away
Until that moment you are back to stay

Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye

In a great big old house full of butlers and maids
She says no one is better than I
I know I'm just an average guy
No football hero or smooth Don Juan
Got empty pockets
You see I'm a poor man's son

Never never make my baby cry

I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
Hey! Mister Tambourine Man, play a song for me.
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you.
Though I know that evenin's empire has returned into the sand.
Vanished from my hand, left me blindly here to stand
but still not sleeping!
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet I have no one to meet.
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirlin' ship
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel the grip,
my toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
to be wandering
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade cast your dancing spell my way,
I promise to go under it
Though you might hear laughin' spinnin' swingin' madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escapin' on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facin'
And if you hear vague traces of skippin' reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're
seein' that he's chasing
Then take me dissapearin' through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightended trees out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand wavin' free
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate drive deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow

They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you

You too might be

Turning from side to side
The woman that I'm lovin'
She stays on my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love
Feels good all the time
Now let's get it now baby!
Let me tell you baby
I'll tell you what I want to do
I would rob, steal, kill somebody
To get some money for you
Cause I'm in love, I'm in love
Feels good all the time

Tell you what it's all about
When I see you honey child
You make me wanna jump and shout

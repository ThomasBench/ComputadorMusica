 The kind you don't take home to mother
 She will never let your spirits down
 Once you get her off the street, ow girl
 She likes the boys in the band
 She says that I'm her all-time favorite
 When I make my move to her room
 It's the right time
 She's never hard to please
 Oh, no
 That girl is pretty wild now
 (The girl's a super freak)
 The kind of girl you read about
 (In new-wave magazines)
 That girl is pretty kinky
 (The girl's a super freak)
 I really love to taste her
 (Every time we meet)
 She's all right, she's all right
 That girl's all right
 With me, yeah
 She's a super freak, super freak
 She's super-freaky, yow

1,All I Do,Stevie Wonder,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/stevie-wonder/all-i-do-chords-753035," You made my soul a burning fire;
You're getting to be my one desire.
 You're getting to be all that matters to me.
 And let me tell you, girl;
 I hope and pray each day I live,
A little more love I have to give;
 A little more love that's de-voted and true.
'Cos all I do is think about you.
 All I    do, is think a-bout yo-u.
 All I    do, is think a-bout yo-u.
 Baby, just sup-pose,
I should happen to cross your mind.
And by some chance, a boy like me,
You're really been trying to find.
 Well, let me tell you girl;
 Think of how ex-citing it would be,
If you should dis-cover you feel like me.
  If you should dis-cover this dream is for two.
 Well, I'm gonna tell you girl;
 I'd light a candle every day,
And pray that you'll always feel this way.
 And pray that our love will for-ever be new,
'Cos all I do is think about you.
 All I    do, is think a-bout yo-u.
 All I    do, is think a-bout yo-u.
 Well, let me tell you, girl;
 I'd light a candle every day,
And pray that you'll always feel this way.
 And pray that our love will for-ever be new,
 Well, I'm gonna tell you, girl;
 If I can-not have you for my own;
I'd rather be lonely and all alone.
 I'd rather keep thinking the way that I do,

just begun
 When it's this good, there's no 
saying no
 I want you so, I'm ready to go
Through the fire, to the limit,

I'd gladly risk it all

For a chance at loving you
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire

 I know you're afraid of what 
you feel
You still need time to heal
And I can help if you'll only 
let me try
 You touch me and something in 
me knew
What I could have with you
Now I'm not ready
To kiss that dream goodbye
 When it's this sweet, there's 
no saying no

To taste the sweet I faced the pain

When I'm racing with destiny

I want it all, no time for less
I've laid the plans, now lay the chance

Make it shine

 Get me out, into the night-time;
 Four walls won't hold me, to-night.
 If this town, is just an apple;
 Then let me take a bite. (If they say);
 Why? why? Tell them that its human nature.
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? (If they say);
 Why? why? Tell them that its human nature.
 Why? why? Does he do me that way?
 Reaching out, to touch a stranger;
 Electric eyes are every-where.
 See that girl; she knows I'm watching,
 She likes the way I stare. (If they say):

 Why? why? Does he do me that way? (If they say);

I like lovin' this way.           That way.

 The city's heart begin to beat.
 Reaching out, I touch her shoulder;
 I'm dreaming of the street. (If they say):

When love is gone
Still you made your mark
Here in my heart
One day I'll fly away
Leave your love to yesterday
What more can your love do for me
When  will love  be through with me?
I follow the night
Can't stand the light
When will I begin
     My life again
One day I'll fly away
Leave your love to yesterday
What more can your love do for me
When  will love  be through with me?
Why live life from dream to dream
And dread the day that dreaming ends
One day I'll fly away

What more can your love do for me
When  will love  be through with me?
Why live life from dream to dream
And dread the day that dreaming ends

Free from all worries

Freer than the clock's hands
Tickin' way the times
Freer than the meaning of free that man defines
Life running through me
Till I feel my father God has called
Me having nothin'
But possessing riches more than all
And I'm free
To be nowhere
But in every place I need to be
Freer than a sunbeam
Shining through my soul
Free from feelin' heat or knowing bitter cold
Free from conceiving the beginning
For that's the infinite start
I'm gone - gone but still living
Life goes on without a beating heart
Free like a vision
That the mind of only you can see
Freer than a raindrop
Falling from the sky
Freer than a smile in a baby's sleepin' eyes

Flowin' freely through infinity
I'm free to be sure of
what I am and who I need not to be
I'm much freer - like the meaning of the word free that crazy man defines

As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all its sad good-byes
I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know your not a fool
Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I'd been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
Time can never mend
The careless whispers, of a good friend

19,Spill The Wine,Eric Burdon and War,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/eric-burdon-and-war/spill-the-wine-chords-1856546,"I was once out strolling one very hot summer's day,
When I thought I'd lay myself down to rest,
In a big field of tall grass.
I laid there in the sun and felt it caressing my face.
As I fell asleep and dreamed,
I dreamed I was in a Hollywood movie,
And that I was the star of the movie.
This really blew my mind,
The fact that me an overfed long haired leaping gnome,
Should be the star of a Hollywood movie, hmmm.      1:28
There I was, ummm, I was taken to a place, the hall of the mountain kings
I stood high upon a mountain top, naked to the world
In front of every kind of girl, there was
Long one's, tall ones, short ones, brown ones, 
Black ones, round ones, big ones, crazy ones
Out of the middle, came a lady
She whispered in my ear something crazy, she said,        2:25
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl
Spill the wine, take that pearl  2:41
I thought to myself, what could that mean?
Am I going crazy, or is this just a dream.
I know I'm lying in a field of grass somewhere
So it's all in my head
And then I heard her say one more time  3:12
Spill the wine, take that girl
Spill the wine, take that girl
Spill the wine, take that girl
Spill the wine, take that girl    3:28
I could feel hot flames of fire roaring at my back
As she disappeared, but soon she returned
In her hand was a bottle of wine
In the other a glass
She poured some of the wine from the bottle into the glass
And raised it to her lips
And just before she drank it, she said  4:08
Take the wine, take that girl
Spill the wine, take that girl
Spill the wine, take that girl, c’mon, c’mon,
Spill the wine, take that girl
Take that girl,          yeah!              4:27
It's on girl, all you gotta do is spill that wine
Spill that wine, let me feel, let me feel hot, yeah! yeah! Owww, 
Spill the wine, spill the wine, spill the wine, spill the wine, 
Take that girl!                4:54

 We are strangers by day, lovers by night.
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right.
If I'm with friends and we should meet, just pass me by; don't even speak.
 Know the word's ""dis-creet"", with part-time lo-vers.
But if there's some emergency; have a male friend to ask for me,
So then she won't peek it's really you; my part-time lo-ver.

You and me; part-time lov-ers.

and it's finally hit me all at once.
All at once          I've started counting teardrops,
and at least a million fell, my eyes began to swell,
and all my dreams were shattered all at once.
    Ever since I met you, you're the only love I've known,
       and I can't forget you, though I must face it all alone.
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea,
wishing you'd come back to me,

that you were with another love in someone else's arms,
and all my dreams were shattered, all at once.
All at once             the smile that used to greet me
brightened someone else's day, she took your smile away,
and left me with just memories, all at once.

I still remember in the days when I was scared to touch you
How I spent my day dreaming planning how to say I love you

That's when you opened up your heart and you told me to come in

I called you up but you weren't there and I was broken hearted
Hung up the phone can't be too late the boss is so demanding
Open the door up and to my surprise there you were standing
Who needs to go to work to hustle for another dollar
I'd rather be with you cos you make my life scream and holler
Love is a gamble that I'm so-oo glad that I am winning
We've come a long way and yet this is only the beginning

Don't bother knockin' on my door
I got a lion in my pocket
And baby he's ready to roar
Everybody's got a bomb
We could all die any day
But before I'll let that happen
I'll dance my life away          'Cuz they say...

So take my strong a-dvice; just remember to always think twice.

You know you'll never           love that way again
Didn't we almost have it all 
Didn't we have the best of times
When love was young and new
Couldn't we reach inside and find
The world of me and you
We'll    never lose it again 
Cause once you know what love is
You'll never let it end
Didn't we almost have it all
Didn't we almost have it all

Now it's finally my turn
This is the last time I'll fall... in love

There was a moment when everything was clear
I didn't need to ask or even wonder why, because each question is answered when your near

Now don't hold back, just let me know
Could I be moving much too fast or way too slow

To find that once in a lifetime, this is it, I'll never be the same
You'll never know what it's taken me to say these words
And now that I've said them, they could never be enough

And the men notice you, with ya Gucci bag crew, Can't tell who he's lookin' to.
'Cos you all look the same; ev'ry-one knows your name,
And that's you whole claim to fa-ame.
Nev-er miss a night, 'cuz your dream in life, Is to be a foot-ball-ers wife.
You don't like players, that's what you sa-ay,
But you really wouldn't mind a million-aire.
You don't like ballers, they don't do nothing for ya,
But you'd love a rich man, six feet two or ta-aller.
You're more than a fan, look-in' for a man, But you end up with one-night-sta-ands.
He could be your whole life, if you got past one night,
But that part never goes right.
In the morning you're vexed, he's onto the next, And you didn't even get no te-ext.
Don't be too up-set, if they call you a sket,
'Cause like the news; ev'ry day you get press.
You don't like players, that's what you sa-ay,
But you really wouldn't mind a million-aire.
All them big ballers, they don't do nothing for ya,
But you'd love a rich man, six feet two or taller.
You can't sit down right, 'cos you jeans are too tight,
And your lucky it's ladies ni-ight.
With your big empty purse, every week it gets worse,
At least your breasts cost more than he-ers.
So you did Mia-mi, 'cos you got there for free,
But somehow, you missed the pla-ane.
You did too much E;  met somebo-dy, And spent the night getting caned.
Without girls like you, there'd be no fu-un;
We'd go to the club, and not see any-one.
Without girls like you, there's no night life,
All those men just go home to their wi-ives.
Don't be mad at me, 'cos you're pushing thir-ty,
And your old tricks no longer wo-ork.
You should have known from the jump, that you always get dumped;
So dust off your fuck me pumps.

People keep talking
They can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you... you... you...
Can get in the way of what I feel
I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try
Try to divide
Something so real
So till the end of time
I'm telling you there ain't no one
No one no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feeling
No one no one no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

47,Please Dont Stop The Rain (ver 2),James Morrison,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/james-morrison/please-dont-stop-the-rain-chords-803311,"I don't know where I crossed the line
Was it something that I said
Or didn't say this time
And I don't know if it's me or you
But I can see the skies are changing
In all the shades of blue
And I don't know which way it's gonna go
If it's gonna be a rainy day
There's nothing we can do to make it change
We can pray for sunny weather
But that won't stop the rain
Feeling like you got no place to run
I can be your shelter 'til it's done
We can make this last forever
So please don't stop the rain
(Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall)
Please don't stop the rain
I thought that time was on our side
I've put in far too many years
To let this pass us by
You see live is a crazy thing
There'll be good time and there'll be bad times
And everything in between
And I don't know which way it's gonna go
If it's gonna be a rainy day
There's nothing we can do to make it change
We can pray for sunny weather
But that won't stop the rain
Feeling like you got no place to run
I can be your shelter 'til it's done
We can make this last forever
So please don't stop the rain
(Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall)
Please don't stop the rain
(Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall)
Oh we're a little closer now
And finding what life's it's all about
Yeah I know you just can't stand it
When things don't go your way 
But we've got no control over what happens anyway
If it's gonna be a rainy day
There's nothing we can do to make it change
We can pray for sunny weather
But that won't stop the rain
Feeling like you got no place to run
I can be your shelter 'til it's done
We can make this last forever
So please don't stop the rain
(Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall)
Please don't stop the rain
(Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall)
Please don't stop the rain
(Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall)
(Let it fall, let it fall, let it fall)
Let it fall, please don't stop the rain

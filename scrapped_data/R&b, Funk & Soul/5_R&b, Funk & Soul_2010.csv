Don't be discouraged
Oh I realize
It's hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
And the darkness, inside you
Can make you feel so small
Show me a smile then,
Don't be unhappy, can't remember
when   I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
Just call me up
Cause' I will always be there 
And I see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful,
I see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful,
Like a rainbow

I'm not a piece of cake

While you walk away

I gave to you last night

You taste like buttercream

Naubusan ng bakit
Bakit umalis ng walang sabi
Bakit, di sya lumaban kahit konti?
Bakit, di maitama ang tadhana?
At nakita kita sa tagpuan ni Bathala
May kinang sa mata na di maintindihan
Tumingin kung saan sinubukan kong lumisan
At tumigil ang mundo
Nung ako'y ituro mo
Siya ang panalangin ko
At hindi, di mapaliwanag
Ang nangyari sa akin
Saksi ang lahat ng tala
Sa iyong panalangin
Paano nasagot lahat ng bakit?
Di makapaniwala sa nangyari
Paano mo naitama ang tadhana?

Stay up tonight, stay up at night

She sent me naked pictures from her neck down to the waist
I get my feelings involved, she stopped returnin' my calls
And flaws turned into walls and barricades
And I'm too far gone and over both ways
And now every long day is a bad one
I can't make you call or make you stay
Or take you off the pedestal
So I get lost in modern music watchin' movies, talkin' to the walls in my room
Walkin' through the halls in my head, just tryna make sure it all makes sense
I ain't made of money, maybe some day you could take it from me?
I'm up too late, thinkin' bout you and M.I.A. for

And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
   Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killing left and right
Working through your worst night
   I hope the sack is full up
   I'm fuckin', no I'm fucked up
  Spend it when I get that
Can't nobody reach you
Did you call me from a séance?
You are from my past life
Always like the head first
   Hope you're doing well bruh
   Everybody needs you
   Oooh nani nani
   This feel like a quaalude
No sleep in my body
New beginnings ahh
The sun's going down
Know you need the money if you gon' survive

Wanna see nirvana, but don't want to die, yeah

  All my night
Still got some good nights memorized

Kept at least six discs in the changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
Couple bishops in the city building mansions
All the reverends
Preaching self made millionaire status
When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion
After 'trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
Stayin' with you when I didn't have a address
Fuckin on you when I didn't own a mattress
Working on a way to make it outta Texas
Every night
Droppin' baby off at home before my night shift

Want to see nirvana, but don't want to die yeah
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down

Why does the guy thing have to be so complicated?
I should’ve played it cool, instead I made a fool

And even if I always end up crying
Well, you can’t blame a girl for trying

No, you can’t blame a girl for trying
Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, no-oo.
I should’ve shut my mouth, I could’ve kept it quiet
I might have freaked him out ’cause I was so excited
But I just couldn’t wait, I took a leap of faith

I do stupid things when it comes to love
And even if I always end up crying

And maybe someday I’m gonna catch a shooting star falling out of the blue
Do what I do
And just as I’m giving up, my heart is palpitating
Here comes another one and it's so intoxicating
Being where I’ve been I know that in the end
I’ll do it all again

Toying somewhere between love and abuse
Calling to join them the wretched and joyful
Shaking the wings of their terrible youths
Freshly disowned in some frozen devotion
No more alone or myself could I be.
Looks like a strain to the arms it were open,
No shortage of sordid, no protest from me.
With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene.
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean,
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene.
Feeling more human and hooked on her flesh, 
I lay my heart down with the rest at her feet.
Fresh from the fields, all fetor and fertile,
Bloody and raw, but I swear it is sweet.
With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene.
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean,
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene.

And lease this confusion, I'll wander the concrete,
Wonder if better now having survived.
Jarring of judgement and reasons defeat,
The sweet heat of her breath in my mouth I'm alive.

Haven't you heard the rumours?
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds,
You made a fool out of me,
And, boy, you're bringing me down,
You made my heart melt,
Yet you're cold to the core,
But rumour has it I'm the one you're leaving her for,
Rumour has it,
Rumour has it, 
Rumour has it, 
Rumour has it, 
Rumour has it,
Rumour has it, 
Rumour has it, 
Rumour has it
     All of these words whispered in my ear,
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear,
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it,
People say crazy things,
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it,
Just 'cause you heard it,
Rumour has it,
Rumour has it,

Rumour has it,

Why it's taken me so long 
To let my doubts go 
You're the only one that I want 
I don't know why I'm scared 
I've been here before 
Every feeling  every word 
You'll never know if you never try 
To forget your past and simply be mine 
I dare you to let me be your  your one and only 
Promise I'm worthy 
To hold in your arms 
So come on and give me a chance 
To prove I am the one who can
walk that mile 
Until the end starts 
If I've been on your mind 
You hang on every word I say 
Lose yourself in time 
At the mention of my name 
Will I ever know 
how it feels to hold you close 
And have you tell me
 whichever road I choose  you'll go?
I don't know why I'm scared

Throw it all away

Sour apple baby, but you taste so sweet
You got hips like Jagger and two left feet
And I wonder if you'd like to meet
 Your voice is velvet through a telephone
You can come to mine, but both my roommates are home
Think I know a bar where they would leave us alone
And I wonder if you'd take it slow
 Oh, we're dancin' in my living room
 And I say I'm only playing but
 That I've never seen a mouth that I would kill to kiss
 And I'm terrified, but I can't resist
 Beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms and I know
 That beautiful strangers only come along to do me wrong
And I hope, beautiful stranger, here you are in my arms
But I think it's finally, finally, finally, finally, finally safe
 Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
 I grab your hand and then we run to the car
Singing in the street and playing air guitar
Stuck between my teeth just like a candy bar
And I wonder if it goes too far to say
 I've never recognized a purer face
You stopped me in my tracks and put me right in my place
Used to think that loving meant a painful chase
But you're right here now and I think you'll stay
 Oh, we're dancin' in my living room
 And I say I'm only playing but
 I've never seen a mouth that I would kill to kiss

If you could see my thoughts you would see your face is
Safe in my rental like an army truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more

No matter what I did
My waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then

Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you...meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then

We'll never be those kids again

I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Scream my name

So many lovely songs were waiting to be sung
So many wild pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my eyes refused to see

1,Yesterday When I Was Young (verÂ 2),Dusty Springfield,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/dusty-springfield/yesterday-when-i-was-young-chords-1827709,"Yesterday when I was young, 
the taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue.
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game,
the way the evening breeze may tease the candle flame.
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned,
I always built to last on weak and shifting sand.
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
and only now I see how the time ran away.
Yesterday when I was young,
so many lovely songs were waiting to be sung.
So many wild pleasures lay in store for me
and so much pain my eyes refused to see.
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out.
I never stopped to think what life was all about.
And every conversation that I can now recall
concerned itself with me and nothing else at all.
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
and every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died.
The friends I made all somehow seemed to slip away
and only now I'm left alone to end the play.
Oh, yesterday when I was young,
so many, many songs were waiting to be sung.
So many wild pleasures lay in store for me
and so much pain my eyes refused to see.
There are so many songs in me that won't be sung.
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue.
The time has come for me to pay for yesterday when I was young.

2,Papa,Tom Jones,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tom-jones/papa-chords-3678203,"Everyday my papa would work
To try to make ends meet
To see that we would eat
Keep those shoes upon my feet
And tuck me in my bed
Kiss me on my head
After all my prayers were said
And there were years
Of sadness and of tears
But through it all
Together we were strong
Times were rough
But Papa he was tough
Mama stood beside him all along
Growing up with them was easy
The time had flew on by
The years began to fly
They aged and so did I
And I could tell
That mama she wasn't well
Papa knew and deep down so did she
And when she died
Papa broke down and cried
All he said was, ""God, why her? Take me!""
Everyday he sat there sleeping in his rocking chair
He never went upstairs
Oh because she wasn't there
I'm proud of how you've grown
Go out there on your own
I'll be your right along
Places you must see""
His eyes were sad as he
Said goodbye to me
Papa's words ring true
Your children live through you
They'll grow and leave you too
Papa used to say
I see my kids and pray
They think of me
That way

I'd think by now you'd know
It would take forever to get you off my mind
If ever you decide to go
I guess i got a little insecurity
When it's concerning you
I guess i'm just afraid that if you ever leave
I'd be in a messed-up state of blue
And I'd be so lonely
Without you loving me
I know    it's gonna be lonely
Without you giving me every little single thing that i need
Lonely
Whatever's in your kiss, it really turns me on
Till I go right out of my mind
And who could ever resist your accent from Paris
It gets me every time
I betcha that you never knew that in my dreams
You are the star
The only bummer is that you always want to leave
Who do you think you are
Don't you know it's gonna be lonely
Without you loving me
I know    it's gonna be lonely
Without you giving me every little single thing that i need

We'd go boating on the Seine
And I would learn to dance
We lived in Ohio then
He worked in the mines
On his dreams like boats we knew
He would sail in time
In time
My sisters all grew up and went away
  To Denver and Cheyenne
Marrying their grownup dreams
The lilacs and the man
I stayed behind the youngest still
And I danced alone
Hoping that my father's dreams
Would someday take me home
Take me home
And I live in Paris now
  My children dance and sing
Wordâs of a miner's tongue

Bringing me sunshine, my heart has no fear
Birds in the air, they even sing your name
Spreading love's rainbows, an everlasting flame  ......Oh Lord
You make me... happy, baby
You make me feel real good
Yeah, yeah ... Oh baby
And so it may seem that my lifeâs a paradise
Oh, but youâre my sunshine that make things all right.....

Heavenly sunshine, only you can stop the rain
Pouring in my heart, and causing tears of pain
All of your feelin' seems to make me glow

You're my sunshine (You're my sunshine), loving you is my dream
When I'm with you (When I'm with you), I hear bluebells ring (Mm)
And the beauty only you can bring
Keep me smiling (Keep me smiling), my heart's filing
Away memories of a life with you
Take me with you, I'm the one who's
Gonna lift you to your shining star (Gonna lift you to your shining star)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

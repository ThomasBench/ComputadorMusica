Only in the mornings and evenings
Only when I wake up and sleep in
Oh my God
label, I don't
Say proceed with caution, but I won't
Guess I do it often, I know I'm already
gone
It's sad but true
I'd go to hell and back if I could go
there with you
What Do I Do?
Oh my God, I'm a fool
Keep on coming back to you
I'm so stupid for you
I'm so stupid for you
You're so bad for my health
But I just can't help myself
I'm so stupid for you
I'm so stupid for you
I have a list of all my habits, habits
Wish I didn't have it, so bad, it's
'Cause all of them are you
And the bad things that you do
Oh I wonder how you do it
Try to fight it off but it's useless
I'm so foolish, fooling around with you
It's sad but true
I'd go to hell and back if I could go
there with you
What Do I Do?
Oh my God, I'm a fool
Keep on coming back to you
I'm so stupid for you
I'm so stupid for you
You're so bad for my health
But I just can't help myself
I'm so stupid for you
I'm so stupid for you
I'm so stupid for you
For you, for you
I'm so stupid for you
For You, For You
Oh my God, I'm a fool
Keep on coming back to you
I'm so stupid for you

But I threw out my phone
And I burned all your clothes
And now I'm not alone
It's just me and your ghost
I got four red bottoms, up in flames at my place now
I burned three Chanel dresses, three words we don't say now
And it's hard not to drink when it's the one thing I think about
It's a lot of spiders in the attic, I don't mean to be dramatic
But I think it's kinda tragic who we magically became now

Yeah, tell me what I'm s'posed to do with all these pictures on my iPhone
Even all them videos only you and I know
You never cared about me, you just care about the likes, though
Every time you pop up, you should see my fuckin' eye roll
  I can't even kick it with the homies that we both know
I can't even fuck with any places that we used to go
Now all I got is just the memories of us though
Burn it all down to the ground with your ghost
I'm not alone, it's just me and your ghost
And this cripplin' depression
I thought I learned my lesson
But I threw out my phone
And I burned all your clothes
And now I'm not alone
It's just me and your ghost
Me and your ghost
Me and your ghost
Me and your ghost
Me and your ghost
I wish I could take back summer nights
Erase all the vibes
Leave the memories out to dry
Delete forever, no archive
Take the words you said to me
Hold on to them intentionally
I know that eventually
I'm not alone, it's just me and your ghost
And this cripplin' depression
I thought I learned my lesson

And I burned all your clothes

   Yeah, all my empathy's a disaster
   Feelin' somethin' like a scaly thing
   Wrapped too tightly 'round my own master
   My friends are gettin' bored of me
   Sayin' I fell in love with a stranger
   I don't know what they all think of me

   Remember anything but thinkin' you're the one
   And I can force a future like it's nothing
So I just hate everybody
Well, then why can't I go home without somebody?
And really, I could fall in love with anybody who don't want me
So I just keep sayin' I hate everybody
But maybe I, maybe I don't
   I know I've got a tendency
   To exaggerate what I'm seein'
   And I know that it's unfair of me
   To make a memory out of a feelin'
   It's 'cause I notice every single thing
   That's ever happening in the moment
   And I don't know why it's consumin' me
   Because honestly, all I know is
   Infatuation's observation with a cost
   But none of it is love, so while I'm waitin' for it
So I just hate everybody
Well, then why can't I go home without somebody?
And really, I could fall in love with anybody who don't want me
So I just keep sayin' I hate everybody
But maybe I, maybe I don't
If I could make you love me
Maybe you could make me love me
And if I can't make you love me
Then I'll just hate everybody

Even though I haven't touched you
Yeah, that's what love is
 That's what true love is
 Wouldn't want nobody else by my side
 Ooh, and you can trust me
After all the lies I told you
Yeah, that's what love is
 That's what true love is
 Don't nobody else deserve my time
 I reach out to you, but my hands can't hold enough
Enough of your greatness
 You teach me patience
 Like the best of our worlds collide
 Never understood what it meant
It meant to submit to love
 So beyond what lust is
 Hey, it's a blessing that you're in my life
 Make me look even better
When we shine, we shine together
Yeah, that's what love is
 Now, that's what love is
Don't nobody else deserve my eyes
 When you demand my presence, it's hard to read the message
I stay on the defense to take away your leverage
 'Til you put it in perspective
 Can't help but to respect it
Oh, now I know what love is
 I know what true love is
Yeah, down in my soul
 Far more than you know
 My self-esteem gets low
You lift it right up through the ceiling, woah
 Ooh, and I can feel you
Even though I haven't touched you
Yeah, that's what love is
 Now, that's what love is
 Wouldn't want nobody else by my side, no

  I'm living  someone else's life
  Suppressing  who I was inside

Time we lost will never be replaced
I'm the reason you forgot to love
So don't    be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
No, don't    be scared to live again

Did some things I couldn't let you see

We fell apart right from the start
 I used to pray when I was sixteen
 If I didn't make it then I'd probably make my wrist bleed
 Not to mislead turn my nightmares into big dreams
 Whole squad mobbin' even though we only six deep
 I was singing notes while my niggas played with six keys
 Walking in the snow before I ever made my wrist freeze
 I was blowing smoke, had me dizzy like Gillespie
 Niggas had no homes we were living in the dead streets
 You couldn't find me like I'm Hoffa
 Cover girls jumping out the page like they pop ups
 Spending all my money on these niggas that I brought up
Taking care of families for my brothers when they locked up
 And I had nothing to believe in
Double cup leanin', couldn't even breathe and
 For that money I was fiending
Cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving
 Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving
Leaving, Leaving into the night
She like my futuristic sounds in the new spaceship
Futuristic sex give her Phillip K dick
She never need a man, she what a man need
So I keep on falling for her daily
We was at Coachella going brazy
Stack a couple M's like I was Shady
Now I'm in Tribeca like I'm Jay-Z
Rockin' Sorayama like he pay me
I just signed a new deal with Mercedes
Got me movin' dirty like I'm Swayze
All my diamonds dancing like they Swayze
All my diamonds hitting like they Swae Lee
Jet so big got a business and a coach
Always livin' on the road, rockin' Louis a la mode, nigga
 And for that money I been fiending
Cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving
 Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving
Leaving, Leaving into the night
Twenty mill' mansion, never lived in it
Zero edge pool, never dipped in it
Superstar neighbor in my business
Paparazzi tryna catch me slippin' and
Going on tour is my vacation
Every month another accusation
Only thing I'm phobic of is failing
I was never blessed with any patience
 Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving
Leaving, Leaving into the night
You pillow talk to me about the men who try to get in between us
They buy you bags and jewelry, yeah

You just wanted my affection
You got me tattooed on your mind
You just want me all the time
We'll figure out our shit and find a way (Oh, yeah)
When you say that you need space, I give you space (You space)

Black on black venom colored seats
Keanu Reeves, the way a nigga speed
Diamond cross hangin' off of me

And it's slowly burning, it was never cheap
If you see what I seen, you wouldn't sleep
'Cause I got everything I wanted
Got the money, got the cars, got the ceiling with the stars
Got everything I wanted
But I'd be nothing without you
Gave you everything you wanted
Gave you power, gave you life, gave you space so you can shine
Gave you everything you wanted
But none of that matters to you, oh-oh
Well this place (This place) is never what it seems
Take me out, LA
Take me out of LA

To go back to my old ways, don't you cry for me
Thought I'd be a better man, but I lied to me and to you
I take half a Xan' and I still stay awake
All my demons wanna pull me to my grave
I choose Vegas if they offer heaven's gate
I tried to love, but you know I'd never stay
I'd never stay
But if I OD, I want you to OD right beside me
I want you to follow right behind me
I want you to hold me while I'm smiling
While I'm dying

Always blinded by the desert lights and
I'm alive when

You look so happy when I'm not with you
  But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eyes
  I don't know why I run away
  I'll make you cry when I run away
  You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
  But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care
  I don't know why I run away
  I'll make you cry when I run away
  Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
  Save your tears for another
  Save your tears for another day
   Save your tears for another day
So, I made you think that I would always stay
  I said some things that I should never say
  Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
  And now you won't love me for a second time
  I don't know why I run away
  I'll make you cry when I run away
  Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay

  And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day (Ooh, yeah)

   Without you goin' smooth (Fallin' in)
   'Cause my heart belongs to you
   I'll risk it all for you

   I'm fallin' in too deep, oh
   Without you, I'm asleep
   It's on me, only me, oh
My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself asleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
Never comin' through
I was running away from facin' reality
Wastin' all of my time on living my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
'Cause I want you, baby
I'll be livin' in Heaven when I'm inside of you
It was definitely a blessing, wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again, again
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart

I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah
   I know it's all my fault
   Made you put down your guard
   I know I made you fall
   I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (To you)
   Can't hide the truth, I stayed with her in spite of you
   You did some things that you regret, still right for you
   'Cause this house is not a home
W, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah
Without my baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
And I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, no
I can't move, I'm so paralyzed
I'm so paralyzed
And I can't explain why I'm terrified
I'm so terrified
Well, I don't wanna t ouch the sky no more
   I just wanna feel the ground when I'm coming down
    And I don't even wanna get high no more
I just want it out of my life
Out of my life, out
I wanna cut you outta my dreams
'Til I'm bleeding out
'Til I'm bleeding
I wanna cut you outta my mind now
'Til I'm bleeding out
'Til I'm bleeding
I wanna cut you outta my dreams
Woah, I'm bleeding out
Girl, I'm bleeding
I wanna cut you outta my mind
'Cause I'm bleeding out
Oh, I'm bleeding
Girl, I'm bleeding
    I keep telling myself I don't need it
    I keep telling myself I don't need it anymore
I keep telling myself I don't need it anymore

Non cambi mai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai
Ti sto pensando più dei soldi (cash), ah
A piedi nella mia via, le tue amiche parlano di me
La strada è difficile oggi, ah
Se ti chiedo di ballare, sembro uno sciocco, perché?
Tu, non ci verrai
Preferisci un Panamera o un Panerai?
Ti senti una ragazza cattiva, se lo fai
Il nostro cuore è buono, fuori non lo diresti
Io mi faccio incasinare dalle curve e dai gesti
Tu sei ovunque, fai perdere la testa
Io invece ho solo le collane, ah, ah-ah
Scheletri dentro l'iPhone
Il tuo sguardo resta nei miei ricordi
Mi sono rotta sai, di provare una nuova scossa
E poi, sentire quanto scotta
Ogni goccia d'acqua, sta sera è una lacrima
Tu che ne sai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai
Mi ferirai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai
(Lo sai) Io per te ho già perso la testa
Non riesco manco a respirare (Non cambi mai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai)
Il mio sguardo resta nei tuoi ricordi
Tu lo sai che ormai non sento niente, perché sento troppo
Non capisco mai mai, che quando è troppo è troppo
E ci spero sempre perché so che hai torto marcio
E ci spero finché non sarà di nuovo tutto morto
E mentre mi sporco di mascara queste guance
Piove, vorrei lavare via tutto come dentro il Gange
Ora lascia che sia il tempo a dirti se ho ragione
Lascia che sia tutto questo a consumarti le parole
Mi sono rotta sai, di provare una nuova scossa
E poi, sentire quanto scotta
Ogni goccia d'acqua, sta sera è una lacrima
Tu che ne sai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai
Mi ferirai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai
(Lo sai) Io per te ho già perso la testa
Non riesco manco a respirare (Non cambi mai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai)
Il mio sguardo resta nei tuoi ricordi
Yah, ti sto pensando più dei soldi (Più del cash, più del grano)
(più del cash, più del grano, più del cash, ehi)
La strada è difficile oggi (Più del cash, più del grano, più del cash, più del grano)
Se ti chiedo di ballare, tu non ci verrai
Il tuo sguardo resta nei miei ricordi
La fama non è tra le cose più care eh
Il mio nome è tatuato sulle altre
Se finisce, allora quanto è importante? eh
 La strada è difficile oggi (Lo sai)
Tu che ne sai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai
Mi ferirai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai

But I kept you beside me
  And if I held you back at least I held you close
Should have known you were lonely
I know things will never be the same
Time we lost will never be replaced
I'm the reason you forgot to love
So don't    be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
No, don't    be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
  You always miss the chance to fall for someone else
  'Cause your heart only knows me
  They try win your love, there was nothing left
  They just made you feel lonely (Hey)
  Well, I am not the man I used to be
Did some things I couldn't let you see
Refused to be the one to taint your heart
So don't    be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
No, don't    be scared to live again
Be scared to live again (Say)
I hope you know that (Oh), I hope you know that (Oh)
That I'll be praying that you find yourself
I hope you know that (Oh), I hope you know that (Oh)
We fell apart right from the start

 If I didn't make it then I'd probably make my wrist bleed
 Not to mislead turn my nightmares into big dreams
 Whole squad mobbin' even though we only six deep
 I was singing notes while my niggas played with six keys
 Walking in the snow before I ever made my wrist freeze
 I was blowing smoke, had me dizzy like Gillespie
 Niggas had no homes we were living in the dead streets
 You couldn't find me like I'm Hoffa
 Cover girls jumping out the page like they pop ups
 Spending all my money on these niggas that I brought up
Taking care of families for my brothers when they locked up
 And I had nothing to believe in
Double cup leanin', couldn't even breathe and
 For that money I was fiending
Cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving
 Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving
Leaving, Leaving into the night
She like my futuristic sounds in the new spaceship
Futuristic sex give her Phillip K dick
She never need a man, she what a man need
So I keep on falling for her daily
We was at Coachella going brazy
Stack a couple M's like I was Shady
Now I'm in Tribeca like I'm Jay-Z
Rockin' Sorayama like he pay me
I just signed a new deal with Mercedes
Got me movin' dirty like I'm Swayze
All my diamonds dancing like they Swayze
All my diamonds hitting like they Swae Lee
Jet so big got a business and a coach
Always livin' on the road, rockin' Louis a la mode, nigga
 And for that money I been fiending
Cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving
 Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving
Leaving, Leaving into the night
Twenty mill' mansion, never lived in it
Zero edge pool, never dipped in it
Superstar neighbor in my business
Paparazzi tryna catch me slippin' and
Going on tour is my vacation
Every month another accusation
Only thing I'm phobic of is failing
I was never blessed with any patience
 Leaving, leaving into the night

When he starts to miss his mum
Wouldn't it be lovely, to feel something for once?
Yeah wouldn't it be lovely, to feel worth something, huh?
  (Mmm, mmm)
  I know you can't let go, of anything at the moment
  Just know it won't hurt so
  Won't hurt so much forever
  Won't hurt so much
  Won't hurt so much
  Won't hurt so much
Charlie started seeing stars, so stuck on the new Jai Paul
Said ""my clothes are sticking to me and I can't quite see my walls""
Started dreaming of a house with red carnations by the windows
Where he didn't feel so small, so overwhelmed by all his flaws
  I know you can't let go, of anything at the moment
  Just know it won't hurt so
  Won't hurt so much forever
  Won't hurt so much
  Won't hurt so much
  Won't hurt so much forever
  I know you can't let go, of anything at the moment
  Just know it won't hurt so
  Won't hurt so much forever
  Won't hurt so much
  Won't hurt so much
  Won't hurt so much
  I know you can't let go, of anything at the moment
  Just know it won't hurt so
  Won't hurt so much forever
  Won't hurt so much
  Won't hurt so much

     A good one, you know when you lost one
     You go out and fuck different people to cope and ignore all precautions
     You drink and you drink and get faded, you feel like that's your only options (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
    And if it's too late, I understand
    Sometimes it's too late, to make amends
    Just hear me out - before - you let it go
    There is one thing, I need, for you to know
    Just don't have too much fun without me
    Don't have too much, don't have too much fun
    Please don't forget about me
    Try not to love no one
    Oh-oh, try not to love no one
    Yeah
    I know that that's too much to ask
    I know I'm a selfish bitch
    But I want you to know I've been working on it
    I know it don't matter
    I know it don't help you heal no fuckin' faster
    Yeah, I know
    I know I've been nothing short of a disaster (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
    Oh-oh-oh, woah
    And if it's too late (and if it's too late), I understand (I understand)
    Sometimes it's too late, to make amends (Oh woah, oh-oh)
    Just hear me out - before - you let it go
    There is one thing (one thing), I need (I need), for you to know
    Just don't have too much fun without me
    Don't have too much, don't have too much fun

Seasons keep on changin' as they do
Look what we got
A thickening plot
Just when I started getting used to
Of closing the book
There you were, in every nook
Of every word, every page
And now I wanna stay and wait, 'cause
Met every comma, every question mark
Bored of how all of the chapters start
But you feel like a brand new arc
That I never knew, oh
Like to think I know a thing or two
Like every day, the sky's a different blue
And then along came you, oh
Nothing stays the same and
Seasons keep on changin' as they do
Stories above concrete
X amount of heartbeats, so
Thank God for plot twists like you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Where have you been
All of my life?
It's all growin' dim now
That you've come to light
And who could've known, who would've thought
There was always gonna be you and I
Dancing barefoot in the open streets
Hangin' onto every word you speak
'Cause you keep me at the edge of my seat
Like to think I know a thing or two
Like every story ending's tried-and-true
And then along came you, oh
Nothing stays the same and
Seasons keep on changin' as they do
Stories above concrete
X amount of heartbeats, so
Thank God for plot twists like you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh (Who could've imagined)
Ooh (Who could've imagined you?)
Ooh (Who could've imagined)
Ooh (Who could've imagined you?)
Who could've imagined (Who could've imagined)
Who could've imagined you? (Who could've imagined)

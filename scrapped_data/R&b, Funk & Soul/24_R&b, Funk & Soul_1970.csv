It seems you've always had a prayer for me
When no one cared for me, you were so kind to.. me

1,Little Christmas Tree,Michael Jackson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/michael-jackson/little-christmas-tree-chords-3454940,"I watch the snowflakes fall
Against my window pane
And wonder if you
Are watching snowflakes, too
I take a walk downtown
To where you used to meet me
There's joy everywhere
But all that's waiting there is
Just a little Christmas tree
Looking sorta sad and lonely just like  me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve
I hear the Christmas bells (Bum Bum Bum)
The happy people singing
The songs of good cheer
That only brings me tears
I sadly close my eyes
And say a little prayer
You'll be waiting there for me
I look but all I see is
Just a little Christmas tree
Looking sorta sad and lonely just like  me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve
This is the season of love (This is the season of love)
But I'm as sad as I can be (But I'm as sad as can be)
Why did you have to leave me? (Why did you leave me? Why did you leave me?)
Just a little Christmas tree
Looking sorta sad and lonely just like  me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve

Perhaps he just got tired of making plans
And promises of things we never had
Well I done my best yet things got kind of rough
   But for me, my best was good enough, yes
I try to keep an open mind
That he would come to realize in time
But as I go from day to day
I tell myself that there's no other way
And perhaps he never understood
That I was only doing the best I could
Well, I wish him all the very best of luck

I'm talking to you you and you too

Those of you who go out and stay
Out all night camping till next day
And expect us to be home
When you get there
But let me tell you something
The sisters are not going for that no more
- Cause we realize two things;
That you aren't doing anything for us
We can do better by ourselves
So from now on we gonna use
What we got to get what we want
So you'd better
Think
It was the time when we haven't met?
That's the thing I never will forget
Now baby I got a life to live with whole lot loving
That a woman could give you, yeah
But before I give it up, I gotta think
Think...
... what the future holds for me
- Just go ahead and see
I don't need no heartache - I can't stand no misery
Let me think - think﻿
Don't say it's easy - Don't be a dog
Last night living - No time to talk
Come lay the cards on the table
You've come to take good care of me?
That's all I aim for
You may not call me true
But I won't do nothing - that you won't do
Yeah I won't do nothing - don't you ever...

Venice

There's a different attitude
On a many a summer evening
Found me searching   for the     fire
The elusive sea of childhood
Then became a one desire
There were places in the valley
Where they said that I could find it
There were rhythms in the distance
In the ancient elder forest
That is why I came to   California
It's the strangest groove that I have ever known
All the youth seekers come to California
Following the fountain in their mind
San Francisco
Catch a cable car to where your dreams go
There's a lot of make believe
San Diego
From LA you'll find out where your dreams flow
From the hillside to the desert
Following the map inside me
I can the feel the road is leading
To the treasure that will guide me
There were places in the valley
Where they said that I could find it
There were rhythms in the distance
In the ancient elder forest
That is why I came to   California
It's the  freeist groove that I have ever known
All the youth seekers come to California
Following the fountain in their mind
In their mind
Zuma
Oh I'd like to walk the beach on Zuma
Watching all those pretty girls
Venice
It gets really strange going through Venice
There's a different attitude
That is why I came to   California
It's the  freeist groove that I have ever known
All the youth seekers come to California
Following the fountain in their mind
That is why I came to   California
It's the  freeist groove that I have ever known
All the youth seekers come to California
Following the fountain in their mind

45,In The Ghetto,Candi Staton,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/candi-staton/in-the-ghetto-chords-4135933,"As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago morn, a poor little baby child is born
 In the ghetto (in the ghetto) and his mama cries (ooh'ooh)
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need, is another little hungry mouth to feed
 In the ghetto (in the ghetto)
People, don't you understand, the child needs a helpin' hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me, are we too blind to see?
Or do we simply turn our heads and look the other way?
 Well, the world turns (ooh'ooh)
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose, plays in the street as the cold wind blows
 In the ghetto (in the ghetto) and his hunger burns (ooh'ooh)
So he starts to roam the street at night, he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight
 In the ghetto (in the ghetto)
And then one night in desperation, a young man breaks away
He buys a gun, steals a car, tries to run, but he don't get far
 And his mama cries (ooh'ooh)
As a crowd gathers round an angry young man, face down in the street, with a gun in his hand
 In the ghetto (in the ghetto) and as her young man dies (ooh'ooh)
On a cold and grey Chicago morn, another little baby child is born
In the ghetto'o.. (in the ghetto..) and his mama cries (in the ghetto..)

In the evenin' on a Friday night
A little light a-shinin' through the window
Lets me know everything's alright
Summer breeze, makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze, makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
See the paper layin' on the sidewalk
A little music from the house next door
So I walked on up to the doorstep
Through the screen and across the floor
Summer breeze, makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze, makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
Sweet days of summer, the jasmine's in bloom
July is dressed up and playing her tune
When I come home from a hard day's work
And you're waiting there, not a care in the world
See the smile a-waitin' in the kitchen
Food cookin' and the plates for two
See the arms that reach out to hold me
In the evening when the day is through
Summer breeze, makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze, makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze, makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze, makes me feel fine
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze, summer love
Summer breeze, summer love

47,Choo Choo Chboogie,Louis Jordan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/louis-jordan/choo-choo-chboogie-chords-4180915,"Headin' for the station with a pack on my back
I'm tired of transportation in the back of a hack
I love to hear the rhythm of the clickety-clack
And hear the lonesome whistle, see the smoke from the stack
And pal around with democratic fellas named Mac
So take me right back to the track, Jack
Woo-woo, woo-woo ch'boogie
Choo-choo, choo-choo ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track, Jack
You reach your destination, but alas and alack
You need some compensation to get back in the black
You take a morning paper from the top of the stack
And read the situations from the front to the back
The only job that's open needs a man with a knack
So put it right back in the rack, Jack
Woo-woo, woo-woo ch'boogie
Choo-choo, choo-choo ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track, Jack
Gonna settle down by the railroad track
Live the life of Riley in the beaten down shack
So when I hear a whistle, I can peep through the crack
And watch the train a-rollin' when it's ballin' the jack
Well, I just love the rhythm of the clickety-clack
So take me right back to the track, Jack
Woo-woo, woo-woo ch'boogie
Choo-choo, choo-choo ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track, Jack
Take me right back to the track, Jack

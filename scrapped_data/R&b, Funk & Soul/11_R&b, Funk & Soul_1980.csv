You got me cryin' like I thought I would never be 
How can I love you when you ain't around 
Get to the morning and you never call 
Love should be everything or not at all 
And it don't matter what ever you do 
I made a life out of lovin' you 
Only to find any dream that I follow is dying 
I'm cryin' in the rain 
I could be searchin' my world for a love…….. everlasting 
Feeling no pain, when will we meet again 
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker 
Is it a lesson that I never knew 
Gotta get out of the spell that I'm under 
My love for you 
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker 
When I was bein' what you want me to be 
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by 
This world may end 
Not you and I 
My love is stronger than the universe 
My soul is cryin' for you 
You made the rules and you could not see
You made a life out of hurtin' me 
Out of my mind , I am held by the power of you love 
Tell me when do we try 
Or should we say goodbye 
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker 
When I was bein' what you want me to be 
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by

I’ll make you a career in the business I’m in
I’ll make you rich, I’ll make you a toy
I’ll make you turn over into my little boy
Y’see I’m going somewhere
I don’t know what I’m gonna do when I get there
I know money’s a thing - your only inspiration
And your only meaning
You must think that all I do
Is spend my time making pretty pictures of you
You can fall when I will climb
But I’ll be falling over just by having you in my mind
Mend that fight – oh listen to them
Kickin’ up a ball inside a jericho wall
Mend that fight – it’s all twisted through them
If you ain’t rich then you won’t go to the ball
Having mercy and licking up love
And moving through your ocean like I’ve never had enough
Y’see you ain’t all I want
You’re everything and more that I have ever hoped for
You must think that all I do
Is spend my time making pretty pictures of you
You can fall when I will climb
But I’ll be falling over just by having you in my mind
Mend that fight – oh listen to them
Kickin’ up a ball inside a jericho wall
Mend that fight – it’s all twisted through them
I’m rich, you ain’t, so you won’t go to the ball
You won’t go to the ball
You won’t go to the ball
You won’t go, you won’t go
You won’t go to the ball [Repeat Chorus]
You must think that all I do
Is spend my time making pretty pictures of you
You can fall when I will climb
But I’ll be falling over just by having you in my mind
Mend that fight – oh listen to them
Kickin’ up a ball outside a no. 10 wall
Mend that fight – it’s all twisted through them
I’m rich, you ain’t, so you won’t go to the ball, No more!
You won’t go to the ball
You won’t go to the ball
You won’t go, you won’t go
You won’t go to the ball [Repeat Chorus]
You won't go to the ball (Yeah, if you ain’t got nothing)
You won't go to the ball
You won’t go, you won’t go (You’ll never go there)
You won’t go to the ball [Repeat Chorus]
I tried to make you see
I tell you I’d had enough
Money was a thing, money was a thing
Money was a thing that I believed in [repeat]

The treasures at the rainbow's end

Out in the world, bright burned the fire, through every door,  he was so sure
Than he ran into a problem, he heard the voice inside him say
Do you believe that what you have is what you need
You can't blame Louis,     Oh, Louis
He found a girl, his heart's desire, she was the first, she quenched the thirst
His social whirl, did not inspire, her life divine, soon lost its shine
Now he's counting every hour, wondering where she spent the night
She doesn't show, it seems he'll never know
You can't blame Louis,     Oh, Louis
You can't blame Louis,     Oh, Louis
Take a day and trace a thought to where it all began, remembering how you felt at every turn
Even thought reality was not part of the plan, by reaching out you lit the spark forever
Louis thought he'd find the answer, in a world that has no soul
He moved on, to learn another song
You can't blame Louis,     Oh, Louis
You can't blame Louis,     Oh, Louis
You can't blame Louis,     Oh, Louis

Then we tried to be as gentle as we could be
And after I had kissed her and quickly walked away
She followed me outside and called to me
She said, ""Daddy, please tell me""
Her eyes so filled with tears she could not see
""Now that you've stopped loving mommy
Does it mean that you've stopped loving me""
And the words she uttered cut right through me
And I realized what she must be going through
To know that those two people whose love had brought her life
Were strangers and there was nothing she could do
And I knew that my words of reassurance
Would be the most important words I'd ever say
So I tenderly and lovingly put my arms around her
And I asked my god to please show me the way
I said, ""Honey, your mom and I both love you
Much more than you could ever really know
And the love that she and I had for each other
Still lives in you and with the years will grow
And don't ever think that just because I'm leaving

And all its sad goodbyes.

I know you're not a fool.
I should have known better than to cheat a friend, 
And waste the chance that I've been given.
So I'm never gonna dance again,
The way I danced with you whoo hoo - oh yeah
Time can never mend,
The careless whispers of a good friend.

Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth, 
Pain is all you'll find.

Guilty feet have got no rhythm.
Though it's easy to pretend,
I know you're not a fool.
I should have known better than to cheat a friend, 
And waste the chance that I've been given.
So I'm never gonna dance again,
The way I danced with you whoo hoo - oh yeah
Tonight the music seems so loud, 
I wish that we could lose the crowd.
Maybe it's better this way, 
We hurt each other with the things we want to say.
We could have been so good together, 
We could have made this dance forever... 
But now, who's gonna dance with me?
I'm never gonna dance again, 
Guilty feet have got no rhythm.
Though it's easy to pretend,
I know you're not a fool.
I should have known better than to cheat a friend, 
And waste the chance that I've been given.
So I'm never gonna dance again,
The way I danced with you whoo hoo - oh yeah
(Now that you're gone... Now that you're gone...) 
(Now that you're gone...) Was what I did so wrong?
So wrong that you had to leave me alone?

 Wanna run away and hide

Anyone can make mistakes
And we both have made our share
But a life without your love
Is a life too hard to bear
  I don't care who's right or wrong
   Only know I love you so
 Why did I have to write this song?

Why in all the wide,  wide world
Have I run into you here
Wish I could disappear
I'll never understand
Why I even give a damn

I've built so many walls around me
Now the walls are tumbling down
You're the kind I can't forget

Whichever lonely road I take
It seems to go nowhere
It's a fight to survive just until tomorrow
How can I display what I know I'm worthy of
When they turn me away
The doors are closed to such as I
A boy from nowhere
But not to those who merely buy the right to go where
They'll be met with respect, not humiliation
A man's place on earth
I have come to realize is decided by birth
No matter where I go
I will still belong in Andalusia
Where we don't know where
The next penny's coming from
Something's wrong
I'm bound to Spain, I won't remain
A boy from nowhere
There has to be a place for me
And I must go there
I don't fantasize, unlike a million others
Who must bow and scrape
For my one means of escape
Is to flourish a cape
I'll fight all odds
And fight the Gods if they oppose me
I have to win, I won't give in
No one who knows me would expect me to fail
For the want of trying
Not a man alive
Had to beg or steal or fight
More than me to survive
So what's the future
No matter where I go
I will still belong in Andalusia
Where good, honest men grow weak
And the rich grow strong
Something's wrong
Another dawn, another boy
A boy from nowhere
My destiny will guarantee
And I must go there
It's a fight to survive just until tomorrow
One more mouth to feed
And the way things are 'round here
That's the last thing they need

47,Therell Be Sad Songs,Billy Ocean,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/billy-ocean/therell-be-sad-songs-chords-1847991,"  Sometimes I wonder by the look in your eyes
  When I'm standing beside you there's a fever burning deep inside
  Is there another in your memory? 
  Do you think of that someone when you hear that special melody?
  I always stop and think of you especially
  When the words of love song touch the very heart of me
  There'll be sad songs to make you cry  love songs often do
  They can touch the heart of someone new  saying I love you
  I love you
  I often wonder how it could be, you loving me, two hearts in perfect harmony
  I'll count the hours until that day, the rhapsody plays a melody for you and me
  Until the moment that you give your love to me
  You're the one I care for the one that I will wait for
  There'll be sad songs to make you cry  love songs often do
  They can touch the heart of someone new  saying I love you, ohhh
  There'll be sad songs to make you cry  love songs often do
  They can touch the heart of someone new   saying I love you 
  Ooh ooh ooh,  aahh
  You're my desire, you take me higher
  My love is like a river running so deep
  I always stop and think of you especially
  When the words of love song touch the very heart of me
  There'll be sad songs to make you cry  love songs often do
  They can touch the heart of someone new  saying I love you, ohhh
  There'll be sad songs to make you cry  love songs often do
  They can touch the heart of someone new   saying I love you 
  Do do do do do do do do.... ooh 
 Saying I love you (Spoken) I love you

You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (yeah, yeah)
Too low to get under (yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (yeah, yeah)
Too low to get under (yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (yeah, yeah)
I took my baby to the doctor
With a fever, but nothing he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always tryin' 
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', lyin'
Sayin' you just wanna be startin' somethin'
You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always tryin' 
To keep my baby cryin'
Treacherous, cunnin', declinin'
You got my baby cryin'
You're a vegetable, you're a vegetable
Still they hate you, you're a vegetable
You're just a buffet, you're a vegetable
They eat off of you, you're a vegetable
Billie Jean is always talkin'
When nobody else is talkin'
Tellin' lies and rubbin' shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', spyin'
Sayin' you just wanna be startin' somethin'
You're a vegetable, you're a vegetable
Still they hate you, you're a vegetable
You're just a buffet, you're a vegetable
They eat off of you, you're a vegetable, aow!
If you can't feed your baby (yeah, yeah)
Then don't have a baby (yeah, yeah)
And don't think maybe (yeah, yeah)
If you can't feed your baby (yeah, yeah)
You'll be always tryin'
To stop that child from cryin'
Hustlin', stealin', lyin'
Now baby's slowly dyin'
Lift your head up high
And scream out to the world
I know I am someone
And let the truth unfurl
No one can hurt you now
Because you know what's true
Yes, I believe in me
So you believe in you, help me sing it
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, ma ma coo sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma coo sa

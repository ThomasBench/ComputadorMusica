We're like a song that just ain't groovin'

Baby baby, this ain't gonna work
Ooh            baby,    this ain't gonna work
baby baby, this ain't gonna work
Girl we've got to make some changes
We share the same bed, but we're living like strangers
Oh and sure we get by
But if it ain't true, then we're livin',    we are livin'a lie girl
Oh if it's up to you and me then why aren't we dancing
Oh I wish the powers that  be would work in our way
But that ain't like it is today

And I guess that I don't love you anymore

Now I'm missing you & I'm wishing that you would come back through my door 
Why did you have to go? You could have let me know so now I'm all alone,  
Girl you could have stayed but you wouldn’t give me a chance 
With you not around it's a little bit more than I can stand 
And all my tears they keep running down my face why did you turn away? 
So why does your pride make you run and hide? 
Are you that afraid of me?  
But I know it's a lie what you keep inside 
This is not how you want it to be 
So baby I will wait for you ‘cause I don't know what else I can do 
Don't tell me I ran out of time.  If it takes the rest of my life 
Baby I will wait for you.  If you think I'm fine it just ain’t true 
I really need you in my life.  No matter what I have to do I'll wait for you 
It's been a long time since you called me (How could you forget about me) 
You gotta be feeling crazy (crazy) 
How can you walk away, everything stays the same 
I just can't do it baby 
What will it take to make you come back?  Girl I told you what it is & it just ain't like that. 
Why can't you look at me, you’re still in love with me?  Don't leave me crying. 
Baby why can't we just start over again 
Get it back to the way it was 
If you give me a chance I can love you right 
But you’re telling me it wont be enough 
Baby I will wait for you.  Baby I will wait for you.  If it's the last thing I do. 
I'll Be Waiting.

She speaks the lines that can control my mind
Where ever she goes i know my eyes follow
She blew a kiss, i swear that it was meant
Only for me, then spoke with her body
Her only goal is to take control
and I can't believe i can't tell her no.

caring about you, and start being without you
But I'll find a way
to go and start doin' without you and stop talkin' about you.

No one to trust, on my own, I was lonely.
You suddenly appeared. It was cloudy before, now it's all clear.
You took away the fear. And you brought me back to the light.
You are the sun, you make me shine. More like the stars, that twinkle at night.
You are the moon, close in my heart. You're my daytime my nighttime, my world.
You are my life.
Now, I wake up every day. With this smile upon my face.
No more tears, no more pain. Cos you love me.
You help me understand, that love is the answer to all that I am.
I, I'm a better man. Since you taught me by sharing your life.
You gave me strength, when I was destroyed.
You gave me hope when all hope was lost.
You opened my eyes, when I couldn't see.
Love is always here waiting for me.
You are the sun, you make me shine. More like the stars, that twinkle at night.

What do we know?
Life has to have a meaning
Show me the light
Show me the way
Show that you're listening
Show me that you love me
Show me that you walk with me
Hopefully, just above me
Heaven's watching over me
Guess it's funny how I say thanks to you
For all you've given me
Sometimes the price of what you gave to me
I can't stop questioning
O God of love, peace, and mercy
Why so much suffering?
I pray for the world, it gets worse to me
Wonder if you're listening
When people go
Why do they go?
Why don't you choose me?
But someday I know
I'm gonna go
I hope you're waiting for me
Show me that you love me
Show me that you walk with me
Hopefully, just above me
Heaven's watching over me
Maybe we'll talk
Some other night
Right now I'll take it easy
Won't spent my time
Waiting to die
Enjoy the life I'm living
Show me that you love me
Show me that you walk with me
Hopefully, just above me
Heaven's watching over me

oh no
I'll write a song
But I've never had someone to sing about
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Now that I know what true love means
She wants to breathe
She wants to know how love's supposed to be
She belongs right here with me
I'll make her fall, make her believe
I just had to write a song about her
Tell her I would build my world around her

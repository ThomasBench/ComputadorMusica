3,Front Line,Stevie Wonder,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/stevie-wonder/front-line-chords-3941012," I am a veteran  of the war
 I up and joined the army back in nineteen sixty four
 At sixteen I just had to be a man at any cost
 I volunteered for Vietnam where I got my leg shot off
 I recall a quote from a movie that said who's more a man
 Than a man with a reason that's worth dying for
 They had me stan-ding on the front  li-ne
 They had me stan-ding on the front  li-ne
 They had me stan-ding on the front  li-ne, but now I stand at the
Back of the line when it comes to getting a-head
 They gave me a uniform and a tiny salty pill
 To stop the big urge I might have for the wrong kind of thrill
 They put a gun in my hand and said, shoot until he's dead
 But it's hard to kill when 'please, I'm your friend' echoes through your head
Brought up in church taught no man should take another's life
But then put in a jungle where life has no price
 They had me stan-ding on the front  li-ne
 They had me stan-ding on the front  li-ne
 They had me stan-ding on the front  li-ne, but now I stand at the
Back of the line when it comes to getting a-head
 Back in the world the paper reads to-day
 Another war is in the brewing
 But what about the lives of yester-day and the
Many happy families that have been ruined
 My niece is a hooker and my nephew's a junkie too
 But they say I have no right to tell them how they should do
 They laugh and say quit bragging 'bout the war you should never have been in
 But my mind is so brain-washed I'd probably go back and do it again
 I walk the neighborhood par-ading my purple heart
 With a fear of agent orange that no one will stop
 They had me stan-ding on the front  li-ne
 They had me stan-ding on the front  li-ne
 They had me stan-ding on the front  li-ne, but now I stand at the
Back of the line when it comes to getting a-head
 They had me stan-ding on the front  li-ne
 They had me stan-ding on the front  li-ne
 They had me stan-ding on the front  li-ne, but now I stand at the
Back of the line when it comes to getting a-head
 They had me stan-ding on the front  li-ne
 They had me stan-ding on the front  li-ne
 They had me stan-ding on the front  li-ne, but now I stand at the
Back of the line when it comes to getting a-head

Conquer the room with a touch of perfume

Gotta let it show, for it to last

Make it romantic, make it up I don't care
Look up and sigh even if it's a lie

What charm could sway me
Then burn and betray me
But thrill me the way that you do
Second to none, so completely undone

Straighten your gown throw a Manhattan down

Do you think that I can't see?
There's no doubt, not a trace

Feel the pressure, your back's against the wall
Love is gaining on you, you're just about to fall
If you're afraid to love, afraid to take a chance
You'd better hide your feelings, get out while you can
Cause you'll be going loco down in Acapulco, if you stay too long

The magic down there is so strong
 You'll be pulling out your hair, drowning in despair
With a whole lot of nothing on your way to nowhere
Your search for paradise will come to an end
When you realize what a fool you've been
You'll be haunted by her face, missing her warm embrace
 Memories of loving her, holding her tight every night
Was that the best, part of your life?
Hearing her voice soft and low, begging you to please, please don't go
Don't go-o-o no..!  Don't go!   Don't go!
 You can hear voices bleeding through those warm Latin nights
 Memories of lost and found, leaving broken hearts all over town (all over town)

And it's good when I can finally make it home

While she lays dreamin'
I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says, ""How was your night?""
And I go to her and say, ""It was all right""
And I hold her tight
And she believes in me
I'll never know just what she sees in me

I could change the world with my little songs

And she has faith in me
And so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night

I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Waiting for me like a secret friend
And there's no end
While she lays cryin'
I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through oh
And she believes in me

I told her someday if she was my girl
I could change the world with my little songs

And she has faith in me

Will he ever notice me
Could he ever fall
Tell me teddy bear
Why love is so unfair
Will I ever find a way 
An answer to my prayer

There's something I think that you should know.
It's not that I shouldn't really love you,
Let's take it slow.
When we get to know each other,
And we're both feeling much stronger.
Then let's try to talk it over,
Let's wait awhile longer.
Let's wait awhile,
Before it's too late.
Let's wait awhile,
Before we go      too far.
Remember that special night,
When all of the stars were shining bright?
We made our first endeavor
To stay together.
We made our very first promise,
To love, to share and be real honest.
But on that very first night,
It wasn't quite right.
Let's wait awhile,
     Before it's too late.
Let's wait awhile,
    Our love will deepen.
Let's wait awhile,
Before we go      too far.
I didn't really know,
Not to let all my feelings show.
To save some for later,
So our love can be greater.
You said you would always love me,
Remember I said the same thing too.
You don't have to be frightened with my love,
Because I'll never give up on you.
    Let's wait awhile,
       Before it's too late.
     You know you can't rush love,
Love.
Let's wait awhile,
    Before it's too late.
Let's wait awhile,
    Our love will deepen.
Let's wait awhile,
Before we go    too  far.
Ah,       oh look.
Let's wait awhile,
    Before it's too late.
Let's wait awhile,
    Our love will deepen.
Let's wait awhile,
Before we go    too  far.
Oh.

    Da la dat da dat da la.
La da da lay dat da dat da dee dee,
    Da la dat da dat da la.
La da da lay dat da dat da dee dee,

     I'll be worth the wait.

With all the sweetest dreams and promises of paradise.
But that face was gone  when the dawn would come and steal you.
Yet I still could feel you waiting just a kiss away.
I'd surely  know your face, your love would cast a spell.
I'd recognize each curve and line of you, I knew it well.
Now at last you're here and I can tell.
Something in your eyes I see,
Is all I ever wanted,
And something in your smile for me is calling out my name.
Your eyes, it seems,
Are mirrors of my dreams,
In ways I can't explain.
And my heart will never be the same.
We never said a word, as if we'd always known.
But through the bittersweet of waiting we were not alone.
Now we're close enough for the touch of love to find us.
Fantasies designed us but they never really could,
Begin to measure you, no pictures ever do.
And as I watch you framed the sunlight in a sky of blue,
I know what my life's been leading to.
Something in your eyes I see,
Is all I ever wanted,
And something in your smile for me is calling out my name.
Your eyes, it seems,
Are mirrors of my dreams,
In ways I can't explain.
And my heart will never be the same.

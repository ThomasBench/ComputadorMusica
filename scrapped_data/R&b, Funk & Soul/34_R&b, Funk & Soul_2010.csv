1,The Letter,Kehlani,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/kehlani/the-letter-chords-1855758,"I can hear your laugh
It's ringing through the hallways
I can see your smile
It's what gets me through my hard days
And your words was suppose 
To get me through my heartache, 
Before my heartbreak
  There's an emptiness that only few ever feel
The meaning of love that is real
And it compliments my scars that will never heal
Maybe I didn't deserve you
Maybe I just couldn't cure you
They told me that I didn't hurt you
Why do I feel like I turned you?
Maybe I don't understand it
Tell me is this how you planned it?
Did you see us so stranded
Maybe I'm to much too manage
And if you weren't gonna guide me
Why bring me into the light?
Must have done something 
To make you want to run and hide
Why oh why didn't you just live your life?
  And every girl needs a mother
And damn it I needed you
And you ran from the truth
And like kids do
You waited around for proof
Maybe I didn't deserve you
Maybe I just couldn't cure you
They told me that I didn't hurt you

I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet, to go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing
Hello,   can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times 
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried 
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello,   how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope  that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us are running out of time
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times 
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried 
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

10,Here (ver 3),Alessia Cara,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/alessia-cara/here-chords-2608680,"              I guess right now you've got the last laugh
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or, I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can, go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to
And I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Hours later, congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here
Oh I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

Now I'm terrified to face it on my own
You're not there
To celebrate the man that you made
You're not there
To share in my success and mistakes
Is it fair?
You'll never know the person I'll be
You're not there
With me
    Though I know that you're not there
I still write you all these songs
It's like, you still got the right to know what's going on
   As I struggle to remember how you used to look and sound
Sometimes I still think i can spot you in the crowd
Every step I take, you used to lead the way
Now I'm terrified to face it on my own
You're not there
To celebrate the man that you made
You're not there
To share in my success and mistakes
Is it fair?
You'll never know the person I'll be
You're not there
With me
Time can heal your wounds if
You're strong and standing tall
I've been doing all of that, it didn't help at all
They say ""You'll grow older, and it'll get better still""
Yes, I will, but no it won't
They don't get it, cause
You're not there
To celebrate the man that you made
You're not there
To share in my success and mistakes
Is it fair?
You'll never know the person I'll be
You're not there

Boys working on empty
Is that the kinda way to face the burning heat
I just think about my baby
I’m so full of love I can barely eat
There’s nothing sweeter than my baby
I never want once from the cherry tree
Cause my baby’s sweet as can be
She gives me toothaches just from kissing me
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I’ll crawl home to her
That's when my baby found me
I was three days on a drunken sin
I woke with her walls around me
Nothin' in her room but an empty crib
And I was burnin' up a fever
I didn't care much how long I lived
But I swear I thought I dreamed her
She never asked me once about the wrong I did
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I’ll crawl home to her
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I’ll crawl home to her
My baby never fret none
About what my hands and my body done
If the Lord don't forgive me
I'd still have my baby and my babe would have me
When I was kissing on my baby
And she put her love down soft and sweet
In the lowland plot I was free
Heaven and hell were words to me
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I’ll crawl home to her
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down

42,Missed,Ella Henderson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ella-henderson/missed-chords-1691857,"You think you're missed,
Well let me tell you this,
The love I felt for you,
Has flown away
And now you see,
What have you done to me
So all I can ask is why, why, why,
You made us feel like one,
I should've known you were wrong,
Oh yeah, you did it on your own,
Now you got to go,
Oh no, I won't let you bring me down,
Your tried to hurt my feelings,
You stopped me dreaming,
But here I draw the line,
I wish you luck in life and goodbye
You let me think
That you were so so true
Loose light truth can lie
You want me to go from a high straight down to a low
But all excuses hear the reasons that are everywhere
Chase your rainbows can before
Been chasing you for so long
Oh yeah, you did it on your own,
Now you got to go,
Oh no, I won't let you bring me down,
Your tried to hurt my feelings,
You stopped me dreaming,
But here I draw the line,
I wish you luck in life and goodbye

Laisse tomber les filles
Laisse tomber les filles
Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera
Laisse tomber les filles
Laisse tomber les filles
Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera
Oui j'ai pleuré mais ce jour là
Non, je ne pleurerai pas
Non, je ne pleurerai pas
Oui j'ai pleuré mais ce jour là
Non, je ne pleurerai pas
Non, je ne pleurerai pas
I guess you had no idea that you could have persuaded me
Girl, you could have had me doing anything you pleased
Girl, you should have took your time and thought of what to say to me
'Cuz I'm not as hard as I make it seem to be
It could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
'Cuz ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone
So if I said that I won't call
The lying comes natural to me
You could have been that lonely star
If we just went on
If we just went on
If we just went on
If we just went on
Happiness exists when you don't know a thing
So I hope you don't think this song is about you
And only I can know how close you came
Baby I'm a pro at letting go
I love when they come and go
Laisse tomber les filles
Laisse tomber les filles
Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera
Laisse tomber les filles
Laisse tomber les filles
Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera
Oui j'ai pleuré mais ce jour là
Non, je ne pleurerai pas
Non, je ne pleurerai pas
Oui j'ai pleuré mais ce jour là
Non, je ne pleurerai pas
Non, je ne pleurerai pas

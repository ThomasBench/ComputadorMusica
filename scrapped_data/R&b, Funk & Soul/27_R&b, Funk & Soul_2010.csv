0,Mirrors (ver 4),Justin Timberlake,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/justin-timberlake/mirrors-chords-1229133,"Aren't you somethin' to admire, cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice, you reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and the glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always parallel on the other side
Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass, I'm here tryin' to pull you through
You just gotta be strong
Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you baby, it was easy
Comin' back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
(oh oh) My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
(oh oh) With anyone else beside of me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making two reflections into one
Cause it's like you're my mirror
(oh oh) My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
Aren't you somethin' an original cause it doesn't seem really as simple
And I can't help but stare cause I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you, you reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I would look at us all the time
Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass, I'm here tryin' to pull you through
You just gotta be strong

        Tomorrow's a mystery

Keep your eyes on me, baby, keep your eyes on me

Baby you're the inspiration of this precious song
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone
And I can't wait wait wait wait wait to get you home
Girl you're my reflection,    all I see is you
My reflection,   in everything I do
You're my reflection   and all I see is you

2,Higgs,Frank Ocean,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/frank-ocean/higgs-chords-1936899,"   Saturdays involved making our entrances into life outside
We've been in this room too long
Recreation is keeping us self contained and aware
   Of each other's form
Still and in full strides just the same
Keeping us warm
Walking in straight lines
Talking to sleep at night
Our versions of mothers
It's all new to me
It's all new to me
It's all new to me
Having you around the Higgs...
   What if we decide to live by choice
  All this time I knew
That average was something to fall back on
After genius ends
I watch video only difference is
It's flattened and remiss sparks of lightning storm
Slip my pants back on
And rewind it backward more
The tape stopped before I was back alone
   I'll be back before
 The street lights on, before the daylight's gone
I was spoiled by lavish thoughts
They don't compare, no not at all
  And had this been the past I might not know
What to do with all
Of what you've showed
What you give, my words can’t hold
And if acts of God
Breaks us apart
 Least we did ours
Turn back, turn back
Turn back, turn
    If you never    been in love

Lockjaw jigsaw
Betting on an outlaw

4,Fire On The Floor,Beth Hart,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/beth-hart/fire-on-the-floor-chords-2545365,"  Love is a fever
  And is burning me alive
  It can't be tamed or satisfied
  There is no mercy
  For the fallen or for the weak
  Love is a nasty word to speak.
I don't wanna love him anymore
He's nothing like the man I loved before
  But the pain gets real comfortable
  When it's all ya got.
Ashes and smoke they can't compete
Not even hell can take the heat
  And I be sliding off of my seat
For his flame.            His love is like
Fire on the floor
It's got me running for the door
But I'll be crawling back for more
Of his fire on the floor
It don't matter what ya say
You can't survive it, there ain't no way
So tonight I'm gonna stay
And play with his fire
On the floor
Wanna play with his fire
On the floor child, child.
  This kinda love
  Don't need no bed or satin sheets
  Nothing soft,   nothing soft or sweet to drink
  Love is a lesson,   you were born to never learn
  And your soul will beg to burn
I don't wanna love him anymore
He's nothing like the man I loved before
And there's a sign above the door
Saying no way out.
Ashes and smoke they can't compete
Not even hell can take the heat
  And I be sliding off of my seat
For his flame.

Fire on the floor
It's got me running for the door
But I'll be crawling back for more
Of his fire on the floor

Feel your kiss against my lips and now

Still can't seem to tell you why it
Hurts me everytime I see you
I realize how much I need you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her you need her
And I'll never be her
I miss you when I can't sleep or
Right after coffee or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat still got
Sand in my sweaters from nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart too, and I'm
Always tired but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this real out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text but then I never mind that shit
I got these feelings but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me but your friends don't know
If you wanted me you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go
I don't mean no harm I just
Miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we coulda been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone I guess
This is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong so
Every lonely night, I sing this song
I hate you I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you I love you

Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care u never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah all alone I watch you watch her
She's the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me

I made a few mistakes
I did it to myself
I'm the only one to blame

  I disappeared last night,
  While sleeping in my bed,
  A field of lavender beneath my head,
  Another planet,
  I'll try to map it,
  No user interface,
  It won't escape me again,
  And if I sleep tonight,
  The cosmic radiation,
  I won't complain.
  Maybe I can find the right,
  Frequency and station,
  I might just stay.
  Don't wake up.
  I'll be here for centuries,
  Sweet magnetic energy,
  Nothing quite like this,
  Ever has existed,
  But God knows how I missed it.
  Gravity is losing it's hold,
  Ho oh oh old.
  I can feel it fading,
  Gravity is losing it's hold,
  Ho oh oh old.
  I can feel it fading,
  Gravity is fading.
  I float on endlessly, 
  Senses eluding me,
  There's no horizon to this open sea.
  Now that I'm giving it another chance,
  Giving luck a chance,
  I'll find something someday.
  And if I sleep tonight,

So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well, if they really made me then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever ""son"" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never making money
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pulling up in Aventadors
Just know we been grinding on them sidewalks

They don't ever lie

They showed me all the signs
They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down

Say, say, say We hung all summer, sprung mattress with bae bae
Say, say, say Trippin' off Dyke, and my name strike with pay day
Say, say, say Flippin' blue lightning, tightening, strapped with AK
Say, say, say OG one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
How to segue pussy, power, profit in headache
I reminisce my life innocence or life innocent or life intimate, with fame
Like when repent like when we women up gon' get it, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy, the sun and the moon and star, boy
Astronomer, anonymous, I line 'em up, grind 'em up, there's nine of us
And five of us are probably fucked, she mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head (head), head, head, more head (head)
Oh God, bless the dead (yah), I'm livin' life, high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed I'm the greatest nigga, why you so scared to say it?

Said she's found another lover in another city
Said she's doing fine in New Orleans
Now she got me pacing, huh, wondering where'd I go wrong
Got me going in circles like the merry-go-round
Gonna take the west train to Louisiana in the morning
Sweet little girl from the ninth ward of New Orleans
Up under that red dress are legs long as the bayou trees
She got a golden smile, I know she's the one for me in the room
She's a-twistin' and a-groovin', shakin' and a-movin'
She don't know what she doin' to me, I
Love the way that you dance, and honey, I've got a question:
Baby, would you be my queen?
All right now
Her name was Eartha was her name, I could never forget
Honey was movin' with ease, each and every step
So good that baby had my eyes at her glow
No shiny jewelry, still the brightest thing illuminatin' the room
That girl is twistin' and a-groovin', shakin' and a-movin'

Was she attractive,
Was she an actress,
Baby the fact is,
You’re hear’in rumours about me, and saw some pictures online,
Say’in they got you so angry, mak’in you wish were burned,
Before we start talk’in crazy, say’in some things you’ll regret,
Can’t we just slow it down, and press reset…you’re beautiful,
So please don’t judge me, and I won’t judge ya,
Coz it could get ugly, before it gets beautiful
So please don’t judge me, and I won’t judge ya,
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful, 
Just let the past, just be the past,
And focus on things, that are gonna make us laugh,

A million reasons why I should have,
And it makes no sense,
So here I am,

Stopping for green lights, and Now I know,

Promise that you'll keep my love with ya

And I didn't have much of that
But you were so quick to reject me

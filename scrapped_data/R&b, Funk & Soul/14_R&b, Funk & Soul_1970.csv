0,If I Ever See You Again,Roberta Flack,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/roberta-flack/if-i-ever-see-you-again-chords-3765551," 1 fret higher
I've wondered all my life
 How I could ever let you go
 There's not a lot of change in my life
But one thing that I know
 If ever I see you again
Maybe this time
it well work out alright
 Maybe this time we won't say goodbye
 but only goodnight
With a love that won't end
 If ever I see you again
Warm sleepy mornin waking up next to you
Feeling you close by my side
Nothing on earth has ever felt better
Then the feelings I've felt deep inside
Sometimes it seems that I never lost you
 And that your not really gone
Cause I had this dream
This wonderful dream
 It just goes on and on
 And If ever I see you again
 Maybe this time it well work out alright
 Maybe this we won't say goodbye
 but only goodnight with a love that won't end
If ever I see again

3,Keep On Keeping On,Curtis Mayfield,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/curtis-mayfield/keep-on-keeping-on-chords-76232,"Everybody gather round and listen to my song,
I've only got one.
We who are young, should now take a stand,
Don't run from the burdens of women and men,
Continue to give, continue to live
For what you know is right.
Most of your life can be out of sight,
Withdraw from the darkness and look to the light;
Where everyone's free, 'least that's the way it's
Supposed to be.
And we just keep on keeping on
We just keep on keeping on
Many think that we have blown it
But they too will soon admit
That there's still a lot of love among us
And there's still a lot of faith and warmth and trust.
When we keep on keeping on.
Before we dismiss, one thing I insist
When you have your young, remember this song,
And our world surrounding, its leaps and and bounds,
Ups and downs, is reality
Teach them to be strong, and when they are grown,
They can proudly imply that we were an alright guy,
For all the wrong now is right and this nations people united
As one.
And we just keep on keeping on
We just keep on keeping on
Many think that we have blown it
But they too will soon admit
That there's still a lot of love among us
And there's still a lot of faith and warmth and trust
When we keep on keeping on.
We're gonna move on up y'all.

dove adesso è il mio berretto lì la camera da letto,
in direzione dello stagno
costruiremo il nostro bagno
Entra pure è la tua casa,
la tua casa fra le rose,
ora appena prendo il mese
il primo muro, la tua casa te lo giuro .
Ora siediti qui
dove ci sarà il camino pensa a quando tutta quella gente
pur passandoci vicino non vedrà più niente
quella porta no, non è un sogno,
è robusta è di legno
non nascondere la mano,
non nascondere il tuo seno
ora non c’è più nessuno, più nessuno
ora non c’è più nessuno… mmmh…

Stendo a terra il telo
Ora alza gli occhi al cielo e dimmi quanto mancherà al tramonto
Ci vuol buio a questo punto, voglio farti tenerezza
la tristezza si dissolve come fumo
resta solo il tuo profumo
il profumo delle pelle
lo sfondo delle stelle
quel vago senso di dolore
che scompare col respiro
col respiro del tuo amore
… mmh mmh mmh mmmmh…

There was a girl named Mary Anne
And Mary Anne meant all the world to me
We planned to get married
We set the date the wedding was to be
But I walked up to her house one night
And out there on the front porch they sat
And then I swore he'd never get away with that
Billie Joe took Mary Anne and went up to the dance hall one night
They didn't know that I was standing back there in the shadows out of sight
They sat down at a table and she smiled as he gave her hand the pat
And then I swore he'd never get away with that
I swore he'd never get away with breaking my heart
I knew that there was just one way to keep them apart
Everybody says his mother begged him
Not to take his guns to town
He should have listened to her
She knew that I was gonna shoot him down
I'll be hung tomorrow just because I had to kill that little rat
But I swore he'd never get away with that
And Billie Joe didn't get away with that

You knew that I was shy, so you teased and made me cry.
 But I loved you...
 Then one day you came, you told me you were leaving,
You gave your folks the blame and made me cry a-gain.
 When you said...
 Little girl, please don't wait for me,
Wait patiently for love, some-day will surely come.
 Little girl, please don't wait for me,
Wait patiently for love, some-day will surely come.
And I'm still wait-ing.

 I'm just a fool, I'm just a fool).
 (I'm just a fool, I'm just a fool to keep waiting,
 I'm just a fool, I'm just a fool).
Then someone finally came; he told me that he loved me,
I put him off with lies; he could see I had no eyes.
 So he left me...
 Once again, a-lone like a child without her playmate,
I had to face the truth; I was still in love with you.
 But you said...
 Little girl, please don't wait for me,
Wait patiently for love, some-day will surely come.
 Little girl, please don't wait for me,
Wait patiently for love, some-day will surely come.
And I'm still wait-ing.
 Love has never shown his face,
 Since the day you walked out that door.
 You filled my life with empty space,
 Come back; can't you see it's you, I'm waiting for?

We all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow
Please swallow your pride
If by your faith you need to borrow
I´m right up the road
and I´ll share your load
If you just call me
Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need
Somebody to lean on
You just call on me, brother, when you need a hand

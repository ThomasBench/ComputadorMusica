0,Fool For You,Zayn,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/zayn/fool-for-you-chords-1829180,"This love is tainted
I need you and I hate it
You're caught between a dream and a movie scene
In a way, you know what I mean
When the darts just miss, I just can't resist it
Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do
Cause I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do
The things you do, the things you do
When you're looking like this
I just can't resist it
I know sometimes I hide it
But I can't this time cause it's gonna defeat me
But if you won't believe me, believe me
Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do
Cause I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do
The things you do, the things you do
I know, I know given the chance I'd do it again
Cause I can't help myself
Cause I can't stop myself
I just love being a fool for you
Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do
Cause I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do
The things you do, the things you do
This love is tainted

Did faith let me down
Or did I not have enough?
That distinction is tough
Still, I thought your hands
Protected me from the fall
Did you mean that at all?

Was it even you I listened to?

Don't know when my feet last touched the ground

A rolling stone,  nowhere feels like home
And I've seen people come, then they go
Life is just a story of some highs and some lows
Tell me do you believe in miracles?
I'm standing here before your eyes
I've cried many rivers
I've walked through some pain
I've seen my world crumble
And I'll carry the shame
But I know somebody, He calls me His own
I can hear heaven singing out
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Oh-oh-oh, you're never alone
Everybody wants to be king
We put all our hope inside material things
In Your light I now understand
That everything I have ain't everything that I am
Oh, sometimes I feel like I'm not good enough
But that's when love says you're mine
I've cried many rivers
I've walked through some pain
I've seen my world crumble
And I'll carry the shame
But I know somebody, He calls me His own

My imperfections were a part of Your plan
And if all things work together in the end
The broken will be beautiful
There's not a hole too deep
That God's love is not deeper still
You've come too far to give up now
Let's go!

Alarms are struck and shore is shook by sheer atrocity
A cure I know that soothes the soul, does so impossibly
A moment's silence when my baby puts their mouth on
Me and my babe relax and catch the manic rhapsody
All reason flown, as God looks on in abject apathy
A squall and all of me is a prayer in perfect piety
A moment's silence when my baby puts their mouth on me
When the meaning's gone, there is clarity
And the reason comes on the common tongue of your lovin' me
And it's easy done, our little remedy
And the reason comes on the common tongue of your lovin' me
What yields the need for those who lead us oh so morally
Those that would view the same we do through their deformity
Who view the deed as power's creed, as pure authority
This moment's silence when my baby puts their mouth on me
Since it all begun, to it's reckoning
There the reason comes on the common tongue of your lovin' me
Be thankful some know it lovingly
There the reason comes on the common tongue of your lovin' me
Like a heathen clung to the homily
Let the reason come on the common tongue of your lovin' me
So summon on the pearl rosary
Let the reason come on the common tongue of your lovin' me

Heavy tears, a rain parade from hell (from hell)

Falling, falling, but I never thought you'd leave me

You can reach me if you wanna
Stay up tonight
Stay up at night

I'm no good with names and faces
She sent me naked pictures
From her neck down to the waist
I get my feelings involved
She stopped returnin' my calls
Flaws turned into walls and barricades
And I'm too fare gone and over both ways
And now every long day is a bad one
I can't make you call or make you stay
Or take you off the pedestal
So I get lost in modern music watchin' movies
Talkin' to the walls in my room
Walkin' through the halls in my head
Just tryna make sure it all makes sense
I ain't made of money
Maybe someday you could take it from me
I'm up too late
Thinkin' bout you

I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say ""I love you"" through the phone tonight
Really don’t wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain’t no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight
Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby, I can’t really miss you if I’m with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It’s like I'm the universe and you'll be N-A-S-A
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I’ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star, space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space (N-A-S-A)

Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time
Usually, I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine, soon as them stars align, mm-mm-mm mm-mm
Baby, I can’t really miss you if I’m with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It’s like I'm the universe and you'll be N-A-S-A

I swear there's something in the wind outside today
And it ain't cool
Got me thinking 'bout how things decay
And about you
But I'll be fine, I have to set delay
Before I try to fall in love, not pain
Yes, I'll be fine, I just can't rush
Not again, not again, no, not again
Fuck, why is falling in love so hard?
I think I'm just moving too quickly
Based on the patterns I've been studying on myself
Of the most scientific research and I think
That I should just take things a little slower
You know, I've learned a lot in experience
You know, I'm grateful to be in this place right now, ayy
I swear there's something 'bout a loss there is to gain
Perhaps a lesson
If you do it once, don't do it again
Unless it's destined, oh
But I'll be fine, I have to set delay
Before I try to fall in love, not pain
Yes, I'll be fine, I just can't rush
Not again, not again, no, not again

She calls me crying every day 'cause they got problems
He likes complaining, she's compromising
Coming to me for real advice when he just playing
I can tell she loves him way too deep
He loves being fucking hard to please
Cover the basics, it's pretty easy
He's a bitch with some expectations
Did you go down on his birthday? (Yup)
Did you let him leave a necklace? (Yup)
Or did you show him all your crazy? (No)

Did you give in to his ego

We're like mosquitoes to light, in a sense
I feed off bioluminescence
  Love and intent
   So it's a quick fix
What else does life have to give but the pain
Generated inside our own brains?
   It's a sick game, yeah
Submit to me, come get down on one knee
I'm your savior and I'll give you everything that you need
Submit to me, come get down on one knee
I'm your savior and I'll give you everything that you need
   Blaspheming the spirit
I just don't want to hear it, too deep
What I've sown I'll continue to reap
   I'll earn my keep
   It was all good intentions
Did I forget to mention? My God
Just tryna get money with my dogs
   Is that so wrong?
Submit to me, come get down on one knee
I'm your savior and I'll give you everything that you need
Submit to me, come get down on one knee
I'm your savior and I'll give you everything that you need
Lately you been on a wave
   Seen you lit up in the place
Sometimes you're sad, I see it on your face
   I can tell you're not okay
I know you're only seeking out the beauty
  In fulfilling your duty
   The answers it seems
   Are inside your own dreams
   Good God, Jehovah, what's this I see?
   My mortality's staring back at me
   Niggas think I'm scared
   But I ain't come prepared and I ain't know what this is
   I've slept like Jacob, a rock for a pillow
   Run swift like Elijah, away from the middle
   Seen the world, overindulged maybe a little
   But now your boy's up, and I'm fit as a fiddle
   Oh Lord, Jehovah, what's this I see?
   Bourgeoisie tryna silence me
   They don't know what I've been through
   Seeing shit that you see up in your TV screen
Follow me to salvation
Your mind still 'pon plantations
The shepherd, holds information
It gives it out as its taken
  Yeah, yeah

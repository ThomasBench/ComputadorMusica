 Avec des mots, je peins..... des images....
  Sortie de ma cage, monté d'un étage
 Aujourd'hui, je plane dans les nuages
     Je laisse la vie m'emporter ; je laisse ma plume me porter,
 C'est pas si facile de tourner la page.
  Quand le présent m'échappe et que le passé me traque
 Je soupire pour dire dommage
  Je m'arrête un moment, juste pour une chanson
 Je rattrape le temps volage
     Et je laisse la vie m'emporter ; je laisse ma plume me porter
 Mes joies et mes peines
  Je laisse la vie m'emporter ; je laisse ma plume me porter
 J'attends cette vague qui m'appelle
 Pour pardonner les mots muets, le temps coule dans le sablier
 Pour oublier, ne pas plier, j'avance sans savoir où je vais.
 J'essaie de tourner la page ; j'essaie de tourner la page
 J'essaie de tourner la page ;     j'essaie de tourner la page
 J'essaie de tourner la page ; j'essaie de tourner la page
 Ivre comme un poète,    libre comme une mouette,
 J'accompagne les solitaires au large
 Dans un océan de rêves, sous le beau temps ou l'orage,
 Je dépose mon ombre et je nage
  Je laisse la vie m'emporter ; je laisse ma plume me porter,
 C'est pas si facile de tourner la page.
 A ceux qui m'écoutent et qui d’eux-mêmes sont otages,
 J'écris pour vous dire courage.
 A ceux qui m'écoutent, même lorsque je doute
 Je chante « merci, je vous aime », quand je suis lâche
  Et je laisse la vie m'emporter ; je laisse ma plume me porter
 Mes joies et mes peines
  Je laisse la vie m'emporter ; je laisse ma plume me porter
 J'attends cette vague qui m'appelle
 Pour pardonner les mots muets, le temps coule dans le sablier
 Pour oublier, ne pas plier, j'avance sans savoir où je vais.
 J'essaie de tourner la page ; j'essaie de tourner la page
 J'essaie de tourner la page ;     j'essaie de tourner la page

I recognize what you mean to me
And all the corners of our pictures
Are a long time frayed
They still symbolize what you mean to me
You ask me to remember
  A kiss is but a kiss
  Like I'd be a fool to want more from you
  And I'm gone in a while
  I'll be gone in a while
  I'll be gone in a while
  It's all that I do
And I'll cry and you cry and we'll cry
Untill the rain turns black
  And the devil moon and clings to us
And for a moment there is beauty, with you
Oh it's not a simple yearning woman
Sometimes it feels like it's all I've got
And I ask you to remember
A kiss is but a kiss
  That you'd be a fool to want more from me
  And I'm gone in a while

He gave me candy,
I came back for more
I asked for his name 
He said call me J for James
He was 6'2 lots of style 
He had the recipe to make you smile
But he got too popular with the girls
So I erased him from my world
The next boy was cute and shy
But he never really looked me in the eye
Secretive I was intrigued
He was sweet, his name was Pete (Sweet Pete)
First time that he took me out,
I didn't know what to talk about
So I took the initiative
And told Pete he had to leave
So I'm back to square one
With Mr. Good For Nothing John
Ever since he brought me down,
I can't get off the ground
It's not like I don't try,
And I'm pretty easy on the eye
But the one I really crave,
Is the one that got away
With each boy he gets worse,
But I'm still stuck on the first
Really hate to say,
I want the one that got away
 He's the star of the football team,
Can be found in every girl's dream
We've been talking for a while,
You could say that he's on trial
But whenever we're alone,
Your jaw's like a gramophone, cause
When he goes off the field,
With him goes his appeal
So I'm back to square one
With Mr. Good For Nothing John
Ever since he brought me down,
I can't get off the ground
It's not like I don't try,
And I'm pretty easy on the eye
But the one I really crave,
Is the one that got away
With each boy he gets worse,
But I'm still stuck on the first
Really hate to say,
I want the one that got away
Here she goes again,
With another boy on her hands
Word goes around
Real fast in this small town
All these rumors like I'm a stark,
Just wanna find someone to give my heart
No luck with James, Pete or the football stud
None of them can compare
None of them can compare
To my John
It's not like I don't try,
And I'm pretty easy on the eye
But the one I really crave,
Is the one that got away
With each boy he gets worse,
But I'm still stuck on the first
Really hate to say,
I want the one that got away
I want the one that got away

But I'm catching feelings
doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo catching feelings
doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
  In my head, we're already together
  I'm good alone, but with you I'm better
I just want to see you smile
Just say the word and I'll be right there
I ain't never going nowhere
  I'm just tryna see where this can take us
Cause everything about you, girl, is so contagious
I think I finally got it down
And all that's left to do now is get out the mirror
And say it to her, yeah
Could it be a possibility
I'm tryna see what's up
Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby now is time for us
Tryna keep it all together
But enough is enough

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
  Should I tell her how I really feel
Or should I move in close or just be still
Cause if I take a chance and I touch her hand
Will everything change
How do I know, if she feels the same
Could it be a possibility
I'm tryna see what's up
Cause I'm made for you, and you for me
Baby now is time for us
Tryna keep it all together

I look around for desire, love run away
Hold back, we're falling down, and I show you how it breaks
If I can give it, I'll take it, all of the way
And I've got a lot left to learn, babe
You're nobody 'til somebody loves you
It's hard times when nobody wants you
Fill up my cup, don't ever stop coming
Get up on top, I'll make it pop, honey
You're nobody 'til somebody loves you
It's a cold heart, when nobody holds you
Fill up my cup, don't ever stop coming
Get up on top, I'll make it pop, honey

I don't want to see that
Look at all the stones they keep on throwing
I don't want to feel that
Like Sun that will keep on burning

Im a soldier at war
I have broken down walls

In the oceans of me
I defined

My recovery
And I can hear the choirs keep on singing
Tell me what they’re saying
And I can hear the phone It keeps on ringing
I don’t want to answer
I know that I used to listen
And I know I’ve become dismissive
In my recovery

Hiding in bed since ‘cause no one around disagrees

And I feel romantic and since morning I’ve been acting wild

Shall we eat all the poison and leave all the questions behind?

Just stay with me
And I never wanna lose you but I feel that this closeness will tear us apart

It's like an addiction
Hit me with your best shot honey
I've got no reason to doubt you
'Cause certain things hurt
And you're my only virtue
And I'm virtually yours
And you keep coming back, coming back again
Keep running round, running round, running round my head
And there's certain things that I adore
And there's certain things that I ignore
But I'm certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours

It's when you get angry
You have me at your mercy

Still coming down, dripping throat

is a space, that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along

I couldn't get any bigger

Aren't you somethin', an original, cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare cause I see truth somewhere in your eyes

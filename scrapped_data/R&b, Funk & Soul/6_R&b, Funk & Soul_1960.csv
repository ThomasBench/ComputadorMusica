I knew that you felt it too..by the look in your eyes..
Sweeter than wine.
Softer than a summer night.
Everything I want I have, whenever I hold you tight..
This magic moment..while your lips are close to mine,
will last forever..forever till the end of time.
Whoa..whoa..oh..oh.......Whoa..whoa..oh, oh..

I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Loooord it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
You're the key to my piece of mind
Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Til your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful
Of what I'm living for
And if I make you happy I don't need to do more
Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)
Oh, baby what you done to me
You make me feel so good inside
And I just wanna be
Close to you you make me feel so alive
Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman (woman)

And nobody calls you on the phone.
Ah, don't you feel like crying? 
Don't you feel like crying? Like crying? Like crying?
Come on, baby, cry to me. 
When you're all alone in your lonely room,
And there's nothing but the smell of her perfume.
Ah, don't you feel like crying?
Don't you feel like crying? like crying? like crying?
Come on, baby, come on...cry to me. 
Well, nothing could be sadder than a glass of wine, alone.
Loneliness, loneliness, it's just a waste of your time.
You don't ever, you don't ever have to walk alone, you see.
So, come on, take my hand..Come on, walk with me.
When you're waiting for a voice to come, in the night,
and there is no one..
Ah, don't you feel like crying? 
Don't you feel like crying? Like crying? Like crying?
Come on, baby, cry to me.(Last 3 lines x 3.)

Do we simply turn our head

Well, the world turns.

plays in the street as the cold wind blows
in the ghetto.

so he starts to roam the streets at night
and he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight
in the ghetto.
Then one night in desperation
the young man breaks away.
He buys a gun, steals a car,
tries to run, but he don't get far,
and his mama cries.

When the mountain was high, I still believed
When the valley was low, it didn't stop me, no no

I wanna go home..I wanna go home.
Oh, how I wanna go home.
Home folks think I`m big in Detroit City.
From the letters that I write, they think I`m just fine.
But by day, I make the cars, and by night, I make the bars.
If only they could read between the lines.
Cause you know I rode a freight train north,
to Detroit City.
And after all these years I find, I`ve just been 
wasting my time.
You know what I`m gonna do?..I`m gonna take my foolish pride,
get it on a southbound freight and let it ride.
I`m gonna go back to the loved ones..the ones that I left

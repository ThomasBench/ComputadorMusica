But I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But listen baby, what can I do, yeah

but the love you gave, you took away from me.
Foolishly, I believed in you.
What a fool I was, thinking love was true.
Selfishly you broke my heart.
You really had me fooling from the start.
Still I have just one regret :
although you're gone, I can't forget.
Why when the love is gone,
why does my heart keep holding on ?
Oh why when the love is gone,
Tell me why does my heart keep holding on ?
Your love was sweet when it started
but now I find it leaves me broken hearted.
Why do you swear to always care
then walk away and leave me in despair ?
Selfishly ...

You just keep me hanging on,

You just keep me hanging on!

You still want to be just friends,
        But how can we still be friends,
When seeing you only breaks my heart again?
    And there ain't nothing I can do about it!
Woh - oo, woh -oo, love,

But your heart and soul needs to be free,
        And now that you've got your freedom,
You want to still hold on to me,

So let me find somebody else...hey-hey!
    Why don't you be a man about it,
      And set me free?
Now   ...you don't care a thing about me,

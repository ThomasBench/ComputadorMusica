It's not unusual to have fun with anyone

If you should ever want to be loved by anyone
It's not unusual it happens every day
No matter what you say
You'll find it happens all the time
Love will never do
What you want it to
Why can't this crazy love be mine

It's not unusual to find out I'm in love with you

The loneliness from being apart
Opened up our eyes
To the love that was always there
Deep inside

And we can't make it alone
We're closer together more now then ever
For now that we've found love
We've got to hold on love

We'll never regain
But together we'll fill the hours that remain
The loneliness we have known
We'll push behind
Together forever
We'll make up for all lost time

Nothing can do us harm
Nothing can shake us
Nothing can break us
We'll be together

So my love gets stronger day by day
Your love I'd leave behind
If I better love I could find
But you're still on my mind day by day
Write to her I know I should
Speak to her I wish I could
But I'm missunderstood day by day
Don't you ever leave me this I say
Soon you're gone I need me come what may
My love is deep inside so don't you ever
Hurt my bad
This love I cannot hide day by day

At least that's the way the story goes
Frankie bought everything for Johnny
From his sports car to his Ivy League clothes
Aw, he was a man alright
Oh, but he was doing her wrong
Just to show you what can happen
A friend came running to Frankie
She said you know I wouldn't tell you no lie
I saw your man ridin' in his Jaguar
With a chick named Nellie Blye
Oh, if he was your man honey
Let me tell you he was doing you wrong
Let me tell the story
Frankie ran around the corner
And peeked in a swinging place
And there she saw Johnny with a woman
He had his arms around her waist
Aw...he was a man alright
But Frankie could see that he was
Doing her wrong
And oh let me tell you
Frankie reached down in her pocketbook
And up with a long forty-four
She shot once, twice, three times
And Johnny fell on the hard wood floor
Aw...he was a man alright
But she shot him because he was doing her wrong
But the last thing he told her was
Frankie, you know I love you
Why? Honey, why did you do that?
Frankie, I was telling her about you
Frankie, you know I love you
Frankie, you know that I love you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Now Frankie, you know good and well that I love you
Frankie, I'll always love you baby
Frankie, you know I can't do without you
Frankie, you know I love you
And I know, and I know I was doing you wrong

Before you break my heart
Baby baby, I'm aware of where you go
Each time you leave my door
I watch you walk down the street
Knowing your other love you'll meet
But this time before you run to her
Leaving me alone and hurt
(Think it over) After I've been good to you!
(Think it over) After I've been sweet to you!
Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over
I've known of your, your secluded nights
I've even seen her, maybe once or twice
But is her sweet expression
Worth more than my love and affection?
This time before you leave my arms
And rush off to her charms
(Think it over) Haven't I been good to you?
(Think it over) Haven't I been sweet to you?
Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart
Think it over
Think it over
I've tried so hard, hard to be patient
Hoping you'll stop this infatuation
But each time you are together
I'm so afraid I'll be losing you forever
Stop! In the name of love
Before you break my heart (Baby, think it over)
Stop! In the name of love (Think it over, baby)
Before you break my heart (Ooh, think it over, baby)

Down south of Babylon
So why don't you just fade away

I've been healing
I've been dealing
A crooked game
Thieving pirates
I'm thieving pirates
Out of gold
That they stole from the queen
Stole from a man
Whose favorite hand
Is one that he will always land
Well I'm building 
Us a levee
By the Mississippi
For I'll die in an unmarked grave

or did I dive at your delight?

and I cannot disguise my love
there is no time
and I wouldn't know how

I have no fear

In the middle of the night and you're fast asleep, my love.
Stay awake looking at your beauty,
Telling myself I'm the luckiest man alive.
Cause so many times I was certain you was gonna walk out of my life
Why you take such a hold of me girl,
When I'm still trying to get my act right.
What is the reason, when you really could have any man you want,
I don't see, what I have to offer.
I should've been a season, guess you could see I had potential.
Do you know you're my Miracle?
I'm like a statue, stuck staring right at you,
Got me frozen in my tracks so amazed how you take me back,
Each and everytime our love collapsed
Statue, stuck staring right at you,
So when I'm lost for words,
Everytime I disappoint you, It's just cause I can't believe,
That you're so beautiful 
Don't wanna lose you, no 
Ask myself why are you even with me,
After all the shit I put you through,
Why did you make It hard, It's like you're living and I make you,
But baby your love is so warm It makes my shield melt down,
And everytime were both at war, You make me come around
What is the reason, when you really could have any man you want,
I don't see, what I have to offer.
I should've been a season, guess you could see I had potential.
Do you know you're my Miracle?
I'm like a statue, stuck staring right at you,
Got me frozen in my tracks so amazed how you take me back,
Each and everytime our love collapsed
Statue, stuck staring right at you,
So when I'm lost for words,
Everytime I disappoint you, It's just cause I can't believe,
That you're so beautiful 
Don't wanna lose you, no 
That you're so beautiful 
Don't wanna lose you, never
   Every single day of my life I thank my lucky stars,
   God really had to spend extra time when he sculptured your heart
   Cause there's no explanation, can't solve the equation
It's like you love me more than I love myself.
I'm like a statue, stuck staring right at you,
Got me frozen in my tracks so amazed how you take me back,
Each and everytime our love collapsed
Statue, stuck staring right at you,
So when I'm lost for words,
Everytime I disappoint you, It's just cause I can't believe,
That you're so beautiful 
Don't wanna lose you, no 
That you're so beautiful 
Don't wanna lose you, never.....

No trouble stayin' occupied

I was delayed, I was way-laid
An emergency stop
I smelt the last ten seconds of life
I crashed down on the crossbar
And the pain was enough to make
A shy, bald, buddhist reflect
And plan a mass murder
Who said I'd lie to her?
Who said I lied because I never? Never!
Who said I lied because I never.
I was detained, I was restrained
And broke my knee
(And then he really laced into me yeah)
Friday night in Out-patients
Who said I lied to her?
Who said I lied? - because I never, I never
Who said I lied to her?
So I drank one
It became four
And when I fell on the floor ...
...I drank more
Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've
Heard this one before
Stop me, oh, stop me
Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before
Nothing's changed
I still love you, oh, I still love you
...Only slightly, only slightly less than I used to, my love
Set free me why don't you
Get out my life why don't you
Cause you don't really love me, no
You just keep my hanging on
Set me free why don't you babe
Get out my life why don't you babe
Cause you don't really love me, no, no, no
You just keep my hanging on.

And if I am a reflection of him then I must be fly Because his light it shines so bright I wouldn't lie
I remember the very first day that I saw him
I found myself immediately intrigued by him
It's almost like I knew this man from another life
Like back then maybe I was his husband maybe he was my wife
And even,things I don't like about him are fine with me
Cause it's not hard for me to understand him cause he's so much like me
And it's truly my pleasure to share his company
And I know that it's God's gift to breathe
Cause he is the truth, said he is so real
And I love the way that he makes me feel
How can the same man that makes me so mad
Turn right around and kiss me so soft
If he ever left me I wouldn't even be sad no
Cause there's a blessin' in every lesson
And I'm glad that I knew him at all
Cause he is the truth, said he is so real
And I love the way that he makes me feel
And if I am a reflection of him then I must be fly Because his light it shines so bright I wouldn't lie
I love the way he speaks
I love the way he thinks
I love the way that he treats his mama
I love that gap in between his teeth
I love him in every way that a woman can love a man
From personal to universal but most of all
It's unconditional
That's the way I feel
And I always will-(Spoken)
There ain't no substitute for the truth
Either it is or isn't
You see the truth it needs no proof
Either it is or it isn't
Now you know the truth by the way it feels
And if I am a reflection of him then I must be fly
Because he is, yes he is

I'd play a song that would never, ever end. How I'd love, love love, to
dance with my father again.
When I and my mother would disagree, to get my way I'd run from her to him
just what my mama said
Later that night when I was asleep, he left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he would be gone from me

One final step, one final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never, ever end
cause i'd love my mother to dance with my father
again
Sometimes I'd listen outside her door, and I'd hear how my mother
cried for him.
I'd pray for her even more than me, I'd pray for her even more than me

But could You send back the only man she loved

I like it-like it 
Feels so good being bad (Oh oh oh oh oh) 
There's no way I'm turning back (Oh oh oh oh oh) 
Now the pain is my pleasure cause nothing could measure (Oh oh oh oh oh) 
Love is great, love is fine (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Out the box, outta line (Oh oh oh oh oh) 
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it 
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones 
But chains and whips excite me
Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it 
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones 
But chains and whips excite me
Na-na-na come on come on come on

Oh, I love the feeling you bring to me, oh, you turn me on
It's exactly what I've been yearning for, give it to me strong 
And meet me in my boudoir, make my body say ah ah ah 
I like it-like it 
Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it 
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones 
But chains and whips excite me
Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it

47,Backpacking Around Europe,Yuna,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/yuna/backpacking-around-europe-chords-945259,"We question what we are
This has been the best so far
And I miss you
When we are apart
I barely even know you
You rarely do this too
I don't usually talk to strangers
Until I met you
And this feeling shall last
This feeling shall last
We are proud enough to not to know
That we aren't strong enough to let it go
And this feeling shall last
This feeling shall last
We could be a thousand years apart
And you'll always have my heart
Well this has been nice
We’ll meet again sometime
But I cant promise you
Cause I'm flying away
When I'm on top of some building
In Montreal
With the lovely view
I'll think of you
And this feeling shall last
This feeling shall last
We are proud enough to not to know
That we aren't strong enough to let it go
And this feeling shall last
This feeling shall last
We could be a thousand years apart
And you'll always have my heart
We’re going that backpacking trip
Travelling Europe
And the 7 different languages
Learn to say Hello
Oh will you go on top of the Eiffel Tower
We’ll drive around Rome
Before we head on home
Its a small world darling
And we are still young
We might be so far away
We might just meet again someday
And this feeling shall last
This feeling shall last
We are proud enough to not to know
That we aren't strong enough to let it go
And this feeling shall last
This feeling shall last
We could be a thousand years apart
And you'll always have my heart

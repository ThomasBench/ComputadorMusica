0,Var Ar Du Min Van,Lisa Nilsson,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lisa-nilsson/var-ar-du-min-van-chords-1409994,"Nu är sommar'n här och fjärden ligger blå.
Hela sta'n är tom och dammig, jag har ingenstans att gå.
Det är tomflaskor i parken, ingenting i tidningen.
Nu är sommar'n här men var är du min vän?
Nu är hösten här och luften är som glas.
Och jag räknar varje timme för du kommer väl tillbaks?
Mörkret rasar över husen och imorgon blir det regn.
Nu är hösten här men var är du min vän?
Nu är vintern här och natten är så hård.
Jag vill tänka på nå't annat men att glömma det är svårt.
Jag kan inte längre se, det blåser snö i ögonen.
Nu är vintern här men var är du min vän?
Nu är våren här och vinden ligger på.
Trottoarerna är smutsiga och gatorna är grå.
och förlåt om jag är dyster, det ska nog bli bättre se'n.
Nu är våren här men var är du min vän?
Nu är livet här, jag borde hoppa på.
Jag har inget att förlora, men jag stannar här ändå.
Jag har vant mig vid att vänta, jag kan vänta länge än.
Nu är livet här men var är du min vän?
Nu är livet här men var är du min vän?

43,Weź Nie Pytaj,Paweł Domagała,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/2542176," Ciągle chodzę, w te same miejsca, Bo gdzie indziej miałbym być?
 Ja nie szukam, ja wszystko mam! Teraz trzymam to w rękach, bo nie chcę wypuścić już nic.
 Nie chcę przygód, ja Ciebie mam, Ciebie mam! Największą przygodę jaką zesłał mi Pan 
 Ja się nie nudzę, ja się Tobą nie nudzę! Codziennie od nowa Cię kocham, no kocham więc chodź, weź 
Weź nie pytaj, weź się przytul, weź tu ze mną, weź tu bądź.
Weź nie młodniej, weź się starzej, razem ze mną idź krok w krok
Weź nie pytaj, weź się przytul, weź tu ze mną, weź tu bądź.
Weź nie młodniej, weź się starzej, razem ze mną idź krok w krok
Nie chcę wolności, chcę miłości, miłości. Wolności ja nie chcę, miłości tak dużo mi daj, weź no 
 Nie chcę w spokoju, chcę we dwoje, Chcę się wściekać o bzdury ja wszystko to wszystko chcę mieć!
 Nie chcę żyć polityką, kiedy tłumy na mieście Ja córkom zrobię jeść.
 Nic nie muszę, ja wszystko mam, wszystko mam. I Ciebie i małe i więcej nie muszę już nic!
Weź nie pytaj, weź się przytul, weź tu ze mną, weź tu bądź.
Weź nie młodniej, weź się starzej, razem ze mną idź krok w krok
Weź nie pytaj, weź się przytul, weź tu ze mną, weź tu bądź.
Weź nie młodniej, weź się starzej, razem ze mną idź krok w krok
 Kiedy stuknie mi pięćdziesiąt lat, Wkoło fury i bzdury,
 Dziewczyny młode do mnie: „Ech” i „Ach”! Ty wołaj mnie, zawołaj mnie, zawołaj mnie
Weź nie świruj, weź się przytul, weź tu przy mnie, weź tu trwaj.
Weź nie młodniej, weź się starzej, razem ze mną zawsze bądź!
Weź nie pytaj, weź się przytul, weź tu ze mną, weź tu bądź.
Weź nie młodniej, weź się starzej, razem ze mną, razem ze mną, No weź!

Oh oh oh
You act like you need remindin'
Tryna do it over, bring it back and rewind it
But all that glitters isn't gold, I was blinded
Should have never gave you my heart on consignment
And I can't believe the lies that I went for
Thought you was mine, but you decided to be with him though
You took my feelings and just threw 'em out the window
Feel like it's too hard to fall in love again, no
On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya
Can you tell me what's with all this distant love?
If I called, would you pick it up?
On some nights like this, I just wanna text you, but for what?
You gon' say you want me, then go switch it up
Just gon' play with my emotions just because, no (Oh)
All them times I played the fool for you
Thinkin' we could put it back together, thought we had forever
You never see my point of view
Our connection is so severed, you don't show no effort
And I can't believe the lies that I went for
Thought you was mine, but you decided to be with him though
You took my feelings and just threw 'em out the window

I've been way too good to you, you take me for granted
You was my day one since back at Big B's house on Adams
First day that we met, I flagged you down, I told you, ""Hit my line""
Used to promise me you'd never switch on me like Gemini
You think I'm a fool, ain't nobody stupid
I see all the signs, I see all the clues
Yeah, sometimes I reminisce 'bout that shit when I'm bingin'
Can't believe it's been a whole year, yeah, but...

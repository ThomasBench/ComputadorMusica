0,I Wish,R. Kelly,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/r-kelly/i-wish-chords-1815000,"I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish
Rollin' through the hood, just stopped by to say what's up
And let you know that your baby boy ain't doing so tough
And even though you passed going on four long years
Still waking up late at night crying tears
Just thinking about those days you used to talk to me
Smilin' while I'm sippin' on this Hennessy
And remember we bragged on how rich we would be, to get up out this hood was like a fantasy
And now you hear my songs the radio is playin'
Oh I can't believe my ears
And what everybody's sayin'
And boy I'll tell you, folks don't know the half
I would give it all up, just to take one ride
How I used to kick it on the front porch
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now I'm just missing you
I wish that I could hold you now
I wish that I could touch you now
I wish that I could talk to you
Be with you somehow
I know you're in a better place
Even though I can't see your face
I know you're smiling down on me
Saying everything's okayyy
And if I make it out this thug life
I'll see you again someday
I wish, I wish, I wish
I wish, I wish, I wish
Now ever since this money come, been nothing but stress
Sometimes I wish I could trade in my success
Y'all look at me and say boy you've been blessed
But y'all don't see the inside of my unhappiness
Man I swear this shit gets heavy like a ton
That's why you hear me shootin' This real shit off like a gun
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits And fake ass playas get a real playa hatin' 'em
Honey Love goes platinum and y'all ass come around
But y'all don't wanna raise the roof until my shit is going down
How I used to hoop off in them tournaments
And how I used to club hop on weekends
Your family called the morning of the tragic end
Damn, my condolensces
Voices in my head be telling me to come to church
Saying the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hurst
When waking up to life sometimes seems worst
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies now
For me to save the world I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion men?
How I used to street perform on Friday
And how I used to go to church on Easter Sunday
Standing here throwing them stones at me
Somebody pray for me

For you to feel alone
You don't let him walk all over your heart

And I ain't making it easy

But I know he be tired he don't mean it
It gets hard sometimes
But I need my man

Now that I’m recovering
I’m so glad for one thing only
I’m so, so glad I let you in

Your love’s that powerful

It's been pouring names, now I'm all drenched up in shame

Oh baby, you see I'm a strong man
And I have seen some dark sides of life in my days, baby
But nothing, somehow nothing compares to this, no no baby
I ain't never been on my two knees before
And I ain't never been the kind to say please before
I'm out of options baby, and tricks to make you stay
This is not a threat, but if you walk out that door, it'll be like
    Dragging my heart out on the concrete
It'll be like wasting my parts out in the dark streets
It'll be like murder, it will be murder
This is not a threat, but if you walk out that door, it'll be like
    Leaving behind a helpless dying man
It'll be like simply killing me, don't you understand?
It'll be like murder, this will be murder
I've said I'm sorry, but I guess that didn't work
So I tried to love you, but I guess that made it worse
Because now you're looking at me ever so calmly
And it's that look on your face that frightens me
'Cause that look means you've made up your mind
And that look means my crying is a waste of time
I'm out of options baby, out of tricks to make you stay
This is not a threat, but if you walk out that door, it'll be like
    Dragging my heart out on the concrete
It'll be like wasting my parts out in the dark streets
It'll be like murder, it will be murder
This is not a threat, but if you walk out that door, it'll be like
    Leaving behind a helpless dying man
It'll be like simply killing me, don't you understand?
It'll be like murder, this will be murder
    You see, I need you to stay, out of pity, love or a lack of choice
      We can face reality tomorrow, but for now, just for now
Let's just run away
This is not a threat, but if you walk out that door, it'll be like
    Dragging my heart out on the concrete
It'll be like wasting my parts out in the dark streets
It'll be like murder, it will be murder
This is not a threat, but if you walk out that door, it'll be like
    Leaving behind a helpless dying man
It'll be like simply killing me, don't you understand?
It'll be like murder, this will be murder

I was born black and free,     I was born in the cold
You see cold was home to me,      until I was told
I was really from the South,       so I travelled closer to the sun
But you see, flesh burning heat got me crossing the sea
Back to the cold again
So here I am,      here I am
    I'm        a stranger, anywhere I run to
Yes I am a stranger
The roots to my name, but who I am                          Add2 = 507600
Now there's this fuss about colour
     And everybody needs to belong                         B11#9 = 767700
  So take a minute to consider my perspective
You see, black kicked me out once and white took me in
But white looked at me once and nearly spat at my skin
   I'm so confused, I'm so confused about who I should hate
I figure I'll just love them all

thought I'd be the only one that'd really know how 
But u showed me different and I know better now, 
I gotta get u out my system somehow

U were my girl, now we 'aint even friends, 
u couldve been my all or nothing, all or nothing, 
now to me ur nothing, girl u r nothing, now ur nothing 
Put u on a pedestal, girl I held u so high 
was never too good at finding the words to describe, 
just how I felt for u but u know that I tried, 
but somehow we went and changed inside 
U damn near were my everything ur still on my mind, 
but I'd rather be here all alone and I'm doin just fine 
gotta take it back to the days before we met 
and live our lives as strangers again

When u went away - I can't help but wonder 
Was he worth my pain - U shud know 
better - and I shouldve too 
And I cried, and u cried and we tried to make it work, 
almost died while we tried, is that 
If I cud do it again, I would be a better man,

Don't you know, how much I care

'cause I love you on the square
It's not bound by any definition
It isn't written in the stars
It's not limited like Saturn
It isn't ruled by Mercury or Mars
Oh won't you meet me, in the Indian summer
Where we'll go walking down by the weeping willow tree
Won't you meet me, in the Indian summer
We'll go walking to eternity
It's not modeled by convention
It isn't worshiped like the sun
It's not likened unto any other
And it will never come undone
Well don't you know, that my world is so lonely
Just like a freight train in the dawn
That's why I need to, have and hold you
Just to keep me from, going wrong

Where we'll go walking down by the weeping willow tree
Won't you meet me, in the Indian summer
We'll go walking to eternity

Won't you meet me, in the Indian summer

Now I brace myself for the fights
something must go wrong 'cause it's way too right 
I’m light as a feather tonight 
Cause I can’t feel the ground

It's too good to be true 
I don’t deserve you 
I never felt a love strong enough to 
Stop this world from spinning 
Stop this world from spinning 
And I see, 
Heaven when she looks at me 
In her smile is the most amazing dream 
And in her eyes I fall asleep 
And I hope, 
Hope that she can see through the smoke 
Of my imperfections into my soul 
And my heart where she has control  she has control
Cause I can’t feel the ground

45,Two Drink Minimum (ver 2),Chris Cornell,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/chris-cornell/two-drink-minimum-chords-800967,"   As hope and promise fades
and the sun forgets to rise
I'm lonely and I'm thirsty
but it's better I stay dry
Never more than two drinks away
from crying
Stare into the glass
and wait for the time to pass
And thank you for the offer
but you know I must decline
Never more than two drinks away
from crying
There used to be a time
When I could hold my head up high
My life stretched out before me
and rivers flowed with wine
I had my love beside me
and everything was fine
But now the ride is over
It's hard to say goodbye
As hope and promise fades
and midnight turns to day
I'd love to drown my sorrow
but I cannot tell a lie
Never more than two drinks away
from crying

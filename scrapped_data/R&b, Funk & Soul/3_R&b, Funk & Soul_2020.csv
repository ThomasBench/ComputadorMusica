Cuando más falta hacía

Cuando más te quería

Yo me creía que era el más cabrón
Pero me estoy notando el corazón
Estás apretando mucho mami déjalo
Si quieres te doy la razón
Yo lo único que quiero es largarme de aquí
Me da igual dónde, puedes elegir
Algún día dentro de poco me voy a arrepentir
De haberte confesado lo que me haces sufrir
Tú me dejaste de querer
Cuando menos lo esperaba
Cuando más te quería
  Se te fueron las ganas
De punta en blanco para ir a tu fiesta
He pasado tres días con la misma ropa puesta
Loco por ti, perdiendo apuestas
Dime en quién piensas cuando te acuestas
Porque yo pienso en ti, son ilusiones
Yo pienso en ti, son ilusiones
Porque yo pienso en ti, son ilusiones

Said you'd never hurt me, but here we are

How could you be so reckless with my heart?

Movies for two
We’ll take off our phones and
We’ll turn off our shoes
We’ll play Nintendo
Though I always lose
Cause you watch the TV
While I’m watching you
There’s not many people I’d honestly say
I don’t mind losing to
But there’s nothing like doing nothing with you
Dumb conversation
We lose track of time
Have I told you lately
I’m grateful you’re mine
We’ll watch the notebook
For the 17th time
I’ll say it’s stupid
Then you’ll catch me cryin’
We’re not making out on a boat in the rain
Or in a house I painted blue
But there’s nothing like doing nothing with you
So shut all the windows
Lock all the doors
We’re not looking for no one
Don’t need nothing more
You’ll bite my lip and I’ll want you more
Until we end up in a heap on the floor
Hmmm hmmmm hmmmm
You could be dancing on tabletops
Wearing high heels
Drinking until the world spins like a wheel
But tonight your apartment has so much appeal
Who needs stars, we've got a roof
And there’s nothing like doing nothing with you
Hmmmmmmmm
No, there’s nothing like doing nothing with you

Don't leave the house at midnight and expect the birds to sing
If you're looking for a reason, you needn't even try
Sometimes, it's time to let a good thing die
You can't conjure up more money if you've only got a dime
No use praying for your younger days if you're running out of time
You can take a horse to water, but you can't teach fish to fly
Sometimes, it's time to let a good thing die
You can't light a fire from nothing, or clap and make snow fall
You can't summon love up in your heart if it isn't there at all
Life isn't like the movies, but it sure will make you cry
When it dawns on you it's time to say goodbye
You can't drum up the heartbeats of loved ones come to pass
Stop wishing for forever 'cause nothing ever lasts
If it's keeping you from sleeping, wipe the tear from your eye
'Cause sometimes, it's time to let a good thing die

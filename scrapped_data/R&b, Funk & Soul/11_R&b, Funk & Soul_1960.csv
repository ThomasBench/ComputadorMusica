A soul is somethin' that comes from deep inside,
but a soul is a somethin' that you can't hide.
What is soul? What is soul, baby?
Search your heart, go deep down low..way down 
there you'll find your soul.
Come near girl, you look so cold, touch my hand 
and warm your soul.
Baby, baby, what's wrong with you..you don't know 
what I'm going through.
Hold me so tight, so tight I can't breathe.
Can't you feel it girl, don't you know what I mean?
This is soul!

At least that's the way the story goes
Frankie bought everything for Johnny
From his sports car to his Ivy League clothes
Aw, he was a man alright
Oh, but he was doing her wrong
Just to show you what can happen
A friend came running to Frankie
She said you know I wouldn't tell you no lie
I saw your man ridin' in his Jaguar
With a chick named Nellie Blye
Oh, if he was your man honey
Let me tell you he was doing you wrong
Let me tell the story
Frankie ran around the corner
And peeked in a swinging place
And there she saw Johnny with a woman
He had his arms around her waist
Aw...he was a man alright
But Frankie could see that he was
Doing her wrong
And oh let me tell you
Frankie reached down in her pocketbook
And up with a long forty-four
She shot once, twice, three times
And Johnny fell on the hard wood floor
Aw...he was a man alright
But she shot him because he was doing her wrong
But the last thing he told her was
Frankie, you know I love you
Why? Honey, why did you do that?
Frankie, I was telling her about you
Frankie, you know I love you
Frankie, you know that I love you

Now Frankie, you know good and well that I love you

If you need me, call me. No matter where you are, no matter how far
Just call my name.    I'll be there in a hurry
On that you can depend and never worry
I know, I know you must follow the sun, wherever it leads
But remember, if you should fall short of your desires
Remember life holds for you one guarantee,   You'll always have me
And if you should miss my lovin' one of these old days
If you should ever miss the arms that used to hold you so close
or the lips that used to touch yours so tenderly
      Just remember what I told you, the day    I      set   you    free
Ain't no mountain high enough,   Ain't no valley low enough (say it again)
Ain't no river wide enough to keep me from you  2x
Ain't no mountain high enough       Ain't no valley low enough
Nothing can keep me, keep me from you

Laughter in the eyes where tears used to be

0,Nothing Even Matters,Lauryn Hill,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lauryn-hill/nothing-even-matters-chords-1858782,"Now the skies could fall
Not even if my boss should call
The world it seems so very small
'Cause nothin' even matters, at all
See nothin' even matters
See nothin' even matters at all
Nothin' even matters
Nothin' even matters at all
See, I don't need no alcohol
Your love makes me feel ten feet tall
Without it, I'd go through withdrawal
'Cause nothin' even matters at all
Nothin' even matters
Nothin' even matters at all
Nothin' even matters
Nothin' even matters at all
These buildings could drift out to sea
Some natural catastrophe
Still there's no place I'd rather be
'Cause nothin' even matters to me
See nothin' even matters
See nothin' even matters to me
Nothin' even matters
Nothin' even matters to me
You're part of my identity
I sometimes have the tendency
To look at you religiously, baby
'Cause nothin' even matters to me
Nothin' even matters
Nothin' even matters to me
Now you won't find me at no store
I have no time for manicures
With you it's never either or
'Cause nothin' even matters no more
See nothin', it don't matters
See nothin' even matters no more
Nothin' even matters
Nothin' even matters no more
Now my team could score
And make it to the final four
Just repossess my 4 x 4
'Cause nothin' even matters no more
Nothin' even matters
Nothin' even matters no more
To me, to me, to me, to me, to me

As she contemplates the stain across the wall 
And it's in between the cleaning and the washing 
That's when looking back's, the hardest part of all 
And she always did her best to try and please him 
While he always did his best to make her cry 
And she got down on her knees to stop him leaving 
But he always knew one day he'd say goodbye 
  Where are your friends, where are your children 
  Is this your house is this your home 
  Does nothing ever last forever,
  Does everybody sleep alone?
And he tearÂ´s the business tags from his old suitcase 
As he packs away the pieces of his life 
They all love him but they always try to change him 
That's what happens when a girl becomes a wife 
And she pours herself another cup of coffee 
As she contemplates the stain across the wall 
And it's in between the cleaning and the washing 
That's when looking back's, the hardest part of all
  Where are your friends, where are your children 
  Is this your house is this your home 
  Does nothing ever last forever,

After so much suffering, I finally found unvarnished truth
I was all by myself for the longest time, so cold inside
And I heard from my heart it would not subside, I felt like dying
Until you saved my life
Thank God I found you, I was lost without   you
My every wish and every dream, some how became reality
You brought the sunlight, complete in my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'cause baby I'm so thankful I found you
I will give you everything
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To insure your happiness, I'll cherish every part of you
'Cause without you beside me I can't survive, I don't wanna try
If you're keeping me warm each and every night, I'll be alright
'Cause I need you in my life
Thank God I found you, I was lost without   you
My every wish and every dream, some how became reality
You brought the sunlight, complete in my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'cause baby I'm so thankful I found you
See, I was so destitute before you came to me
Looking back, I guess it shows that we were destined to shine
After the rain, to appreciate, be careful what we have
And I'll go through it all, over again to be able to feel this way
Thank God I found you, I was lost without   you
My every wish and every dream, some how became reality
You brought the sunlight, complete in my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
Sweet baby I'm so thankful I found you
Thank God I found you, I was lost without   you

When divided we stand baby, united we fall.
  Got the time, got a chance, gonna make it, got my hands on your heart, gonna
take it.  All I know, I can't fight this way
You could have a change of heart, if you would only change your mind,
'cos I'm crazy 'bout you baby, time after time. (Without you) One night alone,
  is like a year without you baby, do you have a heart of stone?
(Without you) Can't stop the hurt inside, when love and hate collide.
I don't wanna fight no more, I don't know what we're fighting for. When we treat
each other baby, like an act of war. I could tell a million lies, but it
would come as no surprise. When the truth is like a stranger, it hits you
right between the eyes
  There's a time, and a place, and a reason, and I know I got a love to believe in.
  All I know, got to win this time.

Introduce the carpet 2 something other than your knees

No one could be more made up than you
Nothin's left for guessin'
What a shame (Boo hoo) Boo hoo

And I know that it is love
And this place could be much brighter
Than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel
There's no hurt or sorrow
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong it only cares for joyful giving
If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear or dread we stop existing and start living
Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
Make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me

There are people dying
If you care enough for the living

Wound this earth crucify this soul

 She wants to give it, (aah, she wants to give it).
 She wants to give it, (aah, she wants to give it).
 She wants to give it, (aah, she wants to give it).
 Just open the door, and you will see;
 This passion burns, inside of me.
 Don't say to me, you'll never tell;
Touch me there, make the move, cast the spell.
Because, there's something a-bout you, baby,

That's why he never ever has enough
To treat his lady right

And says 'Money don't matter to night'
Money don't matter to night

Just when you think you've got more than enough
That's when it all up and flies away

They're tellin' him he just can't lose
So he goes off and tries to find a partner
But all he finds are users (users)
All he finds are snakes in every color
Every nationality and size
Seems like the only thing that he can do
Is just roll his eyes, and say that
Money don't matter to night (don't matter)

That's when you find out that you're better off

And it sure don't matter to night

And you took up for me
When everyone was downinâ me

Now we are not afraid although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains long before we knew we could   ohhhhh, yes

Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe  oeoeoe yeah
In this time of fear when prayers so often prove in vain
Hope seems like the summer birds so swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here my heart's so full I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words I never thought I'd say

Her acceptance is the way we pay.
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day.
As today I know I'm living but tomorrow
could make me the past but that I musn't fear 'cause you're here.

Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that 8x8x8 is 4
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Did you know that true love asks for nothing?
Her acceptance is the way we pay.
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day.
As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Now I know deep in my mind the love of me I've left behind
And I'll be loving you always.
Until the rainbow burns the stars out of the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away
Until the day that 8x8x8 is 4
Until the day that is the day that are no more
Always         always
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean covers every mountain high
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream
Until the day is night and night becomes the day
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away

    But there's a rumor goin' all around that u ain't been gettin' served.
    They say that u ain't ""U know what"" in, baby, who knows how long,
    it's hard 4 me 2 say what's right when all I wanna do is wrong.
Gett off â 23 positions in a one night stand,
gett off â I'll only call u after if u say I can.
Gett off â let a woman be a woman and a man be a man,
gett off â if u want 2, baby, here I am.
2.   I clocked the jizz from a friend of yours, named Vanessa Bet,
    she said u told her a fantasy that got her all wet.
    Something about a little box with a mirror and a tongue inside,
    what she told me then, got me so hot, I knew that we could slide.
3. Naw, little cutie, I ain't drinkin',        but scope this, I was just thinkin'
    u + me,       what a ride,       if u was thinkin' the same, we could
    continue outside, lay your pretty body against a parkin' meter,
    strip your dress down like I was strippin' a Peter Paul's    Almond Joy.
    Lemme show u, baby, I'm a talented boy !
    Everybody grab a body, pump it like u want somebody !
    Get off,                so here we,         so here we, so here we are,
    here we are in my paisley crib, what cha want 2 eat? (Ribs!)
    Naw toy, I don't serve ribs, u better be happy that dress is still on,
    I heard the rip when u sat down.
    Honey, them hips is gone, but that's alright, I clock 'em that way,
    remind me of somethin' James used 2 say.
    ""I like 'em fat,         I like 'em proud, u got 2 have a mother 4 me.""
    Baby,       2night u're a star,         I'm the Big Dipper.
+ Kick it.                     Get off.

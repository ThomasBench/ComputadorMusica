I'll sign the dotted line;
You know, I'm gonna shine
She just needs that big break, that great take
To start my new career;
You'll see that I'm sincere
And I won't blow it
Uh, Mister Director? Please...
Don't reject her til you're heard her read
For the lead in your new production
Mister Producer? Please...
Don't seduce her til you're heard her sing
And everything in your new production
She got to be hot stuff, real tough
I wanna be photographed
Asked for my autograph
I don't want to keep house for a spouse
I'm much rather be the girl;
I need much more to be the pearl
Of the movies
I'm much rather be the girl;
I need much more to be the pearl
Of the movies
I'm much rather be the girl
Need much more to be the pearl

So you through what you gotta do

Just chase that dappled dream of yours

They make you feel so bad
They say you don't treat me like you should

I've had my eyes wide open from the start

That it would only add to the pain

But I never thought, that we would lose our way

I tried to persuade her to wait

No matter how hard we tried
And it seems that there's no way to get around it

Tonight I saw her, I didn't know what to say
I just tried to smile, but had to walk away
I turned to tell her 'I love you'

Ain't nothing like the real  thing,  ba -by.      Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real  thing,  ba -by.      Ain't nothing like the real thing 
I play my games of fan-ta-sy.    I pretend but I know in real..ity.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me 
No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much - to make me feel better 
So let's stay together.... 
I got some memories to look back on..  though they help me when you're gone 
I'm well aware nothing can   take the place of you being there. 
Oh So glad we  got the real  thing,   ba-by.     So glad we  got the real thing 
Ain't nothing like the real  thing,  ba -by.      Ain't nothing like the real thing
Oh So glad we  got the real  thing,   ba-by.     So glad we  got the real thing

Forced me to take his life

As his bare feet hit the floor
Grabs a cup of coffee
Straps his Magnum on once more
Feeds the cat he lives with
Since his wife walked out the door
In nine years, he'll retire with a pension
Everyday, he suffers
Because he sees all kinds of pain
Sometimes feels helpless
In a world that's gone insane
Then he wins a battle
It re stores his faith a gain
It's only human kindness he is after

The Lord and I have been friends for a mighty long time
Belle...
Leaving him has never ever really crossed my mind
I'd never go so far
cause it's Him no matter who you are
Belle...
oh it's you that I want, but it's Him that I need
Belle...
the laughter of the sound has quieted down
Belle...
The best thing we could do is have Him around
I think if love could've found
my heart was lost but now it's found
Belle...
Let's you and I let the love come down
It seems so easy to me
I've tried to act naturally
Let's not waste each other's time
Belle...
Lord, He's my surprisin', my pride and my joy,
Belle...
I know that you can understand
This little country boy
He brought me safe thus far...
through many drunken country bars
Belle…
He's my bright morning star
In the morning (time)
In the evening (time)
In the daytime
In the nighttime...

  Saw me a girl today     
   Who walked with such a gentle sway
    And I knew right from the start  
   She was the one who could cop my heart
       I know someday
That we could happen
In a special way
I wish I may       I wish I might
      Make you my all-star shining bright
And I know, I can feel it    This time it's real
   Other girls that I had were fine
    But they were mainly just to pass the time
   Though I must confess I had some fun
Now I know that you're the only one
     All I can say girl is that I 
love you each and everyday
And if I may         If I might
    I'll make you the all-star of my life
And I know, I can feel it, hey  This time it's real
And I know, I can feel it, hey  This time it's real
  Now's the time for me to make my move
  Girl we gotsa get in the groove
  It's what we do with the what we got
  Gonna put us up in the slot
   And I hope and pray
We'll get together with no delay
It might be day     It might be night
        It don't matter anytime is right
And I know, I can feel it, hey  This time it's real
And I know, I can feel it, hey  This time it's real
And I know, I can feel it, hey  This time it's real
And I know, I can feel it, hey  This time it's real

  It reflects what I feel
If I say I love you, I mean it
'Cause in my song
Every line is for real
Every man or woman
 Enjoys going home
To a peaceful situation
To give love and receive love
Without any complications
Whether my tune is short or long
Whether my lyrics are weak or strong
I like to live the love
That I sing about in my song
I like to live the love
That I sing about in my song
Music is love
And my love is music
   In perfect harmony
So when I sing
I have song all about
The love of you and me
I never got angry with my guitar
It gives me what I wanna hear
 So I'm finding out that
We are quite like my song together, my dear
Outside answers
Should always be forbidden
Problems should be solved
And never hidden
I like to live the love
That I sing about in my song
I like to live the love
That I sing about in my song

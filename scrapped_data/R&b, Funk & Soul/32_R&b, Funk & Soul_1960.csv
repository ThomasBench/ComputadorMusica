while stars beam above
Walk with me quietly, oh baby,
then whisper your love
Cause that's what I'm gonna tell you,    how much I love you
With not only my lips, oh no no no no no no no ... oh no, baby
But with all of my heart.
Kiss my lips gently,
oh passion is good
Lay my heart slowly,
awaken to you
Cause that's what I'm gonna tell you,    how much I love you
With not only my lips, oh no, my darling, oh no, baby oh no no no
But with all of my heart.
Stay always beside me,
through each passing year
Let your precious love,
softly guide us my dear
By then, you'll show 'em all,
yes by then, you'll show 'em all
That I love you so, I do love, I do love you
And with all of my heart,
you got to believe, you got to believe me, you got to believe me
When I say that love you, oh baby, oh my darling, my darling, my darling...

Oh brother Jack you goin' with sister Sadie
When you ought to be at home with your old lady
But your heart is divided in so many pieces
Tryin' to please them both
Never pleasing neither
Oh Jack, take it on back
Before your good thing is gone
Because the downfall of too many men
Is the upkeep of too many women, so
Take care of your homework, fella
If you don't somebody will, oh yeah
You better take care of your homework, fella
If you don't somebody will,  Now wait a minute here!
Oh brother Fred how he used to run
Staying out all night leaving his homework undone
Now Fred's old lady took as much as she could stand
Then one night the next-door neighbor
Gave her a helping hand
Oh fellas, take it on home
Before your good thing is gone
Because the downfall of too many men
Is the upkeep of too many women, so
Take care of your homework fella
If you don't somebody will, oh you’d better hear me now, I’m back
You better take care of your homework, fella
If you don't somebody will,  Listen to me, y’all!
Bring it on home
Get off the streets, y’all
Take it on home
Ahhhhhhhh, all right
Oh fellas let me tell you
These girls are gettin’ hip
You can only slide so long
Before you make a slip
Take care of your homework, fella
If you don't somebody will
You better take care of your homework, fella
If you don't somebody will
Take it, take it on home
Get off the streets

Strung on a   chain and wagged his cute little tail
Whenever you call his name
But baby that will be no more re-member when you walked out that door
I was on my knees i said ""now baby please"" you just looked at me and
Said ""no score"" and you said its no joke and maybe one day you'll be
Back   again
Well, baby i got lucky again
I made myself a million tears
And another thing I want to say
I found myself another friend

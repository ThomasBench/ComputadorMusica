Waiting on the planet to turn to me, dark side
If loving you's a felony now, then I'm a renegade, riding
Trying to find tomorrow and ease in
'Til you dive in
Why you rolling waves over me now, that's all I need, dreaming
Waiting on a lady, come find me, be forgiven
I'll be a regular guy for you, I never said I'd do that
Why you looking so beautiful to me now when you're so sad?
I will always think about you
That's why I'm calling you back
On my way through
I wanna stay with you for a long time, I wanna be your stone, love
I wanna see it lay in your eyes when I'm leaving with your love
I will always think about you
That's why I'm calling you back
'Cause I gotta run soon
I will always think about you
That's why I'm calling you back

Am I supposed to hold out, darling?
We don't have forever
(I'm just a bug)
I'm just a bug and I'm yours to slowly digest
To her I came just to lay and rest my head
Her firm embrace, it would make my final bed
Mother nature takes no prisoners
But I'll never leave these living walls
You got me seduced in fluent haiku
I'll be abused if that means I can lie beside you
Where I'll dissolve
Into the colours on the forest floor
Where far above
The butterflies flutter by but I won't
Buzz along
To her I came just to lay and rest my head
Her firm embrace, it would take my final breath
But mother nature decides
She'll always rule and you'll abide it
Just lie to die
I'm in love

Kelly had a fat ass and trouble was cookin'
She had a boy wrapped around her finger tight
I fell in love with him, but he wasn't in my life

She was kissin' Brendon, I got jelly

I just waited 'til recess to make her pay

Should I give him away or feel this bad?

When you come and hurt us just so you can get your money
Forced to follow the leader who's being possessed by demons

Killing kids all day and night, prescription pills and online fights
Shooting at the angels while claiming you're the good guy

Stand back watch it taking shape
Wondering why I don't look like Barbie
They say boys like girls with a tiny waist
Now my momma's preaching to make sure I'm pure
But I never really cared about that shit before
Look around the room to whoever wants me
The boys actin' like they ain't seen skin before
Got sent home to change 'cause my skirt is too short
It's my fault, it's my fault
'Cause I put icing on top
Now, the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake
That's my bad, that's my bad
No one taught them not to grab
Now, the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake
Gotta make sure that my legs are shiny
Hot wax melting, burn my skin
People all around me watching closely
'Cause it's how I look and not what I think
Mikey's eyes seem to be glued to her chest
So I'm stuffing my bra so that mine look the best
It's my fault, it's my fault
'Cause I put icing on top
Now, the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake
That's my bad, that's my bad
No one taught them not to grab
Now, the boys want a taste of the strawberry shortcake
Instead of making me feel bad for the body I go - o-o-o- ot
Just teach him to keep it in his pants and tell him to stop
It's my fault, it's my fault

We can be friends if you want to be
But only 'til the clock hits three

Talk about the boys that we want to smash
Talk about ways to get a little more cash

Want a baby in the back with the man of their dreams

Wanna be my best friend, then judge me

Pouty, pretty cute, and she bit her lip back to him
Chewing on her nails and her pens while she's dreaming of him
And he's fucking in sin (You know he is)

Well, do you? Tell me that

I knew this wouldn't last, but fuck you, don't you leave me here

If I'm so special, why am I secret?

Except how to lie and cheat while inside the sheets
Stop calling me your bunny

Do you? I bet you think you do

Can we just be honest?
These are the requirements
If you think you can be my one and only true love
You must promise to love me
And damn it, if you fuck me over
I will rip your fucking face apart
Step one
You must accept that I'm a little out my mind
Step two
This is a waste if you can't walk me down the finish line
Step three
Give me passion, don't make fun of my fashion
Step four
Give me more, give me more, more
If you can't handle a heart like mine
Don't waste your time with me
If you're not down to bleed, no, oh
If you can't handle the choking, the biting
The loving, the smothering
'Til you can't handle it no more, no more
Can we just be honest?
These are the requirements
If you think you can be my one and only true love
You must promise to love me
And damn it, if you fuck me over
I will rip your fucking face apart

  They're trying to waste my time
High school sweethearts, shut up
If you're not my type
High school sweethearts, line up
  They're trying to waste my time
High school sweethearts, shut up
Step five
You can't be scared to show me off and hold my hand
Step six
Step seven, this one goes to eleven
    If you cheat, you will die, die
If you can't handle a heart like mine
   Don't waste your time with me
   If you're not down to bleed, no, oh
If you can't handle the choking, the biting
The loving, the smothering
'Til you can't handle it no more, no more
Can we just be honest?

If you're not my type
Could you hold me through the night?
Put your lips all over my mine
Salty face when I start cryin'
Could you be my first time?
Eat me up like apple pie
Make me not wanna die
Love me rough and let me fly
Get me up, yeah, get me high
Tie me down, don't leave my side
Don't be a waste of my time
Can we just be honest?
These are the requirements

I was too young to see the truth
In my grandma's lap, I'm drowning in her perfume
Too naive to even care
'Bout the words she whispered while she brushed out my hair
People gonna say
If you need a break, someone'll take your place
People gonna try
To tell you that you're fine with dollars in their eyes (Just remember)
Don't let them fuck you, honey, no, oh
Don't let them try (Ooh)
Don't let them hurt you, baby
Just say, ""Recess, I'm tired""
Sittin' in my room, looking at all I've done
Everything I wanted has come to fruition
I should be happy but I can't get out my bed
Stressin' 'bout the voices screamin' inside my head
People gonna say
If you need a break, someone'll take your place
People gonna try
To tell you that you're fine with dollars in their eyes (Just remember)
Don't let them fuck you, honey, no, oh
Don't let them try (Ooh)
Don't let them hurt you, baby
Just say ""recess, I'm tired""
Where is my time?
Gone in my mind
Gone, I can't find
Euphoria
When I get upset
I think in my head
back to what she said
People gonna say
If you need a break, someone'll take your place
People gonna try
To tell you that you're fine with dollars in their eyes (Just remember)
Don't let them fuck you, honey, no, oh
Don't let them try (Ooh)
Don't let them hurt you, baby
Just say ""recess,"" I'm tired

give me a memory I can use
take me by the hand
while we do what lovers do
it matters how this ends
'Cause what If I never love again?
I don't need
Your honesty
it's already in your eyes
and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
and since you're the only one that matters
tell me, who do I run to?
Now, don't get me wrong, I know
There is no tomorrow
All I ask is 
If this is my last night with you
hold me like I'm more than just a friend
give me a memory I can use
take me by the hand
while we do what lovers do
it matters how this ends
'Cause what If I never love again?
Let this be our lesson in love
let this be the memory we remember us
I don't want to be cruel or  vicious 
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is 
If this is my last night with you
hold me like I'm more than just a friend
give me a memory I can use
take me by the hand
while we do what lovers do
it matters how this ends
'Cause what If I never lo...ve   again.

Hoping you're someone I used to know

 You sound like a song

 Of when we were young

In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realized
We were scared of getting older, made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
I was so scared to face my fears
'Cause nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
 That's what you said when you left me
You still look like a movie
 You still sound like a song

 Of when we were young

Everything just takes me back to when you were there
To when you were there

 You still sound like a song

Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told ""a tight dress is what makes you a whore""
If ""I love you"" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you...
Anymore
Hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told ""a tight dress is what makes you a whore""
If ""I love you"" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna be you...

47,Death And Taxes,Daniel Caesar,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/daniel-caesar/death-and-taxes-chords-2077479,"Surely my sins have found me out
God rest my soul, but show me out
Surely my sins have found me out
Spit on my grave, but kiss my mouth
Surely we'll live to see the day
When all of our problems, they fade away
I see your heartbreak and I feel your pain
It's funny how heaven and hell are the same
Come walk with me, I don't play those games
I live in the real world, I've lost my faith
Surely we'll live to see the day
When all of our problems, they fade away
Only two things in this life that are sure, of that I'm sure
Only two things in this life that are sure, of that I'm sure
Only two things in this life that are sure, of that I'm sure
Surely my sins have found me out
Only two things in this life that are sure, of that I’m sure
Death and taxes

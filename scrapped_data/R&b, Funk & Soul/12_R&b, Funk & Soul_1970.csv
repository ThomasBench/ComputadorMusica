0,Blame It On The Sun,Stevie Wonder,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/stevie-wonder/blame-it-on-the-sun-chords-213214," Where has my love gone?  How can I go on?
 It seems dear love has gone away.
 Where is my spirit?  I'm nowhere near it.
 Oh yes, my love has gone astray.
But I'll blame it on the sun, the sun that didn't shine.
I'll blame it on the wind    and the trees.
I'll blame it on the time, that never was enough.
I'll blame it on the tide and the sea.
But, my heart blames it on me.
 Who poured the love out?  What made this bitter doubt?
 Is peace not here for me to see?
 Wish I could tell you, how I am feeling.
 But, words won't come for me to speak.
But I'll blame it on the sun, that didn't fill the sky.
I'll blame it on the birds and the trees.
I'll blame it on the day, that ended once too soon, 
I'll blame it on the nights that could not be.
But, my heart blames it on me. (Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh).
(Your heart blames it on you this time).

Then rolls out to sea
And the sea is very still once more

Will your arms open wide
At last we're face to face
And as we kiss through an embrace
I can tell, I can feel
You are love, your are real really
Mine in the rain
In the dark, in the sun

I'm at peace in the web of your arms

Feed me beans every night
Twelve babies look up at me
With big grey hungry eyes

Let love be in the Hearts of all

You and I may never see them cry
Or wonder why the world's so cold
You feel that they're too young
To take a look around
But in their faces I can see the trouble all around
Today we must Turn into lies
The truth already In their minds

There's sunshine in their eyes

'Cause she feels the world is ending
She believes that everything is coming to an end
Papa being real careful
Cause his brother Sam was robbed
trying to buy just a loaf of bread for baby John
See how the world scared
All the streets turning bad
Most of the news is bad
Crime just breeds in the air
Sad is the song rolling along
Everything is happenin'
When is the tune now we are doomed
Everything is happenin'
Cost of livin's up
But the pay is low down
Hate to see the baby starve
'Cause mama can't be found
Sister lives alone
Bolts and chains her door at night
Never ever walks an alley or a shorter way
See how the world scared
All the streets turning bad
Most of the news is bad
Crime just breeds in the air
Sad is the song rolling along
Everything is happenin'
When is the tune now we are doomed
Everything is happenin'
Brother Bill gone fighting
In a place where he is a stranger
But could men die a stranger in every war
We all hide in shame
Boldly pour into another
When the blame we know for sure is right in ourselves In ourselves
Sad is the song rolling along
Everything is happenin'
When is the tune now we are doomed
Everything is happenin'

5,When Did You Stop Loving Me When Did I Stop Loving You,Marvin Gaye,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/marvin-gaye/when-did-you-stop-loving-me-when-did-i-stop-loving-you-chords-4046578,"You know, when you say your marriage vows, they're supposed to be for real
I mean, if you think back about what you really said about honor, loving and obeying till death do us part
and all But it shouldn't be that way, it should, it should, it should be lies because it turns out
to be lies If you don't honor what you said, you lie to God. The words should be changed
Ooh now as I recall, we tried a million times
Again, again and again,
and that isn't all I gave my love to you
each time to make amends
Suddenly I start to realize I can't make it
Pretty birds fly away, I had to leave you for my health's sake
What to do? Make you pay, for leaving you, my fine, is to pay forever
So if a fresh new love comes in, I won't say those words again
Instead I'll say I'll try to love and protect you
With all my heart as long as you want me to baby
Ooh Ohh if I love again I'm gonna try a new way this time
Memories of the things we did; some we're proud of, some we hid
So when two people have to part, sometimes it makes them stronger
Do you remember all of the bullshit, baby? Yaaaa
Ya You say you love me with all your heart
If you ever loved me with all of your heart
You'd never take a million dollars to part
I really tried,    you know I tried, oh baby
Although we tried,       all of those promises was nothin' but lies
I really tried, you know how hard I tried, really tried
We really lied, didn't we baby?
And on top of that you have scandalized, my name
What I can't understand is if you love me
How could you turn me in to the police
Didn't I love you good and try to take care of you?
Best I could,    you were so divine and your love was like mellow wine
Pains of love, miles of tears, enough to last me for my lifetime
Broken hearts last for years, so break away to the new-day sunshine
One thing I can promise, friend; I'll never be back again
But I'm not really bitter, babe
I wish you all the luck and all the love in the world
Good luck in the world
But I know you'll never be satisfied
No, you still want me standin' by your side
Memories haunt you all the time
I will never leave your mind
Got judgment on your side;
You've said bad things and you've lied
Still I remember some of the good things, baby
Like love after dark and picnics in parks
Those are the days I'll not forget in my life
I'd rather remember, remember the joy we shared baby
I'd rather remember all the fun we had
All I ever really wanted was
To love you and treat you right
All we did was fuss and fight
It don't matter baby
Take a lesson from it all (come on)
I never thought I'd see the day when
You'd put me through what you put me through
You tried your best
You say I gave you no rest
When did you stop loving me?
When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me?
When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me?
When did I stop loving you?

 The mission down in Old San Rafael;
 A madman looking for a fight, a madman looking for a fight.
 The massage parlour's open; the clientele come and they go.
 The classic music station;
 Plays in the background soft and low,
 Plays in the background soft and low.
 The silence 'round the cascades; the ice crisp and clear.
 The be-ginning of the opera;
 Seem to suddenly ap-pear, seem to suddenly ap-pear.
 The pancake house is always crowded; open 24 hours of every day.
 And if you suffer from in-somnia;
 You can speed your time a-way, you can speed your time a-way.
 Snow in San An-selmo,
 My waitress, my waitress, my waitress said it was coming down.
 Said it hadn't happened in over 30 years;
 But it was laying on the ground, it was laying on the ground.
 Look at the ivy on the cold clinging wall,
 Look at the flowers and the green grass so tall.
 It's not a matter of when push comes to shove,
 It's just an hour on the wings of a dove.
It's just warm love,
It's just warm love.
 I dig it when you're fancy dressed up in lace,
 I dig it when you have a smile on your face.
 This inspiration's got to be on the flow,
 This invitation's got to see it and know;
It's just warm love,
It's just warm love.
 And it's ever present everywhere,
And it's ever present everywhere; that warm love.
 And it's ever present everywhere,
And it's ever present everywhere; that warm love.
 To the coun-try,   I'm going;
 Lay and laugh in the sun.
 You can bring your gui-tar a-long,
We'll sing some songs, we'll have some fun.
 The sky is crying and it's time to go home,
Inside it's warm love,
Inside it's warm love.
 And it's ever present everywhere,
And it's ever present everywhere; that warm love.
 And it's ever present everywhere, and it's ever present everywhere;
That warm love, that warm love, that warm love.
 Hey kids, dig the first takes,
 Ain't that some interpre-tation?
 When Sinatra sings, against Nelson Riddle strings,
 Then takes a va-cation.
Seen some hard times, drawn some bad lines.
No time for shoe-shines... hard nose the highway.
 I was tore down, at the dead's place,
 Shaved head at the organ.
 But that wasn't half as bad as it was, oh no,
    Belfast and Boston.
Seen some hard times, drawn some bad lines.
No time for shoe-shines... hard nose the highway.
 Put your money where your mouth is,
 Then we can get something going.
 In order to win, you must be prepared to lose some-time,
And leave one or two cards showing.
Seen some hard times, drawn some bad lines.
No time for shoe-shines... hard nose the highway.

 Wants you to pat him on the back.

And they thought it was rather quaint.
But you know it's no use re-peating,
And you know it's no use to think about it.
'Cos when you stop to think a-bout it; you don't need it.
Have you ever heard a-bout the great Hollywood motion picture actor,
 Who knew more than they did?
And the newspapers didn't cover the story;
 Just decided to keep it hid.
Somebody started saying it was an inside job;
 Whatever happened to him?
 Last time they saw him, down on the bow'ry;
With his lip hanging off an old rusty bottle of gin.
Have you ever heard a-bout the so-called Hippies?
 Down on the far side of the tracks.

 Well, the plastic revolutionaries take the money and run.
 Have you ever been down to Love City?
 Where they rip you off with a smile, and it don't take a gun.
 Don't it hurt so bad in Love city?
 Don't it make you not want to bother at all?
And don't they look so self righteous,
When they pin you up a-gainst the wall?
Did you ever, ever see the people,
With the tear drops in their eyes?
I just can't stand it, stand it no how,
Living in this world of lies.
Did you ever hear a-bout the Rock and Roll singers?
 Got three or four Cadil-lacs.
Saying power to the people, dance to the music;
 Wants you to pat him on the back.
Have you ever heard a-bout the great Rembrandt?
Have you ever heard a-bout how he could paint?
And he didn't have e-nough money for his brushes;
And they thought it was rather quaint.
But you know it's no use re-peating,
And you know it's no use to think about it.
'Cos when you stop to think a-bout it; you don't need it.
Have you ever heard a-bout the great,
 Hollywood motion picture actor,
 Who knew more than they did?
And the newspapers didn't cover the story;
 Just decided to keep it hid.
Somebody started saying it was an inside job;
 Whatever happened to him?
 Last time they saw him, down on the bow'ry;
With his lip hanging off an old rusty bottle of gin.
Have you ever heard a-bout the so-called Hippies?
 Down on the far side of the tracks.
They take the eyeballs straight out of your head,
Say son, kid, do you want your eyeballs back?
Did you ever, ever see the people,
With the tear drops in their eyes?
I just can't stand it, stand it no how,
Living in this world of lies.

No need to explain
Just an open door for you
To come in from the rain
It's a long road
When you're all alone
And a man like you
Will always choose the long way home
There's no right or wrong
I'm not here to blame
I just want to be the one
Who keeps you from the rain

And it looks like sunny skies
Now that I know you're alright

But it doesn't matter
'Cause I love you anyway

I was down to my last cigarette
And the clock in the window
At a quarter to eleven
I was watching all the people
Passing by me going places
Just the loneliest guy in the town
Looking for a friendly smile
But all that I could see were faces
And then, just like the taste of milk and honey
I found the stranger I've been looking for
Like a wave, my cup of love was overflowing
I knew the stranger in the crowd
And I would be stranger no more
The love that comes on the corner
At a quarter to eleven
I thought you were to good to be true
All my life I had believed
That angels only live in heaven
But now, we share the taste of milk and honey
Each day is sweeter than the day before
My cup runned overflowing
because the stranger in the crowd
And I would be stranger no more
Deep inside, my cup of love was overflowing

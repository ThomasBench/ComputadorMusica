You're always aiming paper airplanes at me when you're around
You build me up like building blocks just so you can bring me down
You can crush my candy cane but you'll never catch me cry
If you dangle that diploma and I deck you, don't be surprised
I know my ABC's, yet you keep teaching me
I say, fuck your degree, alphabet boy
You think you're smarter than me with all your bad poetry
Fuck all your ABC's, alphabet boy
I'm not a little kid now
Watch me get big now
Spell my name on the fridge now
With all your alphabet toys
You won the spelling bee now
But are you smarter than me now?
You're the prince of the playground
Little alphabet boy

Apples aren't always appropriate apologies
Butterscotch and bubblegum drops are bittersweet to me
You call me a child while you keep counting all your coins
But you're not my daddy and I'm not your dolly
And your dictionary's destroyed

I say, fuck your degree, alphabet boy
You think you're smarter than me with all your bad poetry

2,Happy Home,Lukas Graham,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/lukas-graham/happy-home-chords-1837101,"Mama called about the paper turns out they wrote about me
Now my broken heart´s the only thing that's broke about me
So many people should have seen what we got going on
I only wanna put my heart and my life in songs
Writing about the pain I felt with my daddy gone
About the emptiness I felt when I sat alone
About the happiness i feel when I sing it loud 
He should have heard the noise we made with the happy crowd 
Did my grandaddy know he taught me what a poem was
How you can use a sentence or just a simple pause
What will I say when my kids ask me who my daddy was
I thought about it for a while and I'm at a loss
Knowing that I´m gonna live my whole life without him
I found out a lot of things I never knew about him 
All I know is that I´ll never really be alone
Cause we gotta lot of love and a happy home  
Magazines are writing stuff but I don´t ever read them
Some of the folks I used to know would see and start believing
That I would pass them by on streets and never reach to greet them
I still remember folks even though I rarely meet them
Don´t you know I miss the times when we used to hang
Before twenty deep depended on a single man
Before a single heart was broken by a single blow
Before all our careers depended on a single show  
I grew up with a lot of love in a happy home 
Now I got a lot of cash and I'm on a road
I realize privacy´s becoming difficult
It´s all right now but what about when I´m old
I know my good friends now they´ll last 
the same ones that stood by me when my daddy past 
All I know is that we´ll never really be alone  
Cause we got a lot of love and a happy home  
I write a lot of songs will anybody ever read them 
You hear them on the radio but will you really read them 
Why do we have our idols and why do we wanna be them  
After we see them on TV we really wanna meet them  
Don´t you think they miss the time when they used to hang
Before a fan base depended on a single man
Before a single heart was broken by a single show 
Who´s gonna stand who´s gonna fall I really wanna know  
I grew up with a lot of love in a happy home
My daddy use to play me vinyl but now daddy´s gone
I used to practice with my mommy on the piano
I still get nervous every time I know she´s at a show 
Now my family comes first before everyone
I had the perfect dad I wanna be the perfect son
Though I really feel sometimes I am on my own
I know I got a lot of love and a happy home

Baby the money'll make it easier for me
To run and hide out somewhere (So far away)
Hoppin' through poppy fields, dodgin' evil witches
These houses keep droppin' everywhere

Learning to fly learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
And bare my soul
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that
they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I tried to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

But there's a moon above it's shining ' and I think I hear a call
It's just a whisper through the trees, my ears can hardly make it out
But I can hear it in my heart, vibrating strong as if she shouts
Oh Ari-adne, I am coming, I just need to work this maze inside my head
I came here like you asked, I killed the beast, that part of me is dead
Oh Ari-adne, I just need to work this maze inside my head
If only I'd have listened to you when you offered me that thread
Everything is quiet and I'm not exactly sure
If it really was your voice I heard or maybe it's a door
That's closing up some hero's back, on his track to be a man
Can it be that all us heroes have a path but not a plan?
Oh Ari-adne, I'm coming, I just need to work this maze inside my mind
I wish I had that string, it's so damn dark, I think I'm going blind
Oh Ari-adne, I just need to work this maze inside my mind
For the life of me I don't remember what I came      to find
Now tell me princess are you strolling through your sacred grove?
And is the moon still shining? You're the only thing I'm thinking of
The sword you gave me, it was heavy, I just had to lay it down
It's funny how de-fenseless I can feel here when there's nobody a-round
Oh Ari-adne, I'm coming, I just need to work this maze inside my heart
I was blind, I thought you'd bind me, but you offered me a chart
Oh Ari-adne, I just need to work this maze inside my heart
If I'd known that you could guide me, I'd have listened from the start
Somewhere up there midnight strikes, I think I hear the fall
Of little drops of water, magnified a-gainst the barren wall
It's more a feeling than a substance, but there's nobody a-round
And when I'm in here all a-lone, it's just en-ough to let me drown
Oh Ari-adne, I was coming, but I failed you in this labyrinth of my past
Oh Ari-adne, let me sing you, and we'll make each other last

She said I love you bayayayayby
So I said, what you sayin girl it cant be right
How can you be in love with me, we only just met tonight
So she said.. boy I loved you from the start
When I first heard love goes down, something started burning in my heart
I said stop this crazy talk
And leave right now and close the door
She said but I love you boy I love you so
She said I love you baby oh oh oh oh
She said I love you more than words can say
She said I love you bayayayayby (yes you did)
So now I'm up in the courts
Pleading my case in a witness box
Telling the judge and jury
The same thing that I said to the cops
On the day that I got arrested
I'm innocent I protested
She just feels rejected
Had her heart broken by someone she's obsessed with
She likes sound on my music
She makes out a fan of my music
Thats why ""love goes down"" makes her lose it
Cos she cant seperate the man from the music
And I'm saying all this from the stand
While my girl cries tears from the galleries
This got bigger than I ever could have planned
Like that song by the Zutons ""Valerie""
So the jury dont look like their buying it
And shes making me nervous
Arms crossed, screwed faced like I'm trying it
Their eyes fixed on me like I'm murderous
They wanna lock me up
And throw away the key
They wanna send me down
Even though I told them she..
She said I love you boy
She said I love you baby oh oh oh oh (yes you did)
She said I love you more than words can say
She said I love you bayayayayby
So I said why the hell you gotta treat me this way
You don’t know what love is
You wouldn’t do this if you did
Oh no no no noo

Don't be shy wit it, I'll supply wit it

I think I'm fuckin' gone, rollin' on this floor
Messin' up your carpet
I'll get on it after four more
Sessions of the strong on your floor
Shouldn't fuckin' rolled, but I fuckin' pulled
Feelin' like a billion bucks before
I walked through this door
When I walked through your door
Can't believe I made it
But I made it that's for sure
For sure
I need more
She ain't lookin' for that unconditional
What the fuck these bitches on?
They want what I'm sittin' on
They don't want my love
They just want my potential
Fuck it I'll be sippin' on this, baby livin' off bliss
Got me drownin' in your love
Got me drownin' in the mist
Gimme right attention
Or I'll start drownin' from my wrist
   Baby, if you knew
   The feelin' I would give to
You, oh, you
You, oh, you
Cause I got it girl
Oh, I got it girl
With me, with me
You, oh, you
You, oh, you
Oh I got it girl
Oh I got it girl
With me, with me
  I got a brand new girl
  She'll probably O.D. before I show her to momma
  All these girls try to tell me she got no love
  But all these girls never ever got her blow job
  Ringtone on silent
  And if she stops, then I might get violent
  No call is worth stoppin'
  So, momma please stop callin'
  We can play all night
  It just takes one night
  To let me fuckin' prove
  This feelin' I would give to
You, oh, you
You, oh, you
Yeah I got it girl
Oh I got it girl
With me, with me
You, oh, you
You, oh, you

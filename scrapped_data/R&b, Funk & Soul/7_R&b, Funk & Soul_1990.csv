0,Money Dont Matter 2 Night,Prince,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/prince/money-dont-matter-2-night-chords-3152027,"One more card and it's twenty two
Unlucky for him again
He never had respect for money it's true
That's why he never wins
That's why he never ever has enough
To treat his lady right
  He just pushes her away in a huff
And says 'Money don't matter to night'
Money don't matter to night
It sure didn't matter yesterday
Just when you think you've got more than enough
That's when it all up and flies away
That's when you find out that you're better off
Makin' sure your soul's alright
'Cause money didn't matter yesterday,
And it sure don't matter to night
Look, here's a cool investment
They're tellin' him he just can't lose
So he goes off and tries to find a partner
But all he finds are users (users)
All he finds are snakes in every color
Every nationality and size
Seems like the only thing that he can do
Is just roll his eyes, and say that
Money don't matter to night (don't matter)
It sure didn't matter yesterday
Just when you think you've got more than enough
That's when it all up and flies away
That's when you find out that you're better off
Makin' sure your soul's alright (soul's alright)
'Cause money didn't matter yesterday, (don't matter)
And it sure don't matter to night
Hey now, maybe we can find a good reason
To send a child off to war
So what if we're controllin' all the oil,
Is it worth a child dying for? (is it worth it?)
If long life is what we all live for
Then long life will come to pass
Anything is better than the picture of the child
In a cloud of gas
  And you think you got it bad
Money don't matter to night (no, don't matter)
It sure didn't matter yesterday (yesterday)
Just when you think you've got more than enough
That's when it all up and flies away (flies away, flies away)
That's when you find out that you're better off
Makin' sure your soul's alright (make certain that your soul's alright)
'Cause money didn't matter yesterday, (don't matter)
It sure don't matter to night
Money don't matter to night (no, don't matter)
It sure didn't matter yesterday (yesterday,yesterday)
Just when you think you've got more than enough
That's when it all up and flies away (flies away, flies away)
That's when you find out that you're better off
Makin' sure your soul's alright
'Cause money didn't matter yesterday,
And it sure don't matter to night

2,Chissà Se Stai Dormendo,Jovanotti,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/3073466,"Hai 18 anni e quell'aria da signora ti sta anche male
E non ci credere quando ti dicono che sei speciale
I complimenti costano poco e certe volte non valgon di più
Quello che sei, dove vai ciò che vuoi lo sai soltanto tu
E non ti mettere tutto quel trucco che ti sta male
A me mi piaci perché sei dolce quando sei normale
Quando rinunci ai comportamenti da fotomodella
E mi riempi la faccia di baci e mi accarezzi la pelle
Quando mi dici dai spegni la luce che mi vergogno
Quando sei lì che ti trema la voce e a me mi sembra un sogno
Ti vedo scritta su tutti i muri
Ogni canzone mi parla di te
E questa notte questa città
Mi sembra bellissima
Ti vedo scritta su tutti i muri
Ogni canzone mi parla di te
E questa notte questa città
Mi sembra bellissima
Chissà se stai dormendo
Sei maggiorenne oggi eh? E che cosa è cambiato?
Che puoi firmare le giustificazioni quando avrai bigiato
Ma nella scuola quella senza i libri non ti serve a niente
Perché da oggi devi stare attenta a tutta questa gente
Che ti riempie la testa di cose di facce e di miti
Che non potrai veramente sapere a cosa sono serviti
Quindi bambina non credere a niente che non sia amore
Quindi bambina non credere a niente che non sia amore
Ti vedo scritta su tutti i muri
Ogni canzone mi parla di te
E questa notte questa città
Mi sembra bellissima
Ti vedo scritta su tutti i muri
Ogni canzone mi parla di te
E questa notte questa città
Mi sembra bellissima
Chissà se stai dormendo
A cosa stai pensando
Chissà se stai dormendo
Da quando abbiamo fatto l'amore ci penso spesso
A quanto è bello quando il sentimento si sposa col sesso
Eh.. Sarà stato il destino
A volte penso vorrei lo sai essere stato il primo
E poi ci penso e alla fine è lo stesso perché
Perché tanto non l'hai mai fatto come l'hai fatto con me
Ti vedo scritta su tutti i muri
Ogni canzone mi parla di te
E questa notte questa città
Mi sembra bellissima
Ti vedo scritta su tutti i muri
Ogni canzone mi parla di te
E questa notte questa città
Mi sembra bellissima
Chissà se stai dormendo

4,Doin Just Fine,Boyz II Men,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/boyz-ii-men/doin-just-fine-chords-3574196," There was a time, when I thought life was over and out
When you went away from me
My dying heart made it hard to breathe
 Would sit in my room because I didn't want to have to go out
And see you walking by
One look and I'd break right down and cry
 Now you say that you made a big mistake
 Never meant to take your love away
 But you can save your tired apologies
 Cause it may seem hard to believe
But I,   I'm doin' just fine, getting along very well
Without you in my life
 I don't need you in my life
But I,   I'm doin' just fine
Time made me stronger
You're no longer on my mind
 You were my earth, my number one priority
I gave my love to only you
Anything you'd ask of me, I would do
 But somewhere down the road
You felt a change in the weather and told
Me that you had to journey on
A kiss in the wind and your love was gone, all gone
 Now you say you never meant to play your games
 But girl don't you know it's far too late
 Because you let our love just fall apart
 You no longer have my heart
I,    I'm doin' just fine
Getting along very well without you in my life
 I don't need you in my life
But I,   I'm doin' just fine
Time made me stronger
You're no longer on my mind
I don't need you anymore
 When you said goodbye, I felt so all alone
There were times at night I couldn't sleep
My heart was much too weak to make it on my own
Baby after all the misery and pain you put me through
So unfair to me girl, you're no longer my world
And I ain't missin' you at all
I'm        fine, (I'm doin' just fine baby)

Without you in my life
 I don't need you in my life

Getting along very well without you in my life (But I knew you'd be coming 'round someday)
 I don't need you in my life (Just as sure as my name is Wanya)
Said I'm,   I'm doin' just fine

Feeling your heart beat with mind
Softly you whisper, youre so sincere
How could our love be so blind
We sailed on together
We drifted apart
And here you are by my side
So now I come to you, with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me
Open arms
Living without you, living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you, wanting you near
How much I wanted you home
But now that you've come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay.
So now I come to you, with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping youll see what your love means to me

Saying ""damn"" to myself
I should have known the day would come
That she would find somebody else
And all the things I took her through
Shit, I shouldn't have lasted this long
Now I'm at this telephone booth calling Tyrone
Cuz when a woman's fed up
No matter how you beg, no
It ain't nothing you can do about it (Nothing you can do about it)
It's like running out of love
No matter what you say, no
And then it's too late to talk about it (Too late to talk about it)
Now let's talk about how it all goes down
I used to make love to you daily
When the night fell the same
And anytime that you were hurt
I could feel your pain
And if I had a dollar
It was yours, yeah
And whenever we would go out
I would front the bill
But now the up is down
And the silence is sound
I hurt you too too many times
Now I can't come around
Cuz when a woman's fed up
No matter how you beg, no
It ain't nothing you can do about it (Nothing you can do about it)
It's like running out of love
No matter what you say, no
And then it's too late to talk about it (Too late to talk about it)
La da da da da la la da da
La da da da da la la da da
If you don't want to find out the hard way (the hard way oh I)
Then listen to this song while the record plays
Cuz when a woman's fed up
No matter how you beg, no
It ain't nothing you can do about it (Nothing you can do about it)
It's like running out of love
No matter what you say, no
And then it's too late to talk about it (Too late to talk about it)
You can cry a river
'Till an ocean starts to form, yeah
But she will always remember
Cuz she's a woman scorned
And if you ever get her back
It will never be the same
She's cuttin' the corners of her eyes
Every time she see your face
Now your trust is out the door
She don't want you no more
You used to tell your boys, not me
And she would always be there for you
If you had took the time to see
What that woman meant to you
Is what the mirror said to me, whoa
She was raised in Illinois
Right outside of Chicago
Some of the best cookin' you ever had
Yes, it was and I miss her
Hey woman, if you're listening
I said I miss you baby

could make me the past but that I musn't fear 'cause you're here.

wish the rain just let me

Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was doggin' me
Take my name and just let me be

Happy days will drown the pain

And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine
Now you want to be free
So I'll let you fly
'Cause I know in my heart, babe
Our love will never die, no
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me?
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
I ain't gonna cry, no
And I won't beg you to stay
If you're determined to leave, boy
I will not stand in your way

You'll be back again

All my dreams I will dare
You set my heart racin' when you get next to me
Still I don't think you care
Should I wait for your love
Or am I waiting in vain?

If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong,
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong,
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong,
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

All you have to do, is have some climbing faith, oh yeah
No rivers to wide, for you to make it across
All you have to do, is believe it when you pray
And then you will see, a morning will come
And every day, will be as bright as the sun
All of your fears, just cast them on me
I just want you to see
I'll be your cloud up in the sky, I'll be your shoulder when you cry
I hear your voices when you call me, i am your angel
And when all hope is gone im here, no matter how far you are im near
It makes no difference who you are, I am your angel 
I'm your angel
I saw your teardrops and I heard you cry
All you need is time, Seek me and you shall find
You have everything and you're still lonely
It don't have to be this way, Let me show you a better day
And then you will see, a morning will come
And every day, will be as bright as the sun
All of your fears, just cast them on me

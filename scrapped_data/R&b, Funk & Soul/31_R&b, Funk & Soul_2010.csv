Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with cuffs and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossin'
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)
Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no ""Mrs.""
Buy matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction
Whoever said money can't solve your problems?
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say ""Which one?"" I say ""Nah, I want all of 'em""
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms
My smile is beamin', my skin is gleamin'
The way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)
I bought a crib just for the closet
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Baby)
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)
I got my receipts, be lookin' like phone numbers
Black card is my business card
I don't mean to brag, but I be like,
When you see them racks
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, give me the loot
Look at my neck, look at my neck
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)

To a buried and a burning flame
As love and its decisive pain

The Icarus to your certainty

With wax melt ed, I'd meet the sea

25,Nightmare,Halsey,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/halsey/nightmare-chords-2696649,"        Now I lay me down to sleep
   I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
  If I shall die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take
I, I keep a record of the wreckage of my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize
I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
Come on little lady, give us a smile
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a Goddamn thing
I, I keep a record of the wreckage of my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize
I'm no sweet dream but I'm a hell of a night
That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night
  No, I won't smile, but I'll show you my teeth
And I'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe
I've been polite, but won't be caught dead
Lettin' a man tell me what I should do in my bed
Keep my exes in check in my basement
'Cause kindness is weakness, or worse, you're complacent
I could play nice or I could be a bully
Come on little lady, give us a smile
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a Goddamn thing

But I'd rather be a real nightmare, than die unaware, yeah
Someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware
But I'm glad to be a real nightmare, so save me your prayers

Dentro questa maglia rosa non so darmi una risposta
Tu dici che è meglio se cambio maglia e carattere
Ma il tuo sorriso è la sola cosa che mi può fottere
Lascia stare, per ora non richiamare
Richiamare, richiamare, richiamare più
Tanto non fa male, fa male, fa male, fa male più
Resto qui e butto un'altra notte, cerco il Nilo nel Naviglio
Qua sono le sette, chiami in after, non rispondo
Fumando a bordo piscina
Dicevi: ""Scappiamo in Cina"", ma
Dove vado se non ci sei tu più qui vicino
Se non c'è più il Nilo
Dormo in macchina per cancellare l'alcol dalla testa
La maglia Lacoste è l'unica cosa che di te mi resta
Ma ora dimentichi i miei modi di fare da bambino
Quando la notte confondevamo sempre il Naviglio con il Nilo
Sono, ma non mi sento grande
Ti ricordi che sono di settembre, ma
Resto qui e butto un'altra notte, cerco il Nilo nel Naviglio
Qua sono le sette, chiami in after, non rispondo
Fumando a bordo piscina
Dicevi: ""Scappiamo in Cina"", ma
Dove vado se non ci sei tu più qui vicino
Se non c'è più il Nilo
Non chiamare, richiamare, richiamare, richiamare più

Don't take it personal if I can't reply now
I'm distant 'cause I don't wanna be reached now
Won't let the ghosts of our past weigh my future down
I'm liberated
Energy's like a circle, it comes back around
Reciprocated
Don't shed no more tears
Won't gain no empathy from me
In the upcoming years
Oh, I don't need your pity
Don't check on me
Oh, don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
And it looks like winter for you
Ain't call you back 'cause I let it go
I had to focus energy and just let it flow
And when we ride low, we were already gone
It wouldn't mean anymore to me now
I know it hurts you so bad just to see me happy
That I finally moved on, and you thought it wouldn't happen
At times I used to cry, when the world was laughing
But I act like I didn't notice
Oh, don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
You can't kill a flame with gasoline
Even if it feels like it every time (No matter how hard you try)
Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June
Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June

Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
“Stick to singing, stop rappin’ like it’s Christmas”
And if you’re talkin’ money then my conversation’s shiftin’
  My dreams are bigger than just bein’ on the rich list
   Might be insanity but people call it gifted
My face is goin’ numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
   Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red but looks better without the lipstick
I’m a private guy and you know nothin’ ’bout my business
And if I had my fifteen minutes, I must’ve missed them
   Twenty years old is when I came in the game
And now it’s eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well then I’m better today
But it’s ironic how you people thought I’d never be great
I like my shows open air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I’ve already got
You know it ain’t my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it’s ’bout time you remember the name
Eh-ay, eh-ay
You know it ain’t my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it’s ’bout time you remember the name
Eh-ay, eh-ay  (hey, hey, hey)
   I can still remember (what) tryna shop a deal (ah-huh)
From Taco Bell to T-R-L
I climb the Billboard charts to the top until as fate would have it (yeah)
Became an addict, funny ‘cause I had pop appeal
   But they said time would tell (what?)
If I'd prevail (huh?) and all I did was (what?)
Put nine inch nails (where?), in my eyelids now (what?)
Without a doubt by any means, if rap was skinny jeans
I couldn't do anything in 'em, I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means no ifs, ands or buts are squeezin' in between
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin’ with me in your dreams
   Not even when I’m even on my deathbed
Man I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So why would I quit, the thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head, I said it then forgot what I said
It isn't my time to call it a day
I got rap blocked and I’m already paid
But it’s ’bout time you remember the name
Eh-ay, eh-ay
You know it ain’t my time to call it a day
I got rap blocked and I’m already paid
But it’s ’bout time you remember the name
Eh-ay, eh-ay
Ain’t nobody cold as me, I dress so fresh, so clean
You can find me in my whip, rockin’ my Fendi drip
Man you know just what I mean
Shinin’ wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it
Everything my voice on, this shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It’s just another episode, my hoes, I spoil ‘em
She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit
Shit I’m gettin’ stupid money, what else we gon’ do with money?
Bitch we be ballin’ now, the king bring you 50 bottles
Tonight we gon’ blow a check, worry ’bout your shit tomorrow
The turn up be so real, we ’bout to be super lit
Boy I’m kickin’ straight facts, that’s just how we do this shit
Tomorrow we hangin’ over ’til we start feelin’ sober
Then it’s time to start it over, here we go again

And now she tells that same bitch, ''My shoes Prada
My boo bought em, I do love him''
I let my smile show 'til these bitches had enough
She let her mind roam 'cause she know I got it covered
And that's simple enough, I guess
She said, 'I dressed in your favorite
I bought two bottles of red
Unless you made reservations
Oh look, you thought all ahead, yeah

I hope one of you come back to remind me of who I was
When I go disappearing

People they can be so unkind
If they're not happy, if they can't speak their mind
But unwind the needle just to find
One more line, one more line
People they got something to say
They can be carried or be carried away
But it takes bricks and mortar, to speak your mind
So keep putting 'em down, put 'em down
That bird had song to sing, something to say
Is it still here? Or has it flown away?
This morning it had something to say
Is it still here? Or has it flown away?
It reminds of a time where my memories fade
Thoughts ain't sharp unless they're laid
But if I can't remember will I feel it again?
All I need's a piece of paper and pen
But you can take a photograph, or you can just be there
Do you need to remember? Or can you just be there?
If I kept my promise, would we still be friends?
If I remembered would I feel it again?
That bird had song to sing, something to say
Is it still here? Or has it flown away?
This morning it had something to say
Is it still here? Or has it flown away?
Sometimes I question and I wonder how I just can sing
Anger can take over mine, 'till it's carried away
But it's just not there, it don't make no sense
But I wrote it down, I wrote it down

'Cause sometimes it's better that way
Gotta let it go so your heart don't break
'Cause I love you
Yeah, baby, I love you
Just this one time hear what I'm tryna say
Know you might not feel quite the same way
But I love you
I tell you, I love you
Why? Why wait to fight?
Give it a try
Or I'll say goodbye while it's right
Can we save tears in your eyes
I'm making you cry
Why wait to hate? Can we save love?
I fell in, I'm falling, I'm for you
I can't let you fall through the floor too

 But teenage love still took my virgin skin
 And the night after my first time I cried, cause I,
I thought heaven wouldn’t let me in
 Meanwhile the priest has got a boyfriend
 And lots of teachers smoke weed after school
 When you’re young they try to keep you in the cages but
 Most of them don’t follow their own rules
Spend your whole life being graded
Being told you’re not enough
Being told go find “the one”
And sit and wait for death to come but i don’t want to
I need to talk to god
There’s things i just don’t understand
Like who am I when no ones in the room?
Who am I when no ones in the room?
Does the voice in my head that
Talks me off the ledge belong to me?
Or does it come from the clouds?
Who am I when no ones in the room?
 Go to school and get a good job
 Just to work your life away and pay your debts
 And even those who live their dreams out
Cry, cause all that glitters is not what you expect
 Sometimes i don’t want to sing no more
Slit my throat and take my music back from evil men
They can put my body in the ocean
Where i can die wearing a smile and maybe find peace again
Spend my whole life being graded
Being told i’m not enough
Being told go find ""the one""

Buttering up my consciousness
C-c-c cook  now
Ability to sleep sound throughout the star
Time's an illusion if you just remove it

Brain and heart as if they could stay alive alone?
If they were apart and you had no power, start, or no database
Only your shell remains
What fun is it to be so calculated
Or be taken advantage of 'cause your heart's too trusting?
Silent expressed, push my head into my chest
Bind them up, forever wed

Help me when I'm too detached and cold
Give me the vitality that I need to trust love more
Blood to the water, neither can fuel us alone
Fervency in my arteries, passion bloomin' through my bones

Agape loves, a journey red rivers connect all of me

That life is sweet
It swiftly goes
So I just gotta know
That it's more than lust (So in love)
That you're worth my trust (So in love)
You gotta search inside yourself
And purely open up to me
Before I'll be with you...
You gotta give me something sacred
More than merely physical (So in love)
One night's not enough
Gotta be certain
I'm so in love with you...
It's just another Saturday evening
He's watching all the girls go by
He'll find your body kind of appealing
So he hits you with his favorite lie, Yes
He's looking you over
He whispers ""Lеt's get to know each other bеtter, baby""
He's moving in closer
But what you see may not be the entirety
So be wary
He's just out for the one night
He just wants you 'til he gets his way now, baby, baby
So don't gamble with your life
It don't pay (Don't!)
(Baby, baby, baby, don't)
     You see her standing there on the corner
   Sashaying as the cars go by
You casually look over your shoulder
As she winks at you and bats her eyes
You're thinking about it
Your conscience tells you to go
But something's in the way now
The prospect's arousing
You think just this once can't hurt them
But you might have another thing coming
Baby, so later you'll forget her name (Now baby, baby)
So don't gamble with your life, it don't pay
    (Don't don't,    surely don't pay)
(Just a little advice now)
(Baby, baby)
(You'd better think twice now)
You're just out for the one night
But it's more than a little game now, baby, baby

Million people on the street
They're all living their own lives
And I'm a stranger
Just a face they'll never know
Somebody unimportant
People come and people go

The ocean's deep as the sky is tall

Make me feel like I matter, you do
'Cause I know I matter to you

I feel better being there
Like I'm somebody important

I'd meet Prince Charming with all the right features
And ride off in the sunset on a horse

'Cause I thought monsters lived under the bed
That's before I knew they walk the streets instead

47,Santas Real,Sasha Sloan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/sasha-sloan/santas-real-chords-3380612,"I used to believe in magical creatures
I'd meet Prince Charming with all the right features
And ride off in the sunset on a horse
That's before I knew about divorce
When I would go to sleep, I'd always say, ""Mom
Keep the door open and please leave the light on""
'Cause I thought monsters lived under the bed
That's before I knew they walk the streets instead
I wanna live in a world
Where peoplе don't get hurt
And everybody's got еnough money
Where nobody ever gets sick
Or has to skip a meal
I wanna live in a world where Santa's real
I used to think superheroes existed
If there was smoke in the sky, they'd come fix it
'Cause good guys always won in the end
But that's before I knew that it was all pretend
I wanna live in a world
Where people don't get hurt
And everybody's got enough money
Where nobody ever gets sick
Or has to skip a meal
I wanna live in a world where Santa's real
I used to be young and naive
Until I saw things I couldn't unsee
I wanna live in a world
Where people don't get hurt
And everybody's got enough money
Where nobody ever gets sick
Or has to skip a meal
I wanna live in a world
Where things I believed as a kid
Actually exist
And everybody's good to each other
Where nobody ever gets drunk
And gets behind the wheel
I wanna live in a world
Live in a world
I wanna live in a world where Santa's real

I hang on every word that you say
Everything that you do, baby
   In my solar system, you are the sun
Feels like my life's just begun
And I'm so glad you're mine, baby
   I'd walk with my head in the clouds
My heart from the bottom, I vow
I'll hold
You can believe for sure
I'll be nobody's man but yours, baby
I'll kiss
Nobody else's lips
My command is your every wish
You can believe, for sure
I'll be nobody's man but yours
You're the reason why I'm livin' a dream
You're all the inspiration I'll ever need
How do you do what you do, babe?
I'm flying ten feet off the ground
And I never wanna come down
I'll hold
Nobody's hand but yours
You can believe for sure
I'll be nobody's man but yours, baby
I'll kiss
Nobody else's lips
My command is your every wish

I'll be nobody's man
I'm sure no man
Has ever felt a love like this before

I am your morning ,I'm no sunshine
But you say I light up your world baby
I am your baby that you won't let go
Even If the world's go down
Don't you worry,I will be anything
Is that you wanna hear?
So call me anything
I could be everything to you
But at the same time, I'd be nothing at all
Of course, now I'm precious to you
But I will still be needing time to have faith in you
For you I am burning, fastest I could
For our loving
I would have nothing, I'm very passionate
I know so do you, my darling
I am belonging Like the sky above us includes the clouds and a sun
I would be raining and be pouring through you
Is that you wanna hear? I'm telling everything
I could be everything to you
But at the same time, I'd be nothing at all
Of course, now I'm precious to you
But I will still be needing time to have faith in you
I'm telling everything, so be my everything
I could be anything, tell me everything you need

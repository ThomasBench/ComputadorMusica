0,The Door,Keb' Mo',https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/keb-mo/the-door-chords-4095502,"I was down for so long
Everything I did was wrong
And I found fault
In everyone but me
I was hurt and alone
I could not find my way home
Broke-down and hungry
And too tired to moan
Then I heard somebody calling my name
Saying ain't no need to be shamed
I found out that the door was always open
I was trapped in my mind
A prisoner of my own design
Lost in a world
A world of confusion
I was there by myself
Couldn't find no help nowhere else
Thought I'd call up the hotline
But there was nobody there
Then I heard somebody calling my name
Saying ain't no need to be shamed
I found out that the door was always open
Then I heard somebody calling my name
Saying ain't no need to be shamed
I found out that the door was always open

It's been a minute since I saw you, boy
Must admit, it's good to hear your voice
And I guess that I forgot just how you make me feel when you're around
See you haven't lost your sense of style
And you still could melt me with your smile
Can't deny that I still got these feelings deep inside
It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again
I look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
And I realize, I've never gotten over you
Every time I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby, here I go again (ooh ooh ooh)
Here I go again
Still remember how you make me weak
How I fought to find the words to speak
I just can't escape the memories
I tried, but I just can't break free
Thought I closed the door on what we had
But these feelings just keep coming back
 Didn't think that you could make me lose control like that
It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again
I look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
And I realize, I've never gotten over you
Every time I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby, here I go again (ooh ooh ooh)
Here I go again
Sweet lovin' is my ting, so you know mi got fi swing
That's why yuh request it again without a doubt yuh want to spend
And to experience it again because yuh love the way yuh felt back then
So make me light it up again, reignite the flames again
'Cause I really miss 'dem days when we used to chill
Up on the hill watch the sun set in West Negril
Girl yuh Bajan beauty it a gimme di chill
Not to mention the way you are within'
It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game?

Ohh ohh ehh
Once was a time you and I
Made a promise 'til the day we die
I trusted each and every word
Never thinking that I'd get burned
Silly me, I believed in your fairy tales
Boy, I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride, all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time
There's no time to give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye
Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, now this song is through
The things you said, I can never forget
The things you did fill my heart with regret
But I'm still standing tall as I walk away
And you know that it's true when you hear me say
It's over, it's through, ain't a thing you can do, boy
It's sad, but it's true
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this

I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies

How's your mother, how's your little brother?
Does he still look just like you?
So many things I wanna know the answers to
Wish I could press rewind
  And rewrite every line
To the story of me and you
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried
To get you out my mind
But it don't get no better
As each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused
I've got nothin to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S. I'm still not over you
Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on
But there's a lot of feelings that remain since you've been gone
I guess you thought that I would put it all behind me
But it seems there's always somethin right there to remind me
Like a silly joke, or somethin on the t.v.
Boy it aint easy  
When I hear our song
I get that same old feeling
Wish I could press rewind
  Turn back the hands of time
And I shouldn't be telling you
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried
To get you out my mind
But it don't get no better
As each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused
I've got nothin to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S. I'm still not over you
Did you know I kept all of your pictures
Don't have the strength to part with them yet
Tried to erase the way your kisses taste
But some things a girl can never forget
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried
To get you out my mind
But it don't get no better
As each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused
I've got nothin to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S. I'm still not over you

14,A Million Miles Away,Rihanna,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/rihanna/a-million-miles-away-chords-873428,"Here we lay face to face once again
Silence cuts like a knife as we pretend.
And I'm wondering who will be the first to say what we both know
We're just holding on to ""could have been""s and we should be letting go.
It feels like you're a million miles away as you're lying here with me tonight.
I can't even find the words to say I can find a way to make it right.
And we both know that the story's ending,
We play the part but we're just pretending.
And I can't hide the tears
'cause even though you're here,
It feels like you're a million miles away.
Was it me, or was it you that broke away?
For what we were is like a season love is change
And every time I think about it, it tears me up inside.
Like the rivers of emotion but I got no more tears to cry.
It feels like you're a million miles away as you're lying here with me tonight.
I can't even find the words to say I can find a way to make it right.
And we both know that the story's ending,
We play the part but we're just pretending.
And I can't hide the tears
'cause even though you're here,
It feels like you're a million miles away.
We can try to talk it over but we walked that road before,
While our song is playing its last note,
We both know for sure that it's time to close that door.

   I love you.
I love you.
   Baby, I love you.
You are my life.
My happiest moments weren't complete if you weren't by my side.
You're my relation, in connection to the sun.
With you next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome.
You are my raindrops, I am the sea.
With you and God who's my sunlight, I bloom and grow so beautifully.
Baby, I'm so proud, proud to be your girl.
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and messed up world.
 I am in love with you,  you set me free.
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me.
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you.
I'll never leave, just keep loving me.
The way I love you, loving me.
'Cause I am in love with you,  you set me free.
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me.
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you.
I'll never leave just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me.
   And I know you love me,
Love me for who I am. 'Cause years before, I became who I am.
Baby, you were my man
I know it ain't easy, easy loving me.
I appreciate the love and dedication from you to me.
Later on in my destiny, I see myself having your child.
I see myself being your wife, and I see my whole future in your eyes.
The thought of all my love for you, sometimes makes me wanna cry.
I realize all my blessings, I'm grateful to have you by my side
 I am in love with you,  you set me free.
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me.
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you.
I'll never leave, just keep loving me.
The way I love you, loving me.
'Cause I am in love with you,  you set me free.
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me.
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you.
I'll never leave just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me.
    Every time I see your face, my heart smiles.
Every time it feels so good, it hurts sometimes.
Created in this world to love, to hold, to feel, to breathe, to live you,
    Dangerously in love.
 I am in love with you,  you set me free.
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me.
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you.
I'll never leave, just keep loving me.
The way I love you, loving me.
'Cause I am in love with you,  you set me free.
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me.
'Cause I'm dangerously in love with you.
I'll never leave just, just keep loving me
The way I love you, loving me.

There's no more you and I

Should just been a man about it

A solitary glance
And I could hear the voice of rapture call
I've loved you from a distance
Afraid to take a chance
And now it seems I can't help but to fall
Imagine my surprise
To open up my eyes
 And find that you were looking back
And suddenly
I can not remember who I used to be
And like the rain this yearning washes over me
And all the pain I knew before is gone
And suddenly
I'm no longer drifting on an empty sea
And now I know that I believe in destiny
And mine is waiting right here in your arms
I longed to awake besides you
And bathe in love's abyss
Washing all that comes before away
And in this frozen moment as I receive your kiss
There will not be words enough to say
I wanna make you melt, touch you like no one else
And do it all again a thousand times
And suddenly
I can not remember who I used to be
And like the rain this yearning washes over me
And all the pain I knew before is gone

We ask the old man what is the time
The time he said I do not know
The clock stopped working sometime ago
What a disaster was our reply
We don't know if its 1 o'clock or half past 5
The man kept talking things were fine
Looking to the sky he said the time was for
Reason and rhyming
Reason and Rhyme, rhyme and reason
We asked the old lady what is the season
The season she said you can't be sure
The weather is strange can't tell you anymore
Woh my god woh my god woh my god
What a thing we don't know if its
Summer autumn winter or spring
But when she said this might be pleasing
The time has come for rhyming and reason
Rhyme and reason and destination
We ask ourselves what is this nation
This place they say is no mans land
And terranaleous is written in the sand
So what with all these spaces
Can't we be independent?
And combine the races
Well we will see what we can do
Like time and season
We will rhyme and reason along

Right the temp'rature is warm the fire horses
Sleep so gently comes the
Night now close your eyes a-stare the ground they're on is
Bare but once it was as deep and wild as giant's
Dreams it's no longer
There and all of our de-sires could mirror skies with
Flames and smoke out heaven's halls and who was that you
Called they're no longer there
  Ah-here it goes a-gain oh-here it goes a-
gain here it goes a-gain__
  Now what would you leave behind when all your fields are dead when your
Territ'ries are dried out and your cities drowned and swept a-what would you
Leave behind when those who'll bear your name are born in that place that you
Wrecked     and what would you leave behind__ when you're no longer
There
  And would you sail to distant shores and hide within the
Haze and softly close your door pre-tend the world was
Saved and wait for heaven's
Call or would you turn and face the seas  and calm beside you
Care there's chance but if you dare and swift as honest
Deeds before it's no longer there__
  Ah-here it goes a-gain oh-here it goes a-
gain here it goes a-gain__

Change 'cos where the one for-gets the world begins to
Fade and all the shapes and shades that made the colour

Tonight I see the sunny moon is rising again
Three seasons passed since you were here then disappeared a friend
Yet now exploded from it's dream back in that place oh how it beams
And I see that you were glowing in the shadows
And you've been here all along
Ah you never left my side and now I feel my arms grow
Stronger
You may forget the details and you can forget the dates but never
Forget the moment when the light revealed her face
To be poor by lack of money but by god be rich in prize
I found my youths desire dark within her eyes
And the tent kept breathing something and then she cried –
'Hold on we're going somewhere else tonight
We're going somewhere else tonight baby yeh!

And though everyone has a weakness only some they are defiant
While most of us can see only a few have the gift of sight

Would you walk with me alone into the night

Quante principesse nel castello mi hai nascosto
TI VOGLIO BENE...te lo dicevo anche se non spesso
TI VOGLIO BENE...me ne accorgevo prima più di adesso
Tre sono poche..quattro sono troppe
Quante quelle cose che hai rinchiuso nel castello e ancora?
TI VOGLIO BENE...e nonostante tutte le attenzioni
TI VOGLIO BENE...dall?altro ieri invece da domani non lo so
Vorrei ringraziarti vorrei stringerti alla gola
Sono quello che ascoltavi, quello che sempre consola
Sono quello che chiamavi se piangevi ogni sera
Sono quello che un po? odi e che ora un po? ti fa paura
Vorrei ricordarti che ti son stato vicino
Anche quella sera quando ti sentivi strano
E ho sopportato
Perché ormai secondo te ho tutto quello che mi serve
Un applauso forte sotto le mie note
Una copertina ed anche un video forte
Fidanzate tante quante se piovesse
Anche se poi le paure son le stesse
Ora che ho sempre tantissimo da fare
Dici che non ho più tempo per parlare
Ma se solo bisbigliando te lo chiedo
Tu sarcastico ti tiri sempre indietro
Un altro viaggio e poco tempo per decidere
Chi ha caldo a volte non si fermerebbe mai
È troppo presto per ricominciare a ridere
Sicuramente il momento arriverà
Sono passati lentamente venti giorni
Sono trascorsi rimpiangendo i miei sogni
E in quanto a te so solo che se ti vedessi
Sarei più stronzo di ciò che ti aspettassi
È terminata l?amicizia da due ore
Ho seppellito l?incoscienza del mio cuore
In 4/4 ti racconto
L?allegria e la magia che hai rovinato
Ti ho visto camminare mezzo metro sopra al suolo
Dire in giro ?sono amico di Tiziano?
E rassicurarmi di starmi vicino
Poi chiacchierare al telefono da solo
Dietro l?ombra di sorrisi e gesti accorti
Sono passati faticando i nostri giorni
E per quanto non sopporti più il tuo odore
Mi fa male dedicarti il mio rancore
E? che ti sono debitore di emozioni
E? che al mondo non ci sono solo buoni
Magari questo lo sapevo ma è diverso
Viverlo sulla tua pelle come ho fatto io con te
E fu Latina a farci unire e poi pagare
Una canzone può anche non parlar d?amore
E ancora con tutto il cuore te lo dico
Anche se da due settimane non sei più

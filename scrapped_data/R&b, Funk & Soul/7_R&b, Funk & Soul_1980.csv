0,Cinnamon Girl,Prince,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/prince/cinnamon-girl-chords-565664,"As war drums beat in Babylon
Cinnamon Girl starts 2 pray
I'd never heard a prayer like this one
Never before that day
Tearful words of love 4 people she had never met before
Asking God 2 grant them mercy in this phase of holy war
Cinnamon Girl
Cinnamon Girl
Cinnamon Girl of mixed heritage
Never knew the meaning of color lines
911 turned that all around
When she got accused of this crime
So began the mass illusion, war on terror, alibi
What's the use when the god of confusion keeps on telling the same lie?
Cinnamon Girl
Cinnamon Girl
Don't cry, don't shed no tears
One lie won't make us fear
Cinnamon Girl
Cinnamon Girl
As war drums beat in Babylon
And scorch the blood red sky
Militants bomb the foreign gun
Both sides, children die
Cinnamon Girl opens the book she knows will settle all the scores
Then she prays after the war that there will not be any more
Cinnamon Girl
Cinnamon Girl
Cinnamon Girl
Cinnamon Girl

Played once too often

Of lifes imperfections
Is it so wrong
To be human after all
Drawn into the stream
Of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They cant disguise the truth
That there is something about you
Baby so right
I wouldnt be without you
Baby tonight
If ever our love 
No one can say that
A million things
And a perfect dream of life
Fragile but free
Tender together 
And its not so wrong
Were only human after all
These changing years
They add to your confusion
Oh and you need to hear
The time that told the truth
You know theres something about you

Because theres something about you
Baby so right
I couldnt live without you

 Hear her voice, shake my window; Sweet se-ducing sighs.
 Get me out, into the night-time; Four walls won't hold me, to-night.
 If this town, is just an apple;
 Then let me take a bite. (If they say);
 Why? why? Tell them that its human nature.
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? (If they say)
 Why? why? Tell them that it’s human nature.
 Why? why? Does he do me that way?
 Reaching out, to touch a stranger; Electric eyes are every-where.
 See that girl; she knows I'm watching,
 She likes the way I stare. (If they say)

Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one,

And don`t go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me, be careful who you love,

For forty days and forty nights, law was on her side
But who can stand when she`s in demand, her schemes and plans
Cause we danced on the floor in the round.
So take my strong advice: Just remember to always think twice
She told my baby we danced till three, and she looked at me,
Then showed a photo. My baby cried, his eyes were like mine.
Can we dance on the floor in the round?

You start to freeze, as horror looks you right between the eyes;
You're para-lyzed.
'Cos this is; Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike.
You know it's; Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
You're fighting for your life, inside a killer, Thriller, to-night.
You hear the door slam, and realise there's nowhere left to run.
You feel the cold hand, and wonder if you'll ever see the sun.
You close your eyes, and hope that this is just imagi-nation.
But all the while, you hear the creature creepin' up be-hind;
You're out of time.
'Cos this is; Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
There ain't no second chance to kill the thing with forty eyes, girl.
 Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
You're fighting for your life, inside a killer, Thriller, to-night.
 Night creatures call and the dead start to walk in their masquerade.
 There's no escapin' the jaws of the alien, this time;
 This is the end of your life.
 They're out to get you; there's demons closing in on every side.
They will pos-sess you; unless you change the number on your dial.
Now is the time, for you and I to cuddle close to-gether.
All through the night, I'll save you from the terror on the screen;
I'll make you see...
That this is; Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
'Cos I can thrill you more than any ghost would dare try.
 Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
So let me hold you tight, and share a killer,
 Diller, chiller, Thriller here to-night.
That this is; Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
'Cos I can thrill you more than any ghost would dare try.
 Thril-ler, Thril-ler Night;
So let me hold you tight, and share a killer, thriller, ow!
 ...I'm gonna thrill you tonight.
 Darkness falls across the land, the midnight hour is close at hand.
 Creatures crawl in search of blood, to terrorise your neighbourhood.
 And whosoever shall be found, without the soul for getting down,
Must stand and face the Hounds of Hell and rot inside a corpse's shell.
The foulest stench is in the air; the funk of forty thousand years,
And grizzy ghouls from every tomb, are closing in to seal your doom.
 And though you fight to stay alive; your body starts to shiver,
For no mere mortal can resist, the evil of The Thriller...
 They told him; don't you ever come around here;
Don't wanna see your face; you better disappear.
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear,
So beat it, just beat it.
 You better run, you better do what you can;
Don't wanna see no blood; don't be a macho man.
You wanna be tough; better do what you can,
So beat it; but you wanna be bad.
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it;
 No one wants to be de-feated.
 Showin' how funky and strong, is your fight,
 It doesn't matter, who's wrong or right;
Just beat it, beat it, just beat, beat it.
Just beat it, beat it, just beat, beat it.
 They're out to get you; better leave while you can;
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man.
You wanna stay alive; better do what you can,
So beat it, just beat it.
 You have to show them that you're really not scared;
You're playin' with your life; this ain't no truth or dare.
They'll kick you, then they beat you, then they'll tell you its fair;
So beat it; but you wanna be bad.
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it;
 No one wants to be de-feated.
 Showin' how funky and strong, is your fight,
 It doesn't matter, who's wrong or right.
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it;
 No one wants to be de-feated.
 Showin' how funky and strong, is your fight,
 It doesn't matter, who's wrong or right.
Just beat it, beat it, beat it.

 Showin' how funky and strong, is your fight,
 It doesn't matter, who's wrong or right.

 It doesn't matter, who's wrong or right.
 She was more like a beauty queen, from a movie scene,
 I said; don't mind, but what do you mean; I am the one?
Who will dance on the floor, in the round.
She said; I am the one, who will dance on the floor, in the round.
 She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene.
 Then every head turned, with eyes that dreamed of being the one,
Who will dance on the floor, in the round.
 People always told me; be careful what you do;
And don't go around breaking young girl's hearts.
And mother always told me; be careful of who you love;
And be careful of what you do, 'cos the lie becomes the truth.
 Billie Jean is not my lover;
 She's just a girl who, claims that I am the one.
But the kid is not my son.
She says; I am the one, but the kid is not my son.
 For forty days and forty nights, the law was on her side.
 But who can stand, when she's in demand, her schemes and plans?
'Cos we danced on the floor, in the round.
So take my strong a-dvice; just remember to always think twice.
(Do think twice, do think twice).
 She told my baby we'd danced 'till three, then she looked a me,
 Then showed a photo; my baby cried; his eyes looked like mine.
Go on dance on the floor, in the round, baby.
 People always told me; be careful what you do;
And don't go around breaking young girl's hearts.
She came and stood right by me; then the smell of sweet perfume.
This happened much too soon; she called me to her room.
 Billie Jean is not my lover;
 She's just a girl who, claims that I am the one.
But the kid is not my son.
 Billie Jean is not my lover;
 She's just a girl who, claims that I am the one.
But the kid is not my son.

 Billie Jean is not my lover;
 She's just a girl who, claims that I am the one.

She says; I am the one, but the kid is not my son.
She says; I am the one, but the kid is not my son.
She says; I am the one,
She says he is my son.
She says; I am the one.
 Billie Jean is not my lover,
 Billie Jean is not my lover.
 Billie Jean is not my lover,
 Billie Jean is not my lover.
 Looking out, across the night-time;
 The city winks a sleepless eye.
 Hear her voice, shake my window;
 Sweet se-ducing sighs.
 Get me out, into the night-time;
 Four walls won't hold me, to-night.
 If this town, is just an apple;
 Then let me take a bite. (If they say);
 Why? why? Tell them that its human nature.
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? (If they say);
 Why? why? Tell them that its human nature.
 Why? why? Does he do me that way?
 Reaching out, to touch a stranger;
 Electric eyes are every-where.
 See that girl; she knows I'm watching,
 She likes the way I stare. (If they say):
 Why? why? Tell them that its human nature.
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? (If they say);
 Why? why? Tell them that its human nature.
 Why? why? Does he do me that way?
I like livin' this way,
I like lovin' this way.           That way.
 Looking out, a-cross the morning,
 The city's heart begin to beat.
 Reaching out, I touch her shoulder;
 I'm dreaming of the street. (If they say):
 Why? why? Tell them that its human nature.
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? (If they say);
 Why? why?
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? (If they say);
 Why? why? Ta da da da, cha cha cha cha.
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? (If they say);
 Why? why? 
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? (If they say);
 Why? why?
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? (If they say);
 Why? why? Ta da da da, ta da ta da.
 Why? why? Does he do me that way? I like livin' this way.
 Where did you come from, lady, and ooh, won't you take me there?
 Right away, won't you, baby?
 Tendoroni, you've got to be; spark my nature; sugar, fly with me.
Don't you know; now is the perfect time?
 We can make it right; hit the city lights.
Then to-night, ease the lovin' pain;
 Let me take you to the max.
I want to love you, (P.Y.T.), Pretty Young Thing,
 You need some lovin', (T.L.C.), Tender lovin' care.
 And I'll... take you there.
I want to love you, (P.Y.T.), Pretty Young Thing,
 You need some lovin', (T.L.C.), Tender lovin' care.
 And I'll... take you there.
 Anywhere you wanna go.
 Nothin' can stop this burnin',
De-sire to be with you; gotta get to you baby.
 Won't you come? It's emergency;
Cool my fire yearnin', honey; come set me free.
Don't you know; now is the perfect time?
 We can dim the lights, just to make it right.
In the night; hit the lovin' spot;
 I'll give you all I've got.
I want to love you, (P.Y.T.), Pretty Young Thing,
 You need some lovin', (T.L.C.), Tender lovin' care.
 And I'll... take you there.

 Pretty young things, repeat after me,
 I'll take you there, take you there.
I want to love you, (P.Y.T.), Pretty Young Thing,
 You need some lovin', (T.L.C.), Tender lovin' care.
 And I'll... take you there, take you there.
I want to love you, (P.Y.T.), Pretty Young Thing,
 You need some lovin', (T.L.C.), Tender lovin' care.
 And I'll... take you there, take you there.
 There'll be no darkness to-night;
 Lady our love, will shine,
 (Lighting the light).
 Just put your trust in my heart,
And meet me in para-dise.
 (Now is the time). Girl...
 You're every wonder in this world to me;
 A treasure time won't steal a-way.
 So listen to my heart; lay your body close to mine,
Let me fill you with my dreams; I can make you feel all right.
 And baby, through the years; gonna love you, more each day,
So I promise you, to-night; that you'll always be the lady in my life.
 Lay back in my tenderness;
 Let's make this a night, we won't for-get.
Girl, I need your sweet caress.
 Reach out to a fantasy;
 Two hearts, in the beat of ecsta-sy; come to me, girl...
 And I will keep you warm, through the shadows of the night,
Let me touch you with my love; I can make you feel so right.
 And baby, through the years; even when we're old and grey;
I will love you, more each day, 'cos you will always be the lady in my life.

I was walking down the street one day
when I looked up, I saw a friend.
Hey Frankie,  do you remember me?
He looked at me and then I blushed
'Cause I remembered I loved you so much
way back when we were friends
going together but then you left me.
Frankie,    do you remember me?
Frankie,    do you remember?
You were fifteen, I was twelve,
it was summer, we were so in love.
I never loved anyone this much
Look at me I'm thrilled to your touch.
Hey Frankie,    do you remember me?
Frankie,     do you remember?
Oh how you brought me down.
All I did was run a -round.
You'll never know, how much I loved you.
Frankie, do you remember?
Do you remember me?   Frankie
He walked me to the deli then.
We sat in the booth where it all began.
I looked into your big eyes and
I said to myself, we coulda had twins.

That a star would guide you my way
To share with me this special day
Where a rib- bon's   in   the sky___for our love
If allowed, may I touch your hand,
And if pleased, may I once again
So that you too will under-stand
There's a rib-  bon    in    the sky__for our love.
This is not a co-inci-dence
and far more than a lucky chance
But what is__ that was always meant
Is a rib-   bon     in     the  sky     for our love…   Love,
We can't lose with God on our side.
We'll find strength in each tear we cry.
From now on it will be you and I
And a rib-  bon   in    the   sky,
Rib-bon in the sky,
A rib- bon    in    the  sky___ for our love
There's a rib-  bon   in    the  sky    for our love.

I've been holding for a long time
And you've been running for a long time
It's time to do what we have to do
           That girl, That girl
That girl knows every single man
Would ask her for her hand
But she says her love is much too deep
For them to understand
She says her love has been crying out
But her lover hasn't heard
But what she doesn't realize is that I've listened to every word
That's why I know I'll tell that I love her

That my mind, soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to, that I want to

Whether time would make us strangers or whether time would make us grow

Empty skies say try to forget
Better advice is to have no regrets
As I tread the boulevard floor
Will I see you once more?
Because you've clouded my mind
'Till then I'm biding my time.
I'm only sad in a natural way
And I enjoy sometimes feeling this way
The gift you gave is desire
The match that started my fire
Empty nights with nothing to do
I sit and think, ev'ry thought is for you
I get so restless and bored
So I go out once more.
I hate to feel so confined
Feel like I'm wasting my time
I'm only sad in a natural way
And I enjoy sometimes feeling this way
The gift you gave is desire
The match that started my fire
The match that started my fire
The match that started my fire
The match that started my fire

I finally took a moment and I'm realizing that,
You're not coming back.
And it finally hit me all at once.
All at once,
I started counting teardrops and at least a million fell.
My eyes began to swell,
And all my dreams were shattered all at once.
   Ever since I met you,
You're the only  love I've known,
And I can't forget you,
Though I must face it all alone.
All at once,
I'm drifting on a lonely sea,
Wishing you'd come back to me,
All that's all that matters now.
All at once,
I'm drifting on a lonely sea,
Holding on to memories,
And it hurts me more than you know,
So much more that it shows all at once.
All at once,
I looked around and found that you were with another love,
In someone else's arms,
And all my dreams were shattered all at once.
All at once,
The smile that used to greet me, brightens someone else's day,
She took your smile away,
And left me with just memories all at once.
   Ever since I met you,
You're the only  love I've known,
And I can't forget you,
Though I must face it all alone.

How to chase my blues away

It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls, loneliness calls
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
  With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
  With somebody who loves me

Spinning through the town
  Sooner or later the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
  I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls, my lonely heart calls
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody
  With somebody who loves me
Oh, I wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat!

Somebody who loves me
Somebody who, somebody who

0,Wake Up Alone (ver 2),Amy Winehouse,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/amy-winehouse/wake-up-alone-chords-968288," It's okay in the day; I'm staying busy.
 Tied up enough so I don't have to wonder where is he.
Got so sick of crying, so just lately;
When I catch myself, I do a 1-80.
 I stay up clean the house; at least I'm not drinking.
 Run around just so I don't have to think a-bout thinking.
That silent sense of content that everyone gets,
 Just disappears soon as the sun sets.
 This face in my dreams, seizes my guts;
 He floods me with dread.
 Soaked in soul, he swims in my eyes, by the bed.
 Pour myself over him; moon spilling in,
 And I wake up a-lone.
 If I was my heart, I'd rather be restless.
The second I stop, the sleep catches up and I'm breathless.
This ache in my chest, as my day is done now.
The dark covers me and I cannot run now.
 My blood running cold; I stand before him.
 It's all I can do to as-sure him.
When he comes to me, I drip for him tonight.
 Drowning in me, we bathe under blue light.
 This face in my dreams, seizes my guts;
 He floods me with dread.
 Soaked in soul, he swims in my eyes by the bed.
 Pour myself over him; moon spilling in,
 And I wake up a-lone.
 And I wake up a-lone.
 And I wake up a-lone.
 And I wake up a-lone.

You see you can’t just play with people’s feelings

If I could get another chance
Another walk, another dance with him
I'd play a song that would never, ever end
How I'd love my mother to dance with my father again
When I and my mother would disagree
To get my way I would run from her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me, yeah, yeah
Then finally make me do just what my mama said
Later that night when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he
Would be gone from me
If I could steal one final glance
One final step, one final dance with him
I'd play a song that would never, ever end
cause i'd love my mother to dance with my father
again
Sometimes I'd listen outside her door
And I'd hear my mama cryin' for him
I pray for her even more than me
I pray for her even more than me
I know I'm prayin' for much too much
But could You send back the only man she loved
I know You don't do it usually

I would be be-hind him.
Straight, shook up beside him, with strength he didn't know.
It's you I'm fighting for.
 He can't lose with me in tow, I refuse to let him go.
 At his side and drunk on pride, we wait for the blo-ow.
 We put it in writing, but who you writing for?
Just us on kitchen floor.
Justice done, reciting, my stomach standing still,
Like you're reading my will.
 He still stands, in spite of what his scars say,
 I'll battle, 'till this bit-ter finale.
 Just me, my dignity, and this guitar case.
 Yes, if my man is fighting, some un-holy war,
And I will stand beside you.
But who you fighting for? B, I would have died too; I'd of liked to.
If my man was fight-ing,
Some un-holy war.
If my man was fighting.

It's too close for comfort
It's a thief in the night
To come and grab you
It can creep up inside you
And consume you
A disease of the mind
It can control you
I feel like a monster
Throw on your brake lights
We're in the city of wonder
Ain't gonna play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter, be wise
Your mind's in disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia
Am I scaring you tonight

Ain't used to what you like

You did too much E;  met somebo-dy,
And spent the night getting caned.
Without girls like you, there'd be no fun;
We'd go to the club, and not see any-one.
Without girls like you, there's no night-life,
All those men just go home to their wives.

I said 'you don't know what love is get a grip'
Sounds as if you're reading from some other tired script
I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just wanna grip your body over mine
Please tell me why you think that's a crime
Cuz I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, n' you my lady boy
You should be stronger than me...
You should be stronger than me...
You should be stronger than me...
You should be stronger than me...

When I catch myself, I do a 1-80.
 I stay up clean the house; at least I'm not drinking.
 Run around just so I don't have to think a-bout thinking.
That silent sense of content that everyone gets,
 Just disappears soon as the sun sets.
 This face in my dreams, seizes my guts;
 He floods me with dread.
 Soaked in soul, he swims in my eyes, by the bed.
 Pour myself over him; moon spilling in,
 And I wake up a-lone.
 If I was my heart, I'd rather be restless.
The second I stop, the sleep catches up and I'm breathless.
This ache in my chest, as my day is done now.
The dark covers me and I cannot run now.
 My blood running cold; I stand before him.
 It's all I can do to as-sure him.
When he comes to me, I drip for him tonight.
 Drowning in me, we bathe under blue light.

A misconception, a vast deception,
Something got to change

47,Ordinary People (ver 3),John Legend,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-legend/ordinary-people-chords-1094162,"Girl im in love with you
This ain't the honeymoon
Past the infatuation phase
Right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue everyday
I know i misbehaved
And you made your mistakes
And we both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow
This ain't a movie no
No fairy tale conclusion ya'll
It gets more confusing everyday
Sometimes it's heaven sent
Then we head back to hell again
We kiss then we make up on the way
I hang up you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away
As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I Still want you to stay
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow
Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe you'll stay, maybe you'll leave,
Maybe another fight
But maybe we'll grow
We never know baby youuuu and I
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Heyyy)
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
Cuz we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow (Take it slow oh oh ohh)
This time we'll take it slow

48,Amen Omen,Ben Harper,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/ben-harper/amen-omen-chords-50506,"What started as a whisper
slowly turn into a scream
searhing for an answer
where the question is unseen
I don't know where you came from
and I don't know where you've gone
old friends become old strangers
between the darkness and the dawn
Amen Omen
will I see your face again
Amen omen
can I find a place within
to live my life
without you
I still hear you saying
all of life, it is chance
and is sweetest,
is sweetest, with any glance
but I live I live a hundred
a hundred life times
but I die a little
in every breathe that I take
Amen Omen
will I see your face again
Amen omen
can I find a place within
to live my life
without you
Listen to a whisper
slowly drift away
silence is the loudest
parting word, you never say
I put, I put your world
into my veins
and now a voiceless sympathy is all
that remains
Amen Omen
will I see your face again
Amen omen
can I find a place within
to live my life
without you

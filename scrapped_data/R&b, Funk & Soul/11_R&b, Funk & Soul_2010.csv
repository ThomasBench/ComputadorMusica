Thinkin' about her
She's gone all the time
I think if you found her
Even you would know...
So baby packed up all she had,
Promised to never come back,
She left me alone and without,
Skin i could study about,
Tiles get colder to touch,
Wood splinters, metal will rust,
But baby, she had all my trust,
I guess that was never enough.
Thinkin about her

Even you would know...

But I don't mind, I don't mind
And I know that she's capable of anything, it's riveting
But when you wake up she's always gone, gone, gone
In the night she hears him calling
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain

Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)

He was cold and he was so unforgiving
Now she dances to the song on the minute
Yeah, all the time, all the time
It make her weak when she hear it
And it got her on her knees like religion
She was young and she was forced to be a woman
Yeah, all the time, all the time

Can't help but check my phone
I could have made you mine
But no it wasn't meant to be and see I wasn't made for you and you weren't made for me
Though it seemed so easy...
And that's because I wanna be your favourite boy
I wanna be the one that makes your day
The one you think about as you lie awake
I can't wait to be your number one
I'll be your biggest fan and you'll be mine
But I still wanna break your heart and make you cry...
But won't you wait
You know it's too late
I'm on my own shit now
Let me tell you how it feels to be fucking great
I feel great
Woah oh oh oh oh
You need to be yourself
Love someone for loving you instead of someone really cool that makes your heart melt
Who knows what you truly felt
You're still my favourite girl
You better trust me when I tell you there ain't no one else more beautiful in this damn world
In this damn world...
You're gonna wanna be my best friend baby
You're gonna wanna be my best friend
You're gonna wanna be my best friend baby

I wanna be the one...
I might just be the one...

 But your book ran of pages
 And now I wish I never waited
 To tell you out of all the moments in my life
The ones I got to share with you were probably my favourite
 I know you're looking down on us
Yeah I'm missing you bro ,I hope you're proud of us
At least I know you made it home
And I know you're not alone
Cause now you're singing with the choir
Now you're dancing with a crew
You ain't doing this solo
We all ridin' with you
No one can put out your fire
Nobody filling your shoes
Cause now you're singing with the choir
We all ridin' with you
 Yeah, yeah we fill up all our days with
 Workin' and grindin' just to make ends meet
 Too busy to call we'll catch up next week
And then it gets to next week and we say maybe next week
 And then before you know
We all feeling old asking ourselves
Where did my friends go
So don't wait till they go home
Cause now you're singing with the choir
Now you're dancing with a crew
You ain't doing this solo
We all ridin' with you
No one can put out your fire
Nobody filling your shoes
Cause now you're singing with the choir
We all ridin' with you
 Someday I know my friend
I'm gonna see you again
And when I do you better have a part for me
You sing the melody and I'll take the harmony
 Cause we ain't done making music yet
We got some more sound checks
And this time we gonna have about a million voices
Singing, dancing , Party in your mansion
Cause now you're singing with the choir
Now you're dancing with a crew
You ain't doing this solo
We all ridin' with you
No one can put out your fire
Nobody filling your shoes

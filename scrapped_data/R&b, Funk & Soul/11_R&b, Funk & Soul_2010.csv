She's gone all the time

Even you would know...
So baby packed up all she had,
Promised to never come back,
She left me alone and without,
Skin i could study about,
Tiles get colder to touch,
Wood splinters, metal will rust,
But baby, she had all my trust,
I guess that was never enough.

But I don't mind, I don't mind
And I know that she's capable of anything, it's riveting
But when you wake up she's always gone, gone, gone
In the night she hears him calling
In the night she's dancing to relieve the pain

Dollar bills and tears keep falling down her face
She'll never walk away (I don't think you understand)

He was cold and he was so unforgiving
Now she dances to the song on the minute
Yeah, all the time, all the time

And it got her on her knees like religion
She was young and she was forced to be a woman
Yeah, all the time, all the time

Can't help but check my phone
I could have made you mine
But no it wasn't meant to be and see I wasn't made for you and you weren't made for me
Though it seemed so easy...
And that's because I wanna be your favourite boy
I wanna be the one that makes your day
The one you think about as you lie awake
I can't wait to be your number one
I'll be your biggest fan and you'll be mine
But I still wanna break your heart and make you cry...
But won't you wait
You know it's too late
I'm on my own shit now
Let me tell you how it feels to be fucking great
I feel great
Woah oh oh oh oh
You need to be yourself
Love someone for loving you instead of someone really cool that makes your heart melt
Who knows what you truly felt
You're still my favourite girl
You better trust me when I tell you there ain't no one else more beautiful in this damn world
In this damn world...
You're gonna wanna be my best friend baby
You're gonna wanna be my best friend

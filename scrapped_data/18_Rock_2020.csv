I don't have cold feet but it's hard to read you babe
Are we turning left and are we feeling right
Can we take the next step, too many red lights
Was it too rude to just allude
Picture us nude on Sunday afternoons
Was it too rude to just allude
scrabble in my room
Oh I love you whole
You're like gold to me
My love is dirt cheap
And you had me sold
I love you whole
You're like gold to me
My love is dirt cheap
And you had me sold
I love you whole
You're like gold to me
My love is dirt cheap
And you had me sold
I love you whole
You're like gold to me
My love is dirt cheap
With you I feel the difference when you are away
You wanna roll a spliff but it's the middle of the day
And is there a time limit on how long I get to keep ya
Oh I know I'm a beast but you're the perfect creature
Was it too rude to just allude
Picture us nude on Sunday afternoons
Is it too rude, just picture us nude
Happy with a view
Oh I love you whole
You're like gold to me
My love is dirt cheap
And you had me sold
I love you whole
You're like gold to me
My love is dirt cheap
And you had me sold
I love you whole
You're like gold to me
My love is dirt cheap
And you had me sold
I love you whole
You're like gold to me
My love is dirt cheap

1,Sawteeth,Spacey Jane,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/spacey-jane/sawteeth-chords-2575245,"Wakin' up in a cold sweat
I can tell my socks are wet
It is real it's in my head
I'm not leaving bed just yet
It is Sunday afternoon
It is reckless spring & swoon
I could drink away the moon
Instead I'll open up the wound
And I have any idea what it shouldn't be
People around me they get sawteeth
And I can find the time to drink coffee
I don't remember when but it dawned on me
In the Summer in the slight
In the milky morning light
Hold your hands up to my chest
As the night is fading west
I have lost her (my child)
I have years to feel regret
Overdose on retrospect
She's my freezing, cold night sweat
And I have any idea what it shouldn't be
People around me they get sawteeth
And I can find the time to drink coffee
I don't remember when but it dawned on me
And it could be the shade of leaves on trees
Or it can be the sun, the stars, your knees
& it could be the rice that's too sticky
To me it's just a song to say how much you meant to me
And I have any idea what it shouldn't be
People around me they get sawteeth
And I can find the time to drink coffee
I don't remember when but it dawned on me
And it could be the shade of leaves on trees

Pull me up to ground, mouth to mouth
Oh lover, when you call me out

An old flame who got her hips on a bucket list
And times missed every night since we first kissed

Me in my tie and you all dressed in white
When the band played 'Hey Now'
Our families danced celebrating our vows
Nobody loved you like I did
Thought youâd be mother to my kid
But it all changed when I saw you with someone else
You made all those promises
But you broke them like my heart
Saying things like darling I do
Until death do us apart
Now that times run out on our love
I gotta leave these vows behind
They were empty promises
You would steal me every night
In our city our home as new husband and wife
Drinking in fitzroy pubs till two
Singing those fleetwood songs with you
But it all changed when I saw you with someone else
You made all those promises
But you broke them like my heart
Saying things like darling I do
Until death do us apart
Now that times run out on our love

Don't treat me dumb
Trying to see it both ways
That friend telling you ""better you watch your weight""
But I don't see how you take it

You've fallen for that ""friend"" again

Anyway to sway you in her favour

Before you talked with your friend you never did complain
Now she takes the cake for
Putting words in your mouth
She's never even met me baby
But I forget that when her words are coming out of you
You're saying you need space for no god damn reason
Is this how it ends? Has it come to this?
But I now know how you take it
Just nod and smile
You're still calling her day to day

A far away sound

Marigold in the garden
My heart is out in the garbage
I am being
An alarmist
Cause for as far as I see
It’s terrible territory
And there’s no one
To reassure me
So it would be good to talk
For my sanity
Now do what you feel like you gotta do
But be good to me
When you walk away
You still exist and I feel good knowing it
If it hurts me
Why'd I rely so much on it in the first place?
If it's happening
Then why's this feeling taking over me?
Could I believe
In the me before I knew you beautifully? (x4)

To be free like everyone else

 Rendeztük sok játékcsatát.
 Peti és Én, ha rosszalkodunk,
 Különös dolgokkal foglalkozunk:
 Fegyverek, bombák, pucér nők,
 Egyik sem közelítheti meg Őt.
 Futok és félek, ha odébb állsz, (Ooo)
 Ha nélkülem, egyedül messzire szállsz, (Ooo)

 Peti és Én, ha találkozunk,
 Éjjel és nappal rosszalkodunk,
 Ő nem tudja pontosan mit érzek,
 És bennem is támadnak kétségek.
 Én ránéztem, s Ő rám nézett,
 Aligha meg nem igézett,
 Belélegeztem mint a levegőt,
 Semmi se közelítheti meg Őt.

Lives a life with no regrets
And it makes me wonder
Acts tough but she's struggling
Camouflage but it's wearing thin
I think she's going under
Dancing through the night in electric light
Wishing it could be this way forever
You don't have to hide, I'll be by your side
It's better when we do it together
Most of us are strangers
Who want someone to save us
We're looking out for angels
And something we can hold on
We hear sirens, suffer in the silence
Getting tired of trying
And tired of being alone, ooooh, ooooh
  Reach out when you're feeling low
Tell me everything I need to know
I wanna see you smiling
Come and tell me how it really is
I'm sick of keeping up appearances
Don't tell me you stopped fighting
Dancing through the night in electric light
Wishing it could be this way forever
You don't have to hide, I'll be by your side
Always better when we do it together
Most of us are strangers
Who want someone to save us
We're looking out for angels
And something we can hold on
We hear sirens, suffer in the silence
Getting tired of trying
And tired of being alone, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh

And then I watch you freeze
Thinking they won't care for anything you speak

What love is,... To our devotion
Imperceptibly big, big as the ocean
And equally hard to control
So save your predictions
Love is friction
Endless equations
Doors open up
To interpretation
Expecting perfection
Leaves a lot to ignore
When the past is the present
And the future's no more
When every tomorrow
Is the same as before
The looser things get,... The tighter you become
The looser things get,... Tighter
There's not one man, who's greater than the sum
Falling down,... Not staying down
Could've held me up, rather tear me down
Expecting perfection
Leaves a lot to endure
When the past is the present
And the future's no more
When every tomorrow
Is the same as before
Numbers keep falling off the calendars floor
Stuck in our boxes, Windows open no more
Coullecting up the forget-me-nots
Not recalling what they're for
I'm in love with clairvoyants
'Cause they're out of this world
I know the girls wanna dance,...
Away their circumstance
I know the boys wanna grow,...
Their dix, and fix and fire things
I know the girls wanna dance,...
Clairvoyants in a trance
I know the boys wanna grow,...
Their dix, and fix and fire things
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes
Stand back when the spirit comes

Stand back when the spirit comes

Buried away at the back of my bed
Close my eyes but every time I try to rest
It’s hard to think clearly, you live inside my head
A minute you’re there, a minute you cared, now you’re gone
It’s so unfair, keeping me from moving on
Part of me still wants you, part of me wants to fall asleep
When we're all alone in your bedroom, you came like a reoccurring dream
Part of me still hates you, how could you love someone and leave?
When you’re all alone in your bedroom, do you ever think of me?
The wasted words you’d tried to breathe were poetry
Living in a memory, walking through a daydream
Sister said be patient, things aren’t what they seem
But it’s hard to think clearly, you never say what you mean
A minute you’re there, a minute you cared, now you’re gone
It’s so unfair, keeping me from moving on
Part of me still wants you, part of me wants to fall asleep
When we're all alone in your bedroom, you came like a reoccurring dream
Part of me still hates you, how could you love someone and leave?
When you’re all alone in your bedroom, do you ever think of me?
Think of me, think of me, think of me – me – me – me
Think of me, think of me, think of me – me – me – me
Part of me still wants you, part of me wants to fall asleep
When we're all alone in your bedroom, you came like a reoccurring dream

It seems like you're living in dreams, come back to reality""

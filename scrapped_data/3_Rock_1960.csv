Although I’ll still live on, But so lonely I'll be
The thrill is gone, it's gone away for good
Oh, the thrill is gone, baby it's gone away for good
Someday I know I'll be open armed baby, just like I know a good man should
You know I’m free, free now baby, I’m free from your spell
Oh, I’m free, free, free, now, I’m free from your spell
And now that it’s all over, all I can do is wish you well

 Plowmen dig my earth

 Know what any of it is worth
 No reason to get excited
 The thief he kindly spoke
 There are many here among us
 Who feel that life is but a joke
 But you and I we've been through that
 And this is not our fate
 So let us not talk falsely now
 The hour is getting late
 All along the watchtower
 The princes kept the view
 While all the women came and went,
 Barefoot servants, too.
 Outside in the distance
 A wild cat did growl
 Two riders were approaching
 The wind began to howl

Somewhere a King has no wife

And shine their emptiness    down on my bed
The tiny island   sags downstream
Cause the life that they lived is dead

The names it has blown in the past
And with this crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
It whispers “No, this will be the last”

In the ghetto
And his mama cries
'cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto
People don't you understand
The child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me,
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads and look the other way
Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto
And his hunger burns
so he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal, and he learns how to fight
In the ghetto
Then one night in desperation
A young man breaks away
He buys a gun, steals a car,
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries
As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto
As her young man dies,
On a cold and grey Chicago mornin'
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries...

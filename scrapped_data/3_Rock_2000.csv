0,Hey There Delilah,Plain White T's,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/plain-white-ts/hey-there-delilah-chords-278195,"Hey there Delilah, what’s it like in New York City? 
I’m a thousand miles away, but girl tonight you look so pretty, 
Yes you do, Time Square can’t shine as bright as you, 
I swear it’s true.
Hey there Delilah, don’t you worry about the distance, 
I’m right there if you get lonely, give this song another listen, 
Close your eyes, listen to my voice it’s my disguise, 
I’m by your side.
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
What you do to me.
Hey there Delilah, I know times are getting hard, 
But just believe me girl some day, I'll pay the bills with this guitar, 
We'll have it good, we'll have the life we knew we would, 
My word is good.
Hey there Delilah, I’ve got so much left to say, 
If every simple song I wrote to you, would take your breath away, 
I’d write it all, even more in love with me you’d fall, 
We’d have it all.
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
A thousand miles seems pretty far, but they’ve got planes and trains and cars, 
I’d walk to you if I had no other way 
Our friends would all make fun of us, and we'll just laugh along because, 
We know that none of them have felt this way, 
Delilah I can promise you, that by the time that we get through, 
The world will never ever be the same, and you’re to blame.
Hey there Delilah you be good, and don’t you miss me, 
Two more years and you’ll be done with school, and I'll be making history, 
Like I do, you’ll know it's all because of you, 
We can do whatever we want to, 
Hey there Delilah here's to you, this one’s for you.
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me, 
What you do to me.

It couldn’t be that we have been this way before
I know you don’t think that I am trying
I know you’re wearing thin down to the core
But hold your breath
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
Over again
Don’t make me change my mind
I won’t live to see another day
I swear it’s true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
You’re impossible to find
 This is not what I intended
 I always swore to you that I would never fall apart
 You always thought that I was stronger
 I may have failed
 But I have loved you from the start
Oh, but hold your breath
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
Over again
Don’t make me change my mind
I won’t live to see another day
I swear it’s true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
So breathe in so deep
Breathe me in
I’m yours to keep
And hold onto your words
‘Cause talk is cheap
And remember me tonight
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
Over again
Don’t make me change my mind
Or I won’t live to see another day
I swear it’s true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
Tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
Over again
Don’t make me change my mind
I won’t live to see another day
I swear it’s true
Because a girl like you is impossible to find
You’re impossible to find

Your job's a joke, you're broke, your love life's D.O.A
It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month or even your year
But... I'll be there for you (when the rain starts to pour)
I'll be there for you (like I've been there before)
I'll be there for you ('cause you're there for me too)
You're still at bed at ten, and work began at eight,
You've burned your breakfast so far things are going great
Your mother warned you there'd be days like these
But she didn't tell you when the world has brought you down to your knees
And... I'll be there for you (when the rain starts to pour)
I'll be there for you (like I've been there before)
I'll be there for you ('cause you're there for me too)
No one could ever know me, no one could ever see me
Seems you're the only one who knows what it's like to be me
Some one to face the day with, make it through all the rest with
Someone I'll always laugh with
Even at my worst I'm best with you,     yeah
It's like you're always stuck in second gear
When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month

3,In The End,Linkin Park,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/linkin-park/in-the-end-chords-137484,"It starts with One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
All I know Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
It's so unreal Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on but didn't even know
Wasted it all just to
Watch you go I kept everything inside 
And even though I tried it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually 
Be a memory of a time when
I tried so hard And got so far But in the end It doesn't even matter
I had to fall To lose it all But in the end It doesn't even matter
One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how
I tried so hard In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you've fought with me
I'm surprised it got so (far)
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me
(In the end)
And even though I tried it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually 
Be a memory of a time when 
I tried so hard And got so far But in the end It doesn't even matter
I had to fall To lose it all But in the end It doesn't even matter
I put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go
And for all this There's only one thing you should know
I put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go
And for all this There's only one thing you should know
I tried so hard And got so far But in the end It doesn't even matter

Under everything, just another human being, uh-huh
I don't wanna hurt, there's so much in this world to make me bleed
Stay with me
You're all I see...
Did I say that I need you?
Did I say that I want you?
Oh, if I didn't, I'm a fool you see
No one knows this more than me
As I come clean...
I wonder everyday, as I look upon your face, uh-huh
Everything you gave and nothing you would take, oh no
Nothing you would take,  everything you gave...
Did I say that I need you?
Oh, did I say that I want you?
Oh, if I didn't, I'm a fool you see
No one knows this more than me
And I come clean, ah...
[Outro]
Nothing you would take, everything you gave
Hold me 'till I die
Meet you on the other side...

My father took me into the 
city to see a marching band. 
He said, ""Son when you grow up, 
would you be the saviour of the broken, the beaten and the damned?"" 
He said ""Will you defeat them, 
your demons, and all the non believers, the plans that they have made?"" 
Because one day I'll leave you, 
A phantom to lead you in the
summer, to join the black parade."" 
When I was a young boy, 
My father took me into the 
city to see a marching band. 
He said, ""Son when you grow up, 
would you be the saviour of the broken, the beaten and the damned?"" 
Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me. 
And other times I feel like I should go. 
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets. 
And when you're gone we want you all to know. 
We'll carry on, 
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me 
Your memory will
carry on 
We'll carry on 
And in my heart I can't contain it 
The anthem won't explain it. 
A woman sends you reeling from decimated dreams 
Your misery and hate will kill us all. 
So paint it black and take it back 
Lets shout it loud and clear 
Defiant to the end 
We hear the call 
We'll carry on, 
We'll carry on
And though you're dead and gone believe me 
Your memory will
carry on
We'll carry on
And though you're broken and defeated 
Your weary widow marches 
On and on we carry through the fears 
Disappointed faces of your peers 
Take a look at me cause I could not care at all 
Do or die 
You'll never make me 
Because the world, will never take my heart 
You can try, you'll never break me 
You want it all, you wanna play this part 
I won't explain or
Say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scars 
Give a cheer, for all the broken 
Listen here, because it's who we are 
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero 
I'm just a boy, who's meant to sing this song 
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero 
I -- don't -- care 
We'll carry on 
We'll carry on 
And though you're dead and gone believe me 
Your memory will
Carry on 
You'll carry on 
And though you're broken and defeated 
Your weary widow marches on 
(Do or die You'll never make me 
Because the world, will never take my heart 
You can try, you'll never break me 
You want it all, you wanna play this part)

so take your gloves and get out, better get out
while you can
When you go
would you even turn to say
I don't love you
like I did
yesterday
sometimes I cry so hard from pleading
so sick and tired of all the needless beating
but baby when they knock you down and out
it's where you oughta stay

another dollar's just another blow
so fix your eyes and get up, better get up

The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley

Where you can always find me

We'll wish this never ends

I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stared I counted
Webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
and hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight
Don't waste your time  on   me you're already

Don't waste your time  on   me you're already

And you never left me no messages
You never send me no letters

When out the corner of my eye
I saw a pretty little thing approaching me.
She said ""I've never seen a man
Who looks so all alone,
Could you use a little company?
If you pay the right price
Your evening will be nice,
And you can go and send me on my way.""
I said ""You're such a sweet young thing
Why you do this to yourself?""
She looked at me and this is what she said,
""Oh, there ain't no rest for the wicked,
Money don't grow on trees.
I got bills to pay,
I got mouths to feed,
There ain't nothing in this world for free.
I know I can't slow down,
I can't hold back,
Though you know, I wish I could.
No there ain't no rest for the wicked,
Until we close our eyes for good"".
Not even fifteen minutes later
I'm still walking down the street,
When I saw a shadow of a man creep out of sight.
Then he walks up from behind
And puts a gun up to my head,
He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight.
He said ""Give me all you've got
I want your money not your life,
But if you try to make a move I won't think twice.""
I said ""You can have my cash
But first you know I got to ask
What made you want to live this kind of life?""
He said ""There ain't no rest for the wicked,
Money don't grow on trees.
I got bills to pay,
I got mouths to feed,

I can't hold back,
Though you know, I wish I could.

Until we close our eyes for good"".
Now a couple hours passed
And I was sitting at my house,
The day was winding down and coming to an end.
So I turned on the TV
And flipped it over to the news,
And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend.
I saw a preacher man in cuffs, he'd taken money from the church,
He'd stuffed his bank account with righteous dollar bills.
But even still I can't say much
Because I know we're all the same,
Oh yes we all seek out to satisfy those thrills.

And in the streets you run afree,
Like it's only you and me,
Geeze, you're something to see.
Ahh Home. Let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you.
Ahh Home. Let me come ho-oh-ome.
Home is wherever I'm with you.
La, la, la, la, take me home.
Daddy, I'm coming home.
Ahh Home. Let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you.
Ahh Home. Let me come ho-oh-ome.
Home is wherever I'm with you.
Home. Let me come home.
Home is wherever I'm with you.
Ahh home. Yes I am ho-oh-ome.
Home is when I'm alone with you.
Alabama, Arkansas,
I do love my ma and pa...
Moats and boats and waterfalls,
Alley-ways and pay phone calls...
Home...   Home...
Home is when I'm alone with you.
Home...   Home...

Gotta be green, gotta be mean

Why don't you walk out the door!
How can I help it, how can I help it
How can I help what you think?
Hello my baby, hello my baby
Putting my life on the brink
Why don't you like me, why don't you like me
Why don't you liiike yourself?
Should I bend over? Should I look older
Just to be put on your shelf?

And the days feel like years when I'm alone
And the bed where you lie is made up on your side
When you walk away I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now

When you're gone the face I came to know is missing too
When you're gone the words I need to hear
to always get me through the day and make it okay

Everything that I do, reminds me of you
And the clothes you left that lie on the floor
And they smell just like you, I love the things that you do
When you walk away I count the steps that you take
Do you see how much I need you right now

To make a citizen out of you
Because they sleep with a gun
And keep an eye on you, son
So they can watch all the things you do
Because the drugs never work
Of keeping you clean
They're gonna rip off your heads
Your aspirations to shreds
Another cog in the murder machine
They said, all teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
So darken your clothes
Or strike a violent pose
Maybe they'll leave you alone
But not me
The boys and girls in the clique
You're never gonna fit in much, kid
But if you're troubled and hurt
what you got under your shirt
will make them pay for the things that they did
They said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me
They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
So darken your clothes
Or strike a violent pose

  Just tryin' to keep it in line
  You say you wanna move on and
  You say I'm falling behind
Can you read my mind?
Can you read my mind?
  I never really gave up on
  Breakin' out of this two-star town
  I got the green light, I got a little fight
  I'm gonna turn this thing around
Can you read my mind?
Can you read my mind?
The good old days, the honest man
The restless heart, the promised land
A subtle kiss that no one sees
A broken wrist and a big trapeze
Oh well I don't mind, if you don't mind
Coz I don't shine if you don't shine
Before you go, can you read my mind?
  It’s funny how you just break down
  Waitin' on some sign
  I pull up to the front of your driveway
  With magic soakin' my spine
Can you read my mind?
Can you read my mind?
The teenage queen, the loaded gun
The drop dead dream, the chosen one
A southern drawl, a world unseen
A city wall and a trampoline
Oh well I don't mind, if you don't mind
Cause I don't shine if you don't shine
Before you jump,    tell me what you 
find    when you read my mind
   Slippin’ in my faith until I fall
He never returned that call
   Woman, open the door, don't let it sting
I wanna breathe that fire again,   she said
I don't mind, if you don't mind
Cause I don't shine if you don't shine
Put your back on me
Put your back on me
Put your back on me
  The stars are blazing like rebel diamonds cut out of the sun
When you read my mind

Change the weather still together when it ends

I'm afraid if I go out
I'll outwear my welcome.

I don't have any big, lasting plans.

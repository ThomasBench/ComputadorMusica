0,Dear Agony (ver 5),Breaking Benjamin,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/breaking-benjamin/dear-agony-chords-1135207,"  I have nothing left to give
I have found the perfect end
You were made to make it hurt
Disappear into the dirt
Carry me to heaven's arms
Light the way and let me go
Take the time to take my breath
I will end where I began
    And I will find the enemy within
Because I can feel it crawl beneath my skin
Dear Agony
Just let go of me
Suffer slowly
Is this the way it's got to be?
Dear Agony
  Suddenly
The lights go out
Let forever drag me down
I will fight for one last breath
I will fight until the end
    And I will find the enemy within
Because I can feel it crawl beneath my skin
Dear Agony
Just let go of me
Suffer slowly
Is this the way it's got to be?
Don't bury me
Faceless enemy
I'm so sorry
Is this the way it's gotta be?
Dear Agony
  Leave me alone
God let me go
I'm blue and cold
Black sky will burn
Love pull me down
Hate lift me up
Just turn around
There's nothing left
Somewhere far beyond this world
I feel nothing anymore
Dear Agony
Just let go of me
Suffer slowly
Is this the way it's got to be?
Don't bury me
Faceless enemy
I'm so sorry
Is this the way it's gotta be?
Dear Agony
     I feel nothing anymore

Damit die sieht, wie hoch das Kind schon schaukeln kann
Und es wirft die Beine vor und hoch zum Himmel
Bis ein Schuh davonfliegt und der landet dann
Auf einem Auto, das am Straßenrand geparkt ist
Auf dessen Windschutzscheibe ""Schwein"" geschrieben steht
Und das, metallic-braun und glatt wie deine Haare,
Genau wie du sein wahres Alter nicht verrät
Ganz egal, woran ich gerade denke
Am Ende denk ich immer nur an dich
Die deutsche Mutter stürzt nach vorn in frischer Panik
Und übersieht dabei ein Kindesbein im Sand
Und schlägt lang hin, da lacht der Kindesbeinbesitzer
Der hat ein Erdbeereis in seiner rechten Hand
Das hängt bedenklich schräg nach vorn in seiner Waffel
Und tropft sich selbst verschwendend auf die Haute Couture
Am Leib des ganzen Stolzes seiner schönen Eltern
Und wird zu Dreck dort, genau wie ich bei dir
Ganz egal, woran ich gerade denke
Am Ende denk ich immer nur an dich
Warum blutet Mutter aus der Nase?
Warum ist ihr Kind so dumm wie klein?
Darf ein Metallic-braunes Auto denn da parken?
Und warum kann ich ohne dich nicht glücklich sein?
Wie viele Erdbeereise muss der Mensch noch essen
Bevor er endlich einmal sagt: Ich bin dafür
Die böse Tat des Beinestellens zu unterlassen
Und darf ich irgendwann nochmal zurück zu dir
Ganz egal, woran ich gerade denke
Am Ende denk ich immer nur an dich
Ganz egal, woran ich gerade denke
Am Ende denk ich immer nur an dich

vendra un nuevo amanecer

 Tal vez colmaban la necesidad,
 pero hay vacios que no pueden llenar.
 No conocian la profundidad,
 hasta que un dia no dio para mas.
 Quedabas esperando ecos que no volveran.
 Flotando entre rechazos,
 del mismo dolor
vendra un nuevo amanecer

 por algo superior no es soberbia, es amor
 no es soberbia, es amor

Drain all the blood and give the kids a show.

A seance down below.
There're things that I have done,
And without you is how I disappear,
And live my life alone forever now.
And without you is how I disappear,
And live my life alone forever now.
Who walks among the famous living dead,
Drowns all the boys and girls inside your bed.
And if you could talk to me,
Tell me if it's so,
That all the good girls go to heaven.
That without you is how I disappear,
And live my life alone forever now.
And without you is how I disappear,
And live my life alone forever now.
Can you hear me cry out to you?
Words I thought I'd choke on figure out.
I'm really not so with you anymore.
I'm just a ghost,
So I can't hurt you anymore,
So I can't hurt you anymore.
So, you can, well now so, you can
I'm so far away from you.
Well now so, you can.

Czarny chleb i czarna kawa, opętani samotnością
Myślą swą szukają szczęścia, które zwie się wolnością

Brat Twój w ciemnej celi siedzi, odsiaduje wyrok swój
Czarny chleb i czarna kawa, opętani samotnością
Myślą swą szukają szczęścia, które zwie się wolnością

I nadejdzie chwila błoga, śmierć zabierze oddech mój

Of the road, turn out the lights, get out and look up at the sky
And I do this to remind me that I'm really, really tiny
In the grand scheme of things and sometimes this terrifies me
But it's only really scary cause it makes me feel serene
In a way I never thought I'd be because I've never been
So grounded, and so humbled, and so one with everything
I am grounded, I am humbled, I am one with everything
Rock and roll is fun but if you ever hear someone
Say you are huge, look at the moon, look at the stars, look at the sun
Look at the ocean and the desert and the mountains and the sky
Say I am just a speck of dust inside a giant's eye
I am just a speck of dust inside a giant's eye
When I saw Geneviève I really liked it when she said
What she said about the giant and the lemmings on the cliff
She said 'I like giants
Especially girl giants
Cause all girls feel too big sometimes
Regardless of their size'
When I go for a drive I like to pull off to the side
Of the road and run and jump into the ocean in my clothes
And I'm smaller than a poppyseed inside a great big bowl
And the ocean is a giant that can swallow me whole
So I swim for all salvation and I swim to save my soul
But my soul is just a whisper trapped inside a tornado
So I flip to my back and I float and I sing
I am grounded, I am humbled, I am one with everything
I am grounded, I am humbled, I am one with everything
So I talked to Geneviève and almost cried when she said
That the giant on the cliff wished that she was dead
And the lemmings on the cliff wished that they were dead
So the giant told the lemmings why they ought to live instead
When she thought up all those reasons that they ought to live instead
It made her reconsider all the sad thoughts in her head
So thank you Geneviève, cause you take what is in your head
And you make things that are so beautiful and share them with your friends
We all become important when we realize our goal
Should be to figure out our role within the context of the whole
And yeah, rock and roll is fun, but if you ever hear someone
Say you are huge, look at the moon, look at the stars, look at the sun
Look at the ocean and the desert and the mountains and the sky
Say I am just a speck of dust inside a giant's eye
I am just a speck of dust inside a giant's eye
I am just a speck of dust inside a giant's eye

I said that I'm just fine
I remember, head down, after you had found out
And I need a little more, I think
Because enough is never quite enough
What's enough?
I took it like a grown man crying on the pavement
But I haven't heard a thing you've said
In at least a couple hundred days
What'd you say?
I was in the front seat, shaking it out
I never want to hear the truth
I want to hear your voice, it sounded fine
My voice is sounding fine
I could feel my heartbeat taking me down
Veiny with a selfish fear
To keep me up another restless night
Another restless night
Your blood was dry, it was sober, and the feeling
audible cracks....
And I could tell it was over from the curtains 
that hung from your neck
And I realized that then you were perfect
With my teeth ripping out of my head
And it looked like a painting I once knew
Back when my thoughts weren't entirely intact
So I prayed for what I thought were angels
Ended up being ambulances
And the Lord showed me dreams of my daughter
She was crying inside your stomach
       ...and I felt love... again.

But why should I lie? Everything reminds me of her

Of the sun on the steeple
And I gotta hear the same sermon
All the time now from you people:
'Why are you staring into outer space, crying?
Just because you came across it, and lost it...'

Forever waiting on that line
If nothing ever moves
Put that needle to the groove
And sing
Is it a dream keeping you awake?
Is it the stillness that makes you shake?

What's on the ocean's floor
You'll sink
Do you like things the way they seem?
Or are you looking behind the scenes?

What it takes to make it so
Just believe
Are there dark parts to your mind?
Hidden secrets left behind?
Where no one ever goes

It's all right

It must be something going 'round

Will blow us all

Such a long time running, And I cant stop now. 
Do you hear my heart beating? Can you hear the sound? 
'Cos I cant help thinking, And I dont look down. 
And then i looked up at the sun and I could see 
Oh the way that gravity turns for you and me. 
And then I looked up at the sky and saw the sun 
And the way that gravity pulls on everyone...on everyone. 
Baby its been a long time waiting, Such a long, long time, 
And i cant stop smiling, No I cant stop now 
Do you hear my heart beating? Can you hear the sound? 
'Cos I cant help crying, And I wont look down.

49,The Predatory Wasp Of The Palisades Is Out To Get Us,Sufjan Stevens,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/sufjan-stevens/the-predatory-wasp-of-the-palisades-is-out-to-get-us-chords-953696,"Thinking outrageously I write in cursive
I hide in my bed with the lights on the floor
Wearing three layers of coats and leg warmers
I see my own breath on the face of the door
Oh I am not quite sleeping
Oh I am fast in bed
There on the wall in the bedroom creeping
I see a wasp with her wings outstretched
North of Savanna we swim in the palisades
I come out wearing my brother's red hat
There on his shoulder my best friend is bit seven times
He runs washing his face in his hands
Oh how I meant to tease him
Oh how I meant no harm
Touching his back with my hand I kiss him
I see the wasp on the length of my arm
Oh great sights upon this state! Hallelujah!
Wonders bright, and rivers, lake. Hallelujah!
Trail of Tears and Horseshoe Lake. Hallelujah!
trusting things beyond mistake. Hallelujah!
We were in love. We were in love.
Palisades! Palisades!
I can wait. I can wait.
Lamb of God, we sound the horn. Hallelujah!
To us your ghost is born. Hallelujah!
I can't explain the state that I'm in
The state of my heart, he was my best friend
Into the car, from the back seat
Oh admiration in falling asleep
All of my powers, day after day
I can tell you, we swaggered and swayed
Deep in the tower, the prairies below
I can tell you, the telling gets old
Terrible sting and terrible storm
I can tell you the day we were born
My friend is gone, he ran away
I can tell you, I love him each day
Though we have sparred, wrestled and raged
I can tell you I love him each day
Terrible sting, terrible storm
I can tell you...

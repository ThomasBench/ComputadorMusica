0,Your Song (ver 2),Elton John,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/elton-john/your-song-chords-94212," It's a little bit funny...  this feeling inside
 I'm not one of those who can, easily hide
 I don't have much money, but boy if I did
 I'd buy a big house where, we both could live
 If I was a sculptor... but then again no
 or a man who make potions in a travelling show
 Well, I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
 My gift is my song and this one's for you
 And you can tell everybody, this is your song
 It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
 I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
 that I put down in words
How wonderful life is, when you're in the world
 I sat on the roof...   and kicked off the moss
 Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross
 But the sun's been quite kind, while I wrote this song
 It's for people like you that, keep it turned on
 So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
 you see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
 Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
 Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
 And you can tell everybody, this is your song
 It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
 I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
 that I put down in words
How wonderful life is, when you're in the world
 I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
 that I put down in words
How wonderful life is, when you're in the world

1,Whiskey In The Jar (ver 2),Thin Lizzy,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/thin-lizzy/whiskey-in-the-jar-chords-811918,"As I was goin' over, the Cork and Kerry mountains
I saw Captain Farrell and his money he was countin
I first produced my pistol and then produced my rapier
I said stand and deliver or the devil he may take ya
Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
I took all of his money and it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money and I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she'd love me, never would she leave me
But the devil take that woman for you know she tricked me easy
Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
 Whack for my daddy-o
 Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Being drunk and weary I went to Molly's chamber
Takin my money with me and I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven in walked Captain Farrell
I jumped up, fired off my pistols and I shot him with both barrels
Musha ring dum a doo dum a da
 Whack for my daddy-o
 Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Now some men like the fishin' and some men like the fowlin'
And some men like to hear   the cannon ball a roarin'
Me I like sleepin' specially in my Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison, here I am with a ball and chain, yeah

And get out when they blow.

Ramble on Rose.

One heat up, and one cool down,
Leave nothin' for the tailor.

One go up, and one go down,
Do yourself a favor.

10,Quand Tes Dans Le Désert,Jean-Patrick Capdevielle,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/1829066,"     Moi je traîne dans le désert depuis plus de vingt-huit jours
     Et déjà quelques mirages me disent de faire demi-tour
     La fée des neiges me suit, tapant sur son tambour
     Les fantômes du syndicat des marchands de certitude
     Se sont glissés jusqu'à ma dune, reprochant mon attitude
     C'est pas très populaire le goût d'la solitude
     Quand t'es dans le désert
     Depuis trop longtemps
     Tu t' demandes à qui ça sert
     Toutes les règles un peu truquées
     Du jeu qu'on veut t' faire jouer
     Les yeux bandés
     Tous les rapaces du pouvoir menés par un gros clown sinistre
     Plongent vers moi sur la musique d'un piètre accordéoniste
     J' crois pas qu'ils viennent me parler des joies d' la vie d'artiste
     D' l'autre côté voilà Caïn toujours aussi lunatique
     Son œil est empli de sable et sa bouche pleine de verdicts
     Il trône dans un cimetière de vieilles pelles mécaniques
     Quand t'es dans le désert
     Depuis trop longtemps
     Tu t' demandes à qui ça sert
     Toutes les règles un peu truquées
     Du jeu qu'on veut t' faire jouer
     Les yeux bandés
     Les gens disent que les poètes finissent tous trafiquants d'armes
     On est cinquante millions d'poètes, c'est ça qui doit faire notre charme
     Sur une lune de Saturne mon perroquet sonne l'alarme
     Vendredi tombant d'nulle part y'a Robinson l'solitaire
     Qui m'a dit: « J' trouve plus mon île, vous n'auriez pas vu la mer? »
     Va falloir que j'lui parle du thermonucléaire.
     Quand t'es dans le désert
     Depuis trop longtemps
     Tu t' demandes à qui ça sert
     Toutes les règles un peu truquées
     Du jeu qu'on veut t' faire jouer
     Les yeux bandés
     Quand t'es dans le désert
     Depuis trop longtemps, la la la...
     Tu t' demandes à qui ça sert...
     Les yeux bandés
     Hier un homme est v'nu vers moi d'une démarche un peu traînante
     Il m'a dit: ""T'as t'nu combien d' jours ? "" J'ai répondu: ""Bientôt trente""
     J'me souviens qu'il espérait tenir jusqu'à quarante
     Quand j'ai d'mandé son message, il m'a dit d'un air tranquille
     Les politiciens finiront tous un jour au fond d'un asile

And I'll try, oh Lord, I'll try,

reflections in the waves spark my memory

We lived happily forever, so the story goes
But somehow we missed out, on the pot of gold
But we'll try, best that we can,

And hard like an oak
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear
If you want me, honey baby I'll be here
I like your smile
And your fingertips
I like the way that you move your hips
I like the cool way you look at me
Everything about you is bringing me misery
Little red wagon
Little red bike
I ain't no monkey but I know what I like
I like the way you love me strong and slow
I'm takin' you with me, honey baby when I go

You do what you must do and ya do it well

   Searching for soda bottles to get myself some dough
   Brought 'em down to the corner, down to the country store
   Cash 'em in and give my money to a man named Curtis Loew
Old Curt was a black man with white curly hair
When he had a fifth of wine he did not have a care
He used to own an old dobro, used to play it across his knee
I'd give old Curt my money, he'd play all day for me
Play me a song Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew
Well, I got your drinking money, tune up your dobro
People said he was useless, them people are the fools
cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker to ever play the blues
He looked to be sixty, and maybe I was ten
Mama used to whip me but I'd go see him again
I'd clap my hands, stomp my feets, try to stay in time
He'd play me a song or two
Then take another drink of wine.
Play me a song Curtis Loew, Curtis Loew
Well, I got your drinking money, tune up your dobro
People said he was useless, them people are the fools
cause Curtis Loew was the finest picker to ever play the blues
On the day old Curtis died, nobody came to pray
Ol' preacher said some words, and they chunked him in the clay
Well he lived a lifetime playin' the black man's blues
And on the day he lost his life, that's all he had to lose
Play me a song Curtis Loew, hey Curtis Loew
I wish that you was here so everyone would know
People said he was useless, them people all are fools
cause Curtis you're the finest picker to ever play the blues

He gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke or to light up your smoke
But there's someplace that he'd rather be

As the smile ran away from his face
""well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
If I could get out of this place""

44,The Logical Song (ver 2),Supertramp,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/supertramp/the-logical-song-chords-91439,"When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful,
A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical.
And all the birds in the trees, well they'd be singing so happily,
Joyfully, playfully watching me.
But then they send me away to teach me how to be sensible,
Logical, responsible, practical.
And they showed me a world where I could be so dependable,
Clinical, intellectual, cynical.
There are times when all the world's asleep,
The questions run too deep
For such a simple man.
Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned
I know it sounds absurd
But please tell me who I am.
Now watch what you say or they'll be calling you a radical,
Liberal, fanatical, criminal.
Won't you sign up your name, we'd like to feel you're acceptable
Respectable, presentable, a vegetable!
At night, when all the world's asleep,
The questions run so deep
For such a simple man.
Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned
I know it sounds absurd
But please tell me who I am.
Who I am.
Who I am.
Who I am.

You take up the yoke and plow the fields around.
Gone are the days when the ladies said, ""Please,
Gentle Jack Jones won't you come to me.

The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean.
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down,
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on.
1920 when he stepped to the bar,
Drank to the dregs of the whiskey jar.
1930 when the wall caved in,
He paid his way selling red-eyed gin.

The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean.
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down,
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on.
Delilah Jones was the mother of twins,
Two times over and the rest were sins.
Raised eight boys, only I turned bad,
Didn't get the lickin's that the other ones had.
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine,
The bottle was dusty but the liquor was clean.
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down,
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on.
Tumble down shack in Big Foot county.
Snowed so hard that the roof caved in.
Delilah Jones went to meet her God,
And the old man never was the same again.
Daddy made whiskey and he made it well.
Cost two dollars and it burned like hell.
I cut hick'ry just to fire the still,
Drink down a bottle and be ready to kill.

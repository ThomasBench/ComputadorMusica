Signed with a home tattoo happy birthday to you was created for ya
Can't ever keep from falling apart  at the seams
Can't I believe you're taking my heart    too pieces
Oh, it'll take a little time might take a little crime to come undone now
We'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside
Hey child  stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry
Who do you need? Who do you love?  When you come undone
Who do you need? Who do you love?  When you come undone
Words play me deja-vu like a radio tune I swear I've heard before
Chills is it something real or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers
Can't ever keep from falling apart  at the seams
Can't I believe you're taking my heart    too pieces
Lost in a snow filled sky we'll make it alright to come undone now
We'll try to stay blind to the hope and fear outside
Hey child stay wilder than the wind and blow me in to cry
Who do you need? Who do you love?  When you come undone
Who do you need? Who do you love?  When you come undone

You know I'm gonna be like you""

Little boy blue and a man on the moon

Could you teach me to throw?"", I said ""Not today
I got a lot to do"", he said ""That's OK""

See you later, can I have them please

I called him up just the other day
I'd like to see you, if you don't mind

You see, my new job a hassle and the kids have the flu,
But it's sure nice talking to you dad, 
It's been sure nice talkin' to you
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me!

and I don't wanna close the door 
And if you're somewhere out there 
Passed out on the floor
Oh..Joey I'm not angry anymore
And if I seem to be confused, 
I didn't mean to be with you. 
And when you said I scared you 
Well I guess you scared me too
But if it's love you're lookin for
Then I can give a little more 
And if you're somewhere drunk
And passed out on the floor 
Oh Joey I'm not angry anymore
Angry any - more...

  it was a Friday night
  I wore cologne
  to get the feeling right
  We started making out
  and she took off my pants
  But then I turned on the TV
And that's about the
time she walked away from
me     Nobody likes you
when you're twenty-three
  And are still more
amused by TV shows
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I
should act my age
  What's my age again?
  What's my age again?
  Then later on
  on the drive home
  I called her mom
  from a pay phone
  I said I was the cops
  And your husband's in jail
 This state looks
down on sodomy
And that's about the time
that bitch hung up on me
  Nobody likes you when
you're twenty-three
  And are still more amused
by prank phone calls
What the hell is caller ID?
My friends say I should act
my age What's my age again?
  What's my age again?
And that's about the time
she walked away from me
  Nobody likes you when
you're twenty-three
  And you still act like
you're in Freshman
year What the hell
is wrong with me?
My friends say I
should act my age
  What's my age again?
And that's about the
time she broke up with
me    No one should take
themselves so seriously
  With many years
ahead to fall in
line Why would you
wish that on me?
I never want to act my
age What's my age again?
  What's my age again?

To familiar heroes from long ago

Could be financial suicide but I've got too much pride inside to
hide or slide  I'll do as I decide and let it ride until I've died, And only then shall I abide
this tide of catchy little tunes
Or hip three minute ditties

I wanna burn all of your cities

I will not mess around
Unless I play then hey
I will go on all day  hear what I
say I have a prayer to pray

Just to hold the spot
Of every suicide hotline volunteer you ever called
I'm not your mom
And I'm not your therapist
And I'm not safe enough to take this risk
I don't wanna eat your dread
The very same way
That women swallow cum just to make it go away
And you should treat me better
Than the goddamn fruit
You cut a hole in back in seventh grade
And I know
I know you're sad
Let me just remind you
I am not your fuckin' dad
I don't wanna suck you off
Just to hold the spot
Of every mental health professional you ever saw
I'm not your therapist
I'm not trained for this
And I don't wanna be forced to listen
Under coercion
Under the threat of your blood on my hands
Let me remind you
That I am not your dad
I am not your daddy
I can't support you
I can't work through all your childhood trauma for you
I don't wanna fuck you
Like he never could
I don't wanna be the thing you fuck to do something you shouldn't
I don't owe you any space on my bed
This isn't feminism
It's straight up normal fucking etiquette
When I say fuck off
Fuck off
Because consent's about more than just
Your cock and the government, so
I don't wanna suck you off
Just to hold the spot
Of every mental health professional you never saw
I'm not your therapist
I'm not trained for this
And I don't wanna be forced to listen
Under coercion
Under the threat of your blood on my hands
Leveraging my constant guilt against me
And you force me into submission
And I would be so much less offended
If you just told me to get back into the kitchen
I don't even feel good about it anymore
'Cause you don't take the advice you fuckin' use me for
I don't wanna suck you off
Just to hold the spot
Of every mental health professional you ever saw
I'm not your therapist
I'm not trained for this
And I don't wanna take a fucking risk
Under coercion
Under the threat of your blood on my hands
Let me remind you
That I am not your dad
Let me remind you
To call your fucking dad

They could prescribe you any illness you like, if you define the terms of your ailment
You could sing a pretty malady like a black canary,  but a crow don't know the smell of carbon monoxide
How many years have you been on that couch? They coulda quilt'd you in the throws by now
You draw a line in the sand, where it ends and you begin, but the tide rolls in, so who knows? Oh, well.
And a little identity never hurt nobody,
oh but lately you've been focusing too much on yourself
So how many milligrams of you are still left in there?
‘Cause back in my day we didn't need no feel-good pills, and no psychiatrists
No we just drank ourselves to death, and goddammit we liked it
Who makes the call, what's a symptom, what’s a flaw? Could it be both?
Well I suppose that’s some kind of answer
Would you give up your humanity for just a touch of sanity? ‘Cause god knows, it’s not like its cancer!
And good news to the purist, they discovered a cure for the symptoms of being alive
It’s a painless procedure with a low rate of failure, but very few patients survive!
And a little conformity never hurt nobody, but lately I've been worried that you're losing yourself
So how many milligrams of you are still left in there?
‘Cause back in my day we didn't need no feel-good pills, and no psychiatrists
No we just bled out in our baths, and goddammit we liked it
Doctor, what's my prognosis if the studies show that
Disease is in the eye of the beholder
Tell me so it goes
We depress to impress, I guess, in layer after layer to get off our chests
It’s cold out now, we can take it off later
Better safe than sorry and we both know the dangers
So doctor, could you run another test?
Got a feeling this time I might just pass it, well if you raise the average!
We all sing when the bell curve rings, in lyrics symptomatic of the way we think
If our harmonies don't sync, we can change our voices, our chorus unconditional of diagnosis
Back in my day we didn't need no feel good pills, and no psychiatrists
What can I say except don't heed no evil wills of moral nihilists
I said back in the days of lobotomies, shock therapies, and mad scientists!
Oh don't you make me waste my breath, and goddammit—
Is your identity at stake? Does aspirin kill you with the pain?
You're not your thoughts, you're not your brain, you're just that character you've made
Up in your head, down in your heart, what seem like separate body parts
Just come together to believe they're you, and not just chemistry
It’s not the way you were raised, not what the advertisements say
Not what you pay for, what you pray for, what you want or what you say
And I see your tendency to redefine disease by what you need,
and I'm afraid I can't prescribe the diagnosis that you seek
But something tells me that you need, forgive me now if I misspeak,
but something tells me that you like, yeah something tells me—
That you prefer
Well that's our time, see you same time next week

We feed the homeless on some weekends, we pick up trash in all the parks
And even though we're cleaning up the whole damn neighborhood
It didn't fix me like I thought it would
I got that book you recommended about the spy in East Berlin
I really like the way it ended, how he forgave his friend and turns him in

It didn't fix me like I thought it would

But I say that out of obligation, I really spent hours on my speech
I thanked my biggest inspirations and the good folks back in Hollywood

Vendí mi piano, compré un buen traje

podría decirse que todo va bien

W dziurawą ścianę wbiję wzrok
Do sieci wrzucę płaczliwy post
Polubisz go
Ty tylko popatrzysz, a ja
Poczuję się gorzej na samą myśl
Zaczynam zamykanie bram
Nie patrzę w tył
Wcisnę się, choć chyba mam dość
Wśród ludzi łatwiej tłumić gniew
Nie chcę myśleć o Tobie wciąż
Do domu chcę
Słyszałem, że dobrze go znam

Lecę w dół przez błędy wszystkich lat
Widzę wyraźnie pełne rozczarowań twarze
A w oczach ból i gniew uśpionych zdarzeń
Kłamałem więcej niż kiedykolwiek chciałbym przyznać
A w moich żyłach płynęła krew zimniejsza niż stal
Dlatego dzisiaj jestem całkiem sam
Mój nieznajomy, czy widzisz to co ja?

That's when her demons come say ""Hey""
Dusk is always harder for my baby
So I told her not to be afraid
That I'd think of her at that time of day
So I think about when her eyes light up
I think about when her eyes light up
The world, the whole wide world
But the world don't matter
When we're looking at each other
Oh, she's got this way of making you feel like
You've lived a thousand times and nеver gonna die
And she shinеs illuminated by the strobe light
She smiles and everything will be alright
In the world, the whole wide world
But the world don't matter
When we're looking at each other

Święty był spokój, już opadły fale
Miało nic się nie zdarzyć, a w radio mówią
Że idzie nagły front
Znaki na niebie zwiastują kłopoty
Doszły na świecie do głosu złe głosu
Idzie trzęsienie ziemi i wielka woda
A ja się czuję dziwnie lekko na wznak
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Uwierzę, że to sen
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Ale jeszcze nie budź mnie
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Drzewa zimowe jak otwarte dłonie
Spijam Twój oddech, spijam sen spod powiek
Zanim ze mną utoniesz
Chciałbym móc powiedzieć Ci o czym dobrze wiesz
Więc możemy o tym milczeć
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Wszystko będzie dobrze

To był tylko dobry sen

Moment nigdy nie ten
Na piękną katastrofę
To był tylko dobry sen

Jaki piękny widok
Gdy wszystko płonie
To był tylko dobry sen
Na zderzenie planet
Moment nigdy nie ten
Na świata koniec
A co jeżeli się obudzę sam?

When all I want to do is fall

 Lookin' at pictures on my phone

I'll never have the wherewithal to do it all again
   Or fucking do it all at all
I love you so much, I don't wanna go but
Everybody knows this place is dying, as am I
I might not get another chance
It's such a careful dance and I am such a fuck up
If you only knew that I am such a fuck up
I've got one hundred hours to rearrange the stars
And I'm the worst mistake that God has ever made
You seem to integrate so fucking well
But I make lemons out of lemonade
   Blood clots and death cramps, injections and leakages
The election cyclе and the tides
Aztec circlеs of the death of all deaths
But the beast refuses to die
In your guts you know it's all destroyed
You could've had a boy if you had children
Now you think you might just put them down
None of us belong, everything I do is wrong
And soon there will be nobody left around
And in your blood, you know what's right
And in your bones, you know what's wrong
And in your throat, you know you're lying to kids
And you know nobody belongs    in this hell
And there is not a single choice left to make
I am God's worst mistake and
You seem happy on the knife's edge
But I just lick the blade
I've got one hundred hours to rearrange the stars
And I'm the worst mistake that God has ever made
You seem to integrate so fucking well
But I make lemons out of lemonade
   Blood clots, death camps, glitz and depressions
The election cycle and the tides
Concentric circles of torture wheels
But the beast refuses to die
Atomistic rational behavior, invisible hand savior
Fucking up your definitions even though it's life or death
Who fuckin' told you you were selfish or even self-interested?
Don't you think it matters when we wish our friends the best
And, fuck, I'm not a Marxist, I'm not a fuckin' democrat
Because of all this bullshit, I'm not anything at all
All I wanted was a framework, none of them can live here
There's nothing to believe in and there won't be till we fall
And it's not all you, man, you were just a kid once

And I'm the worst mistake your God has ever made
I can't get the numbers right, I can't fucking count

 Bist du auch so gelangweilt,
Genervt und gestresst von der Enge der Stadt.
Bist du nicht auch längst schon müde
der Straßen, der Menschen, der Massen
Hast du das nicht satt?
Ich kann nicht mehr atmen,
Seh kaum noch den Himmel
Die Hochhäuser haben meine Seele verbaut
Bin immer erreichbar und erreiche doch gar nichts
Ich halte es hier nicht mehr aus
Lass uns hier raus
Hinter Hamburg, Berlin oder Köln
Hört der Regen auf Straßen zu füllen
Hör'n wir endlich mal wieder
Das Meer und die Wellen
Lass und gehen, lass uns gehen, lass uns gehen
Hinter Hamburg, Berlin oder Köln
Hör'n die Menschen auf Fragen zu stellen
Hör'n wir endlich mal wieder
Das Meer und die Wellen
Lass uns gehen, lass uns gehen, lass uns gehen
Die Stadt frisst die Ruhe
Mit flackernden Lichtern
Schluckt Tage und Nächte in sich hinein
Gehetzte Gesichter in der drängelnden Masse
Jeder muss überall schnell sein
Zwischen den Zeilen hab ich gelesen
Dass wir beide weg von hier wollen
Wir stecken hier fest
Verschüttet im Regen
und träumen vom Sommer in Schweden. 
Lass uns hier raus
Hinter Hamburg, Berlin oder Köln
Hört der Regen auf Straßen zu füllen
Hör'n wir endlich mal wieder
Das Meer und die Wellen
Lass und gehen, lass uns gehen, lass uns gehen
Hinter Hamburg, Berlin oder Köln
Hör'n die Menschen auf Fragen zu stellen
Hör'n wir endlich mal wieder
Das Meer und die Wellen
Lass uns gehen, lass uns gehen, lass uns gehen         
      Lass uns geh´n, lass uns gehen, lass uns gehen......   (2x)

Hört der Regen auf Straßen zu füllen

Das Meer und die Wellen

Hör'n die Menschen auf Fragen zu stellen
Hör'n wir endlich mal wieder

For every hard earned dollar I make
there stands a white man just to take it away.

I've busted bones, broken stones, looked the devil in the eye
I hope he's going to break these chains.
The Devil's going to make me a free man
the Devil's going to set me free
The Devil's going to make me a free man
the Devil's going to set me free
Another hard day, no water no rest.
I saw my chance so I got him at last.
I took his six shooter, put two in his chest
He'll never say a word no more, he'll never say a word no more.
The devil got him good for sure.
Ain't got no place to call a home,
only chains and broken bones.
Ain't got no place to call a home

Cheer up my brothers, live in the sunshine
Well understand this, all by and by
Tempted and tried, I wondered why
The good man died, the bad man thrives
And Jesus cries because he loves em both
Hangin on by the last threads of our hope
In a house of mirrors full of smoke
Confusing illusions Ive seen
Where did I go wrong, I sang along
To every chorus of the song
That the devil wrote like a piper at the gates
Leading mice and men down to their fates
But some will courageously escape
The seductive voice with a heart of faith
While walkin that line back home
So much more to life than weve been told
Its full of beauty that will unfold
And shine like you struck gold my wayward son
That deadweight burden weighs a ton
Go down into the river and let it run
And wash away all the things youve done
Forgiveness alright
Farther along well know all about it
Farther along well understand why
Cheer up my brothers, live in the sunshine
Well understand this, all by and by
Still I get hard pressed on every side
Between the rock and a compromise
Like the truth and pack of lies fightin for my soul
And Ive got no place left to go
Cause I got changed by what Ive been shown
More glory than the world has known
Keeps me ramblin on
Skipping like a calf loosed from its stall
Im free to love once and for all
And even when I fall Ill get back up
For the joy that overflows my cup
Heaven filled me with more than enough
Broke down my levees and my bluff
Let the flood wash me
And one day when the sky rolls back on us
Some rejoice and the others fuss
Cause every knee must bow and tongue confess
His is the kingdom, were the guests
So put your voice up to the test
Sing Lord, come soon

But each white, silvery flicker's, a faithful reminder to us
Of a weight that's in youth, that makes a dick of us all
If it happened today, then it's probably happened before
In a crowd unfamiliar, I just wanna touch a familiar face
And make friends at the parties I've feared, the likes of an age
To be wanted with truth, and make formidable love
See light in myself, that I see inside everyone else I know
It's not a lacking of spine, nor of physical pulse
It's just a feeling of distance, akin to a feeling of loss
Of love in the youth, of my limited life
That passed in a violent, and ritual screwing inside
the years unfamiliar, are made of increasingly digital days
And I am grieving the loss of myself, with frightening malaise
When there's weightness in youth, and the sum of it's small
Just stand in the darkness, and laugh with your heel on its throat
      'Coz not everything means something honey
So say the unsayable, say the most human of things
And if everything is temporary, I
Will bear the unbearable, terrible triteness of being
Alone in my house
Frozen in time
But don't get me wrong now honey
I'm trying
There's a warmth in the eyes and a clearness of thought
When the deepest of sighs and the frankest of shadows are gone
We're pushing a stone, up a mountainous waste
And the lines at the store look like lines on a beautiful face
See, I'm not so assured, nor unusually strong or outstandingly brave
I'm more just fumbling around in the dark, for the bulk of my day
When there's weight that's in youth and the sum of it's small

You want someone to want you for who you are, I want someone to try and let me down

Sometimes life sucks, everything is lame, Not everything’s as easy as making lemonade
And so dismembering our state of balance, with lust requited, a gaze undivided
With a cool mind, warmth in your face, a good heart, grace under pressure
Give me a good reason to be heartsick again, to be here, to be strong, to be oddly and boldly estranged

I always, I always say 'Just put on some Whitesnake'
But hey, I’m still young, it’s gonna be okay, I got solipsism, baby, and I brought lemonade
I’ll surrender then, all my balance, and be excited and drink to tonight
It’s not a bad time, time spent with you, there’s cool lights, there's songs with good lyrics
We never have to talk again, whatever, up to you, but since you’re putting up with me
Here’s another toast just to you, let’s dance off the beat
Then mosey out together and say goodbye on the street
You wanted to fight for a cause? Then go out and love someone
Don’t stop, don’t stop believing, In truth and personal freedom
I want someone to want me for who I am, I want someone to try and let me down

But I haven't stopped loving you once

46,Bitter,Palace,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/palace/bitter-chords-1906010,"  Lend me your brakes again
You're more than my speed
  And I’ve played heartstrings before
But not in your key
  You tell me you’re waiting for someone
But you haven’t heard, no
  You've broken promises to me
So forget your word
  And again, and again, you’re breaking me down
  Let me in, let me in
From the dark of this town
  Why am I bitter, bitter, bitter?
  Why am I always led astray?
  It’s gonna get better, better, better
  I’d always hear you say
  Tell me I’m great again
And I love you more
  Ride high fake confidence
Right down to my core
  Strike a nerve, like an airstrike raid
  I wear a mask to cover myself
  And again, and again, you’re breaking me down
  Let me in, let me in
From the dark of this town
  Why am I bitter, bitter, bitter?
  Why am I always led astray?
  It’s gonna get better, better, better
  I’d always hear you say
Woah, don’t let me down, oh
Woah, don’t let me down, oh

Guess I've been taking a lot from you  ah ah ah ah
Searching so long for the truth ah ah ah ah
You hope that girl would chase you out the door
As you think that it's already too late
Searching for meaning in a combination of notes
Don't overthink it, don't overthink it
Tired to wake so early
Get up in the morning  it just hurts
And I think of all those little things that you and I can do
And now I've taken too many hits
And I'm breaking off with all that stuff
Anybody else wants some? that's no good reason
Broke up with Edison, I've had enough ah
Shy, fast times in the park
Don't overthink it
Sorry  to wake so early
Get up in the morning, it just hurts
I don't wanna hear what I can't mime
Anywhere with you could change my mind
Somebody's taking much too long
Somebody's taking much too long
Don't call me stupid
Don't call me stupid
It's my life and I can delete it
Is that the life I lead?
All these surreal things and sudden decisions
Just wanna waste my time with you
I will leave it oh, in my dreams
I'll never let it bother me, it's not my style
I know you want it
I know you want it
Somebody's taking much too long
Somebody's taking much too long
Don't call me stupid
Don't call me stupid

For you to know
The awful truth
The truth about me, and the truth about you
Cause you're a brand new species
Big cat
Space Nazis
Robert Stack
God damn it, gonna snap
Leonard Nimoy, Call me back (Call me back)
I try to call you every day
I'm rehearsing what to say
When the truth comes out (Of my very own mouth)
I've been working on a unified theory
If I make it through tonight everybody's gonna hear me out
Cause I'm the right one
On my touch-tone, touch-tone telephone
I'm the only one
On your A.M., A.M. radio
Oh,    I'm crying now
Authentic tears
They flow out of me when I think about you
Cause you're the only person in the world who'd understand
Cause you're the only person in the world who'd understand the meaning of this
Oh My God
I try and I try and I try to make you listen to me
I try to call you every day
I'm rehearsing what to say
When the truth comes out (Of my very own mouth)

I'm an expert, I'm the one
The one who was right all along
Better to be laughed at than wrong
  I'm an expert in my field
UFOlogy, yes, it's all real
Ancient aliens, it's all true
I'm an expert just like you
And like you, I'm a genius before my time
Disbelieving, that's the real crime
Pretty soon they'll discover me in the Super-Sargasso Sea
I try to call you every day
What can I say
When the truth comes out (Of my very own mouth)
I've been working on a unified theory
If I make it through tonight everybody's gonna hear me out

On my touch-tone, touch-tone telephone

And then I'll have to buy another
It's not like we can't talk to eachother
Don't write a sad song
You'll burn out your love
And then you'll have to find another
I'm gonna shine on for my little brother
Hazy, lazy
Burning through my tree
She says that I'm crazy
But I don't let it faze me
Taste me, baby
Take me as you please
Take me as you please
I feel the sunshine
That burns away the cold
Pulling off the nylon cover
How many times can I say that I love her?
That's not for this song
Cause I'm done with all the noise
Know that we can talk to eachother
It's all good, it's all love, now it's over

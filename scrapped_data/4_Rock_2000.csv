We don't claim to be perfect but we're free
We dream our dreams alone with no resistance
Fading like the stars we wish to be
You know I didn't mean
What I just said
But my god woke up
on the wrong side of his bed
and it just don't matter now
'Cause little by little
We gave you everything you ever dreamed of
Little by little
The wheels of your life they're slowly falling off
Little by little
You have to give it all with all your life
And all the time, I just ask myself why
You're really here
True perfection has to be imperfect
I know that that sounds foolish but it's true
The day has come and now you'll have to accept
The life inside your head we give to you
You know I didn't mean
What I just said
But my god woke up
on the wrong side of his bed
and it just don't matter now
'Cause little by little
We gave you everything you ever dreamed of
Little by little
The wheels of your life they're slowly falling off
Little by little
You have to give it all with all your life
And all the time, I just ask myself why
You're really here
    hey!
'Cause little by little
We gave you everything you ever dreamed of
Little by little
The wheels of your life they're slowly falling off
Little by little
You have to give it all with all your life
And all the time, I just ask myself why
You're really here
Why am I really here?
Why am I really here?

Do you ever feel out of place?
Like somehow you just don't belong,
and no one understands you.
Do you ever wanna run away?
Do you lock yourself in your room?
With the radio on turned up so loud
That no one hears you screaming.
No you don't know what its like
When nothing feels alright
You don't know what its like to be like me
To be hurt, to feel lost, to be left out in the dark
To be kicked when you're down, to feel like you've been pushed around 
To be on the edge of breaking down, when no one's there to save you
No you don't know what its like
Welcome to my life 
Do you wanna be somebody else?
Are you sick of being so left out?
Are you desperate to find something more,
before your life is over?
Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
Are you sick of everyone around?
With the big fake smiles and stupid lies,
While deep inside you're bleeding
No you don't know what its like
When nothing feels alright
You don't know what its like to be like me
To be hurt, to feel lost, to be left out in the dark
To be kicked when your down, to feel like you've been pushed around
To be on the edge of breaking down, when no ones there to save you
No you don't know what its like
Welcome to my life
No one ever lies straight to your face
And no one ever stabs you in the back
You might think I'm happy 
But I'm not gonna be okay
Everybody always gave you what you wanted
You never had to work it was always there

And he just laughs at my plans,

Feel the home that I live in.

Running through my veins, going to waste.
I don’t wanna die,
But I ain’t keen on living either.
Before I fall in love,
I’m preparing to leave her.
I scare myself to death,
That’s why I keep on running.
Before I’ve arrived, 
I can see myself coming.

The Jesus of Suburbia
From the Bible of none of the above
On a steady diet of
Soda pop and Ritalin
No one ever died for my
Sins in hell, as far as I can tell
At least the ones I've gotten away with
And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make-believe
Get my television fix
Sitting on my crucifix
The living room or my private womb
While the moms and brads are away
To fall in love and fall in debt
To alcohol and cigarettes
And Mary Jane to keep me insane
And doing someone else's cocaine
And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make-believe
At the center of the earth
In the parking lot
Of the 7-11 where I was taught
  The motto was just a lie
It says ""home is where your heart is""
But what a shame
Cause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same
  It's beating out of time
   City of the dead
  At the end of another lost highway
   Signs misleading to nowhere
   City of the damned
  Lost children with dirty faces today
   No one really seems to care
I read the graffiti
In the bathroom stall
Like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall
  And so it seemed to confess
It didn't say much
But it only confirmed
That the center of the earth is the end of the world
  And I could really care less
   City of the dead
  At the end of another lost highway
   Signs misleading to nowhere
   City of the damned
  Lost children with dirty faces today

I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care   (x4)
I don’t care...

Born and raised by hypocrites
Hearts recycled but never saved
From the cradle to the grave
We are the kids of war and peace
From Anaheim to the Middle East
We are the stories and disciples
Of the Jesus of Suburbia
Land of make-believe
And it don't believe in me
Land of make-believe
And I don't believe
And I don’t care (x4)
And I don’t care
Dearly beloved are you listening?
I can’t remember a word that you were saying
Are we demented or am I disturbed?
The space that's in between insane and insecure
Oh therapy, can you please fill the void?
Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed
Nobody's perfect and I stand accused
For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse
To live and not to  breathe
Is to die in tragedy
To run, to run away
To find what you believe
And I..             Leave be.. hind
This hu..rri..cane of fu..cking lies
I lost my faith to this
This town that don't exist
So I run, I run away
To the light of masochist
And I..             Leave be.. hind
This hu..rri..cane of fu..cking lies
And I..             Walked this line
A    mil..lion and one fu..cking times       But not this time
I don't feel any shame
I won’t apologize
When there ain't nowhere you can go
Running away from pain
When you've been victimized
Tales from another broken...

You’re leaving...

And look up smiling at you 
I run and run 
 Past the pumpkin patch 
And the tractor rides look now,
The sky is gold 
 I hug your legs and fall asleep 
On the way home

 I know you’re not scared of anything at all 
 Don’t know if Snow White’s house is near or far away 
But I know I had the best day with you today 
 I’m thirteen now
And don’t know how my friends 
Could be so mean 
 I come home crying 
And you hold me tight 
And grab the keys 
 And we drive and drive 
Until we found a town 
Far enough away 
 And we talk and window-shop 
'til I’ve forgotten all their names 
 I don’t know who I’m gonna talk to now at school 
 I know I’m laughing on the car ride home with you 
 Don’t know how long it’s gonna take to feel okay 
But I know I had the best day with you today 
 I have an excellent father 
 His strength is making me stronger 
 God smiles on my little brother 
 Inside and out he’s better than I am
 I grew up in a pretty house 
And I had space to run 
And I had the best days with you 
 There is a video 
I found from back when I was three 
 You set up a paint set in the kitchen 
And you’re talking to me 
 It’s the age of princesses and pirate ships 
And the seven dwarves 
And Daddy’s smart and you're the prettiest lady
In the whole wide world 
 Now I know why all the trees change in the fall 
 I know you were on my side even when I was wrong 
And I love you for giving me your eyes 
 Staying back and watching me shine 
And I didn’t know if you knew

I hope they understand
I am not angry I am just saying
sometimes good bye is a second chance

46,Hanggang Kailan,Orange and Lemons,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/orange-and-lemons/hanggang-kailan-chords-190069,"Labis na naiinip
Nayayamot sa bawat saglit
Kapag naaalala ka
Wala naman akong
magawa
Umuwi ka na baby
Hindi na ako sanay ng wala ka
Mahirap ang mag-isa
At sa gabi'y hinahanap-hanap
kita.
Hanggang kailan ako maghihintay
Na makasama ka muli
Sa buhay kong puno ng paghihirap
Na tanging ikaw lang ang
Pumapawi sa mga luha
At naglalagay ng ngiti
sa mga labi
'Di mapigilang mag-isip
Na baka sa tagal
Mahulog ang loob mo sa iba
Nakakabalisa, knock on wood
'Wag naman sana
Umuwi ka na baby
Hindi na ako sanay ng wala ka
Mahirap ang mag-isa
At sa gabi'y hinahanap-hanap
kita.
Hanggang kailan ako maghihintay
Na makasama ka muli
Sa buhay kong puno ng paghihirap
Na tanging ikaw lang ang
Pumapawi sa mga luha
At naglalagay ng ngiti
sa mga labi
Umuwi ka na baby...
Umuwi ka na baby...
Umuwi ka na baby...
Umuwi ka na baby...
Umuwi ka na baby...
Umuwi ka na baby...

All my guts, try to spill
All my money been a long time spent
On my saving philosophy
It goes, one in the bank, and the rest for me
It goes, all my troubles on a burning pile
All lit up and I start to smile
If I, catch fire then I change my aim
Throw my troubles at the pearly gates
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh-oh, oh oh-uh
ohhh-oh
   uh ohhh-oh
My mama, lonely maid
My papa, renaissance man
Sailed away and he never came back again
All my troubles on a burning pile
All lit up and I start to smile
If I, catch fire then I change my aim
Throw my troubles at the pearly gates
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
All you woebegones be gone
I said all you troubles, you don't mean a thing
All my troubles on a burning pile
All lit up and I start to smile
If I, catch fire then I change my aim
Throw my troubles at the world again
It goes, all my troubles on a burning pile
All lit up and I start to smile
If I, catch fire then I'll take my turn
To burn and burn, and burn and burn

48,Your Body Is A Wonderland (ver 2),John Mayer,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-mayer/your-body-is-a-wonderland-chords-379339,"We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me
Discovering you
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue
And if you want love
We'll make it
Swimming a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while
Your body Is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder
(I'll use my hands)
Your body Is a wonderland   
Something 'bout the way your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go and,though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed without my hand behind it
And if you want love
We'll make it
Swimming a deep sea
Of blankets
Take all your big plans
And break 'em
This is bound to be a while
Your body Is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder
(I'll use my hands)
Your body Is a wonderland  
     Damn baby, you frustrate me
    I know you're mine all mine all mine
Your body Is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder

Your body is a wonderland

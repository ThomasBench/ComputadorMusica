0,Chasing Echoes,Poets of the Fall,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/poets-of-the-fall/chasing-echoes-chords-4177870,"Is the dream still alive? Still the image
Of perfection?
Sweet little delight, a happy disaster
An easy lie?
Well, sometimes hurt befriends rejection
It’s kinda rich, I know
When you’re the one denied
Ooh, ooh
Is this a role or disguise
Seeking mercy in creation?
Just another device
Or truly a time when we will rise?
Oh one and all, to the occasion
And bridge the gap to see the other sidе?
 Where day and night becomе vertigo
 You still light up my soul like a burning halo
Where, wrong or right, we go on with the show
Looking for something more, chasing echoes
Ooh ooh
Are you really surprised to hear
The daydream shop went bankrupt?
Truly beside yourself
'Cause the carnival closed down?
When the show suddenly
Stops, no matter how much you’ve got
 Where day and night becomе vertigo
 You still light up my soul like a burning halo
Where, wrong or right, we go on with the show
Looking for something more, chasing echoes
Ooh ooh
Here we go shamelessly courting the vices, the
Virtues, the trifles until we bring down the world
 Pleasure highs within meanings lost
 Looking for a quick fix
Fulfilment fast lane
Pleasure lies about the cost
Of keeping the dream alive…
Alive…
 Where day and night becomе vertigo
 You still light up my soul like a burning halo
Where, wrong or right, we go on with the show
Looking for something more, chasing echoes
Ooh, looking for something more, chasing echoes
Ooh ooh

Single in our nature, and because of the times
Not a word was said when the lights came on
Or a glance given pause at the cost of our desired wrongs
It's second nature to love you, it's first to die
And we were killed upon waking, killed upon waking to the life
We weren't prepared to live but rebelled to realize
We were killed upon the pavement, Bonnie we're immortalized in
Blood, cold, cold love, we were still young
When the radio lights came on
Elton's on the air, no fair dear that we were still here
In the absence of everything, abstain from fear
And if I cry in your arms
Just some other shit, just some other shit
Just some other things that I've been dealing with
I'd die in your arms, bury me while playing this
Bury me saying ""You were all I ever needed""
And hold me like we're dying from the liquor that we drank
Down in hotel rooms, to feel warm in cold love
   What's harder, harder to say?
That you want me to stay
That you want me to stay unchanged for you?
Chained to a lie, we're the same, you and I, we're the same
Not the same, we hurt differently,  but consistent in our pain
Equal and equidistant in the way we laugh
To lay bare the weight of our cold love affair
Recalling the days where we were, we weren't, we were
Wrong for the papers, wrong for the dinner tables
Of the inner rings of the rich and famous anything's
It's gone, not bad, just gone, my bad, just wrong, we had
And we had, and we were then in
Blood, cold, cold love, we were still young
When the radio lights came on
Elton's on the air, no fair dear that we were still here
In the absence of everything, abstain from fear
And if I cry in your arms
Just some other shit, just some other shit
Just some other things that I've been dealing with
I'd die in your arms, bury me while playing this
Bury me saying ""You were all I ever needed""
And hold me like we're dying from the liquor that we drank
Down in hotel rooms, to feel warm
   What's harder, harder to say?
That you want me to stay
That you want me to stay unchanged for you?
Chained to a lie, we're the same, you and I, we're the same
   What's harder, harder to fake?
That you want me to stay
That you want me to stay the same for you?
Chained to a lie, who's to blame? Let it die, we're the sa-ame
In blood, cold, cold love, we were still young
When the radio lights came on
Elton's on the air

And now he stands outside and all the neighbours start to gossip and drool.
He cries ""Oh girl, you must be mad,
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?""
Against the door he leans and starts a scene,
And his tears fall and burn the garden green.
A little Indian brave who before he was ten, 
played war games in the woods with his Indian friends, 
and he built a dream that when he grew up,
he would be a fearless warrior Indian Chief.
Many moons passed and more the dream grew strong, until tomorrow
He would sing his first war song,
And fight his first battle, but something went wrong,
Suprise attack killed him in his sleep that night
There was a young girl, whose heart was a frown,
Because she was crippled for life, and couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed she would stop 
living,so she decided to die.
She drew her wheel chair to the edge of the shore, 
and to her legs she smiled: ""You won't hurt me no more.""
But then a sight she'd never seen made her JUMP AND SAY
""Look, a golden winged ship is passing my way""

You turned into everything that you hate

My heart is out in the garbage
I am being
An alarmist
Cause for as far as I see
It’s terrible territory
And there’s no one
To reassure me
So it would be good to talk
For my sanity
Now do what you feel like you gotta do
But be good to me
When you walk away
You still exist and I feel good knowing it

Why'd I rely so much on it in the first place?
If it's happening

Dad had bloody heavy hands, used them on me
My mamma? Bless her heart, 'cause she gave me a start
She got killed, bad man, dad stiffed in a scam
Grew up in the system, bounced, couple homes
This woman Mary, gifted me hand-me-down clothes
Shy at the start, 'til this guy named Shifty
Who had 100 pounds on me called me ""Brittle Bones Nicky""
A target aimed straight at my face
Big house of kids, cred is cake
Rounded up a couple bucks, got it freshly baked
Sat down to dinner
Put it right in his face
Right in his fucking face (In his face!)

You can't get me down, down, down (Down!)
You're not gonna push me around (Nooo!)
You can't get me down, down, down (Down!)
Bounce ahead a couple years, king of my peers
We biked the block, cheersin' pretty girls beers
Did alright for myself, petty thefts I pulled
I dropped outta school, built a circle of bulls
Needing more money, covered head to toe
Snuck up, sucker, took his stash, and drove
The cash stashed, it was pouring in
Bulk of it up my nose
How dumb I was, twenty-one
And WAY out of control
The cops kicked down the door
She did a line right off my (Woah!)
Said ""That's one way to go down""

You can't get me down, down, down (Down!)
Bars, new world, who could I trust?
Killers were nice, smugglers were rough
Met a man named Ben, quite sharp and witty
Gave me books about money and cities
Taught me ropes, only years coulda gained
Looked out for each other, M.O's the same
That night I heard Ben, turning 50 in May
Yellin' so loud, two decades we aged
Found him cornered, pants down, shanked
Didn't even think twice, man I barely blinked
If it cost me my life, man, I'd save my only friend
That's something I could live with
I could take that 'til the end

Now every morning, coffee, park
Walking around the city, deals light or dark
I'm straight edge as a punk, well-mannered, and I feel free
Tried to do what I thought was best
And that's coming to the grave with me
As I lay here in my final nights, I try to have a laugh
I didn't win the game of life
But I'd give myself a pass

Got a place on the other side of London
Doing better, doing better
And I know you left a part of you
In New York under your bed in a box
But you're doing better, doing better

When you give so much, but it's not enough
When the high's too high, and the low's too low
When you love someone and they let you go
Don't you let it kill you
Even when it hurts like hell
Oh, whatever tears you apart
Don't let it break your heart
Time takes time to heal it
You can't do it by yourself
Oh, whatever tears you apart
Don't let it break your heart
It comes and it goes
We're driving down a one-way road
To something better, something better
What hurts you is gonna pass
And you'll have learnt from it when it comes back
You'll be doing better
Yeah, doing better
'Cause life gets hard and it gets messed up
When you give so much, but it's not enough
When the high's too high, and the low's too low

Something that you said
Only bad examples left
All the good ones dead

Found my love, born to obey

I wear camouflage to blend in

They're probably calling the cops on me right now

I mean obviously I'm distant, I'm a thousand miles away
Obviously it's tense, there's nothing else to say

To feel the color of the longest day

But the horizon's lifting away from me
& it seems endless

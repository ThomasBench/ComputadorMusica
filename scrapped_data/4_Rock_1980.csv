0,And So It Goes,Billy Joel,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/billy-joel/and-so-it-goes-chords-736386,"In every heart there is a room 
A sanctuary safe and strong 
To heal the wounds from lovers past 
Until a new one comes along 
I spoke to you in cautious tones 
You answered me with no pretense 
And still I feel I said too much 
My silence is my self defense 
And every time I've held a rose 
It seems I only felt the thorns 
And so it goes, and so it goes 
And so will you soon I suppose 
But if my silence made you leave 
Then that would be my worst mistake 
So I will share this room with you 
And you can have this heart to break 
And this is why my eyes are closed 
It's just as well for all I've seen 
And so it goes, and so it goes 
And you're the only one who knows 
So I would choose to be with you 
That's if the choice were mine to make 
But you can make decisions too 
And you can have this heart to break
And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows

3,Too Much Love Will Kill You,Queen,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/queen/too-much-love-will-kill-you-chords-576070,"I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
I'm far away from home
And I've been facing this alone
For much too long
Oh, I feel like no-one ever told the truth to me
About growing up and what a struggle it would be
In my tangled state of mind
I've been looking back to find
Where I went wrong
Too much love will kill you
If you can't make up your mind
Torn between the lover
And the love you leave behind
You're headed for disaster
'Cos you never read the signs
Too much love will kill you
Every time
I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
I used to bring you sunshine
Now all I ever do is bring you down
Ooh, how would it be if you were standing in my shoes
Can't you see that it's impossible to choose
No there's no making sense of it
Every way I go I'm bound to lose
Too much love will kill you
Just as sure as none at all
It'll drain the power that's in you
Make you plead and scream and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy
You're the victim of your crime
Too much love will kill you
Every time
Yes, too much love will kill you
It'll make your life a lie
Yes, too much love will kill you
And you won't understand why
You'd give your life, you'd sell you soul
But here it comes again
Too much love will kill you

I want a ticket to anywhere.
Maybe we make a deal,
Maybe together we can  get somewhere.
Any place is better.
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose.
Maybe we'll make something,
Me myself, I got nothing to prove.
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living
You see my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""somebody's got to take care of him""
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
But is it fast enough so we can fly away
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way
I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I.... had a feeling that I belonged
And I.... had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
Well move out of the shelter
Buy a big house and live in the suburbs
I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I.... had a feeling that I belonged
And I.... had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
And I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you  do of your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving
I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped round my shoulder
And I.... had a feeling that I belonged
And I.... had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car

Crashing headlong into the heartland, like a cannon in the rain
With the beating of the sleepers, and the burning of the coal
Counting towns flashing by me, in a night that's full of soul
With light in my head, you in my arms, woo woo ooh

And the chains all hung around me, will fall away at last
And on that fine and fateful day, I will take thee in my hands

When I'm far from home  Don't call me on the phone To tell me you're alone

Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Got no human grace your eyes without a face.
  I spend so much time   believing all the lies   to keep the dream alive
 Now it makes me sad    It makes me mad at truth   For loving what was you
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face
Got no human grace your eyes without a face.
 Now I close my eyes  And I wonder why  I don't despise
 Now all I can do   Is love what was once    So alive and new
But it's gone from your eyes        I'd better realize
Les yeux sans visage eyes without a face

but it was long ago.
Janey was lovely; she was the queen of my nights,
there in the darkness with the radio, playing low and
The secrets that we shared,  
the mountains that we moved
Caught like wildfire out of control,
‘till there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove.
And I remember what she said to me,
how she swore that it never would end.
I remember how she held me, oh so tight.
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then.
Against the wind, we were running against the wind.
We were young and strong, we were running against the wind.
And the years rolled slowly past.  
And I found myself alone.
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends, 
I found myself further and further from my home. 
There were oh, so many roads.
I was living to run, and running to live.
Never worrying about paying, or even how much I owed.
Runnin' 8 miles a minute for months at a time,
breaking all of the rules that would bend. 
I begin to find myself just searching,
searching for shelter again and again.
Against the wind,  a little something against the wind.
I found myself seeking shelter against the wind.
Well those drifter's days are past me now,
I've got so much more to think about.
Deadlines and commitments;  
what to leave in, what to leave out.

I'm still running against the wind.
I'm older now but still running against the wind.

Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby why don't we go, Jamaica
Off the Florida Keys
   There's a place called Kokomo
   That's where you wanna go to get away from it all
  Bodies in the sand
  Tropical drink melting in your hand
  We'll be falling in love to the rhythm of a steel drum band
  Down in Kokomo
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take ya to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo Montego, ooh I wanna take her down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go
  Way down in Kokomo
Martinique, that Monserate mystique
  We'll put out to sea
  And we'll perfect our chemistry
  By and by we'll defy a little bit of gravity
  Afternoon delight
  Cocktails and moonlit nights
  That dreamy look in your eye give me a tropical contact high
  Way down in Kokomo
Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take ya to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, ooh I wanna take her down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow

Everybody knows
A little place like Kokomo
Now if you wanna go and get away from it all
Go down to Kokomo

We'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow

Went down to see my V.A. man
He said ""Son, don't you understand""
I had a brother at Khe Sahn
They're still there, he's all gone
He had a woman he loved in Saigon
I got a picture of him in her arms now
Down in the shadow of the penitentiary
I'm ten years burning down the road

  and there you were
  I needed someone to understand my ups and downs

   deeply touching my emotion
I want to stop and thank you baby
I want to stop and thank you baby, yes I do

  How sweet it is to be loved by you
  I close my eyes at night,
wondering where would I be without you in my life
  Everything I did was just a bore,
everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brightened up for me all of my days
   With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby
  How sweet it is to be loved by you, just like sugar sometimes
  How sweet it is to be loved by you
 You were better to me than I was to myself
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else

For the longest time
Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
If you said goodbye to me tonight
There would still be music left to write
What else could I do
I'm so inspired by you
That hasn't happened for the longest time
Once I thought my innocence was gone
Now I know that happiness goes on
That's where you found me
When you put your arms around me
I haven't been there for the longest time
Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time
Oh, oh, oh
For the longest
I'm that voice you're hearing in the hall
And the greatest miracle of all
Is how I need you
And how you needed me too
That hasn't happened for the longest time
Maybe this won't last very long
But you feel so right
And I could be wrong
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
But I've gone this far
And it's more than I hoped for
Who knows how much further we'll go on
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I haven't been there for the longest time
I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself
Hold on to your heart
Now I know the woman that you are
You're wonderful so far
And it's more than I hoped for
I don't care what consequence it brings
I have been a fool for lesser things
I want you so bad
I think you ought to know that
I intend to hold you for the longest time
Oh, oh, oh
For the longest time

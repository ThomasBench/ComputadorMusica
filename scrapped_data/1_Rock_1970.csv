0,Hotel California,Eagles,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/eagles/hotel-california-chords-46190,"  On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
  Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
  Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
   My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
  I had to stop for the night
  There she stood in the doorway; I heard the mission bell
  And I was thinking to myself
This could be heaven or this could be hell
  Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way
   There were voices down the corridor,
  I thought I heard them say...
  Welcome to the Hotel California.
Such a lovely place, (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year, (any time of year) You can find it here
 Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, She got the Mercedes bends
 She got a lot of pretty pretty boys   she calls friends
  How they danced in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
  Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
  So I called up the captain; Please bring me my wine (he said)
 We haven't had that spirit here since 1969
  and still those voices are calling from far away
   Wake you up in the middle of the night
  Just to hear them say...
 Welcome to the Hotel California.
Such a lovely place, (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
They're livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise, (what a nice surprise) Bring your alibis
   Mirrors on the ceiling; the pink champagne on ice (and she said)
  We are all just prisoners here, of our own device
  and in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
 They stab it with their steely knives but they
just can't kill the beast
   Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
  I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
  ""Relax"" said the night man; we are programmed to receive
  You can check out any time you like
 But you can never leave...

1,Wish You Were Here,Pink Floyd,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/pink-floyd/wish-you-were-here-chords-44555,"So, so you think you can tell,
Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail, a smile from a veil,
Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts,
Hot ashes for trees, hot air for a cool breeze, cold comfort for change,
And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?
How I wish, how I wish you were here.
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
 Running over the same old ground. What have we found?
The same old fears. Wish you were here!

I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy, if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor,   but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words,
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
I sat on the roof     and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses, well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind, while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
So excuse me forgetting,   but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind

6,Vienna,Billy Joel,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/billy-joel/vienna-chords-804911,"   Slow down you crazy child
You're so ambitious for a juvenile
But then if you're so smart tell me why
Are you still so afraid
   Where's the fire, what's the hurry about
You better cool it off before you burn it out
You got so much to do and only
So many hours in a day
   But you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want
Or you can just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through
When will you realize
  Vienna waits for you
   Slow down you're doing fine
You can't be everything you want to be
Before your time
Although it's so romantic on the borderline tonight, tonight
   Too bad but it's the life you lead
You're so ahead of yourself
That you forgot what you need
Though you can see when you're wrong
You know you can't always see when you're right, you're ri  -  ight
   You got your passion, you got your pride
But don't you know that only fools are satisfied
   Dream on, but don't imagine they'll all come true
When will you realize
  Vienna waits for you
   Slow down you crazy child
And take the phone off the hook
And disappear for a while
   It's alright, you can afford to lose a day or two
When will you realize
  Vienna waits for you
   And you know that when the truth is told
That you can get what you want
Or you can just get old
You're gonna kick off before you even get halfway through
Why don't you realize
  Vienna waits for you
   When will you realize
  Vienna waits for you

Is this just fantasy
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go,
little high, little low,
Any way the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me,
To me
Mama, just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head,
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead,
Mama, life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all  away
Mama ooooh,
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time,
Goodbye everybody - I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face   the truth
Mama ooooh (any way the wind blows)
I don't want to die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouche, scaramouche, will you do the Fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning, very very frightening me
I'm just a poor boy, no-body loves me.
He's just a poor boy from a poor fami-ly.
Spare him his life from this monstrosity.
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?  Bismillah!
No, we will not let you go.  Bismillah!
We will not let you go.  Bismillah!  We will not let you go.
Will not let you go.  Will not let you go. Ahhhhhhhhh
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, mama mia, mama mia
Mama mia, let me go.  Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me,
  So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
  So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby - can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here
Nothing really matters,
Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters, nothing really matters to me,

I was once like you are now, and I know that it's not easy
To be calm when you've found something going on
But take your time, think a lot, why think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not
How can I try to explain? 'cause when I do he turns away again
It's always been the same, same old story
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen

If the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for.
Ooh, ooh, Ooh, ooh and she’s buying a stairway to heaven.
There’s a sign on the wall
But she wants to be sure
cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
In a tree by the brook
There’s a songbird who sings,
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.
Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Ooh,      and it makes me wonder.
There’s a feeling I get
When I look to the west,
And my spirit is crying for leaving.
In my thoughts I have seen
Rings of smoke through the trees,
And the voices of those who stand looking.
Ooh, it makes me wonder,
Ooh,      and it makes me wonder.
And its whispered that soon
If we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason.
And a new day will dawn
For those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter.
Ooooh
Oooooooh
If there’s a bustle in your hedgerow
Don’t be alarmed now,
It’s just a spring clean for the may queen.
Yes, there are two paths you can go by
But in the long run
There’s still time to change the road you’re on.
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Your head is humming and it won’t go
In case you don’t know,
The pipers calling you to join him,
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow,
And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul.
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold.
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last.
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll.
And she’s buying a stairway to heaven.

Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?
Come on now
I hear you're feeling down
I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
   You are only coming through in waves
   Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

My hands felt just like two balloons
  Now I've got that feeling once again, I can't explain,
You would not understand, This is not how I am

There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!

Can you stand up?

That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go.
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
    You are only coming through in waves
    Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

Out of the corner of my eye
    I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown, The dream is gone
And  I           have become comfortably numb.

Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim,
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway;
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself,
this could be heaven or this could be hell
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor,
I thought I heard them say...
Welcome to the hotel California;
such a lovely place,
such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the hotel California,
any time of year, you can find it here
Her mind is tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes Benz
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I called up the captain,
please bring me my wine
He said, we haven t had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night,
just to hear them say
Welcome to the hotel California;
such a lovely place,
such a lovely face
They re living it up at the hotel California
What a nice surprise, bring your alibis
Mirrors on the ceiling,
the pink champagne on ice
And she said we are all just prisoners here, of our own device
And in the master s chambers,
they gathered for the feast
The stab it with their steely knives,
but they just can t kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
running for the door
I had to find the passage back,
to the place I was before
relax, said the night man,
we are programmed to receive.
You can checkout any time you like,
but you can never leave!

When are you gonna come down
When are you going to land
I should have stayed on the farm, should have
Listened to my old man
You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing
The blues... Ah...... Ah....
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plow
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road ...
Ah..... Ah......
What do you think you'll do then?
I bet they'll shoot down the plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again
Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you
On the ground... Ah....  Ah....
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plow
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today
     And then one day you find,   ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run ... You missed the starting gun
And you run and you run to catch up with the Sun, but it's sinking;
Racing around to come up behind you again.
The Sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older,
shorter of breath, and one day closer to death.
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time.
Plans that either come to naught, or half a page of scribbled lines.
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way.
The time is gone, the song is over. Thought I'd something more to say.
 Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
 When I come home, cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away, across the field
Tolling on the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spell

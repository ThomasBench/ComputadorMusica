Mother, do you think they'll like this song?
Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls?
Ooh ah, Mother, should I build the wall?
Mother, should I run for president?
Mother, should I trust the government?
Mother, will they put me in the firing line?
Ooh ah, is it just a waste of time
Hush now baby, baby, don't you cry.
Mamma's gonna make all of your nightmares come true,
Mamma's gonna put all of her fears into you,
Mamma's gonna keep you right here, under her wing.
She won't let you fly, but she might let you sing,
Mamma's gonna keep baby cosy and warm.
Oooh babe,
Oooh babe,
  Ooh baby, of course Mamma's gonna help build the wall.
Mother, do you think she's good enough,      for me?
Mother, do you think she's dangerous,      to me?
Mother, will she tear your little boy apart?
Ooh ah, Mother, will she break my heart?
Hush now baby, baby, don't you cry.
Mamma's going to check out all your girlfriends for you,
Mamma won't let anyone dirty get through,
Mamma's gonna wait up until you get in.
Mamma will always find out where you've been,
Mamma's gonna keep baby healthy and clean.
Oooh babe,
Oooh babe,
  Ooh babe, you'll always be baby to me.
Mother, did it need to be so high?

Must have a code that you can live by
And so become yourself
Because the past is just a good-bye.
Teach your children well,
Their father's hell did slowly go by,
And feed them on your dreams
The one they picked's the one you'll know by.
Don't you ever ask them why, if they told you, you will cry,
So just look at them and sigh
and know they love you.
And you, of tender years,
Can't know the fears that your elders grew by,
And so please help them with your youth,
They seek the truth before they can die.
Teach your parents well,
Their children's hell will slowly go by,
And feed them on your dreams
The one they picked's the one you'll know by.
Don't you ever ask them why, if they told you, you will cry,
So just look at them and sigh
and know they love you.

3,Born To Run,Bruce Springsteen,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bruce-springsteen/born-to-run-chords-320030,"In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream
At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines
Sprung from cages on highway 9, chrome-wheeled, fuel-injected
and steppin' out over the line, whoah!
Baby this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap, we gotta get out while we're young
'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run
Wendy let me in, I wanna be your friend, I want to guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet rims, and strap your hands across my engines
Together we could break this trap, we'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back, whoah!
Will you walk with me out on the wire? 'Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta find out how it feels
I want to know if love is wild, babe, I want to know if love is real
Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard
Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors, and the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark, kids are huddled on the beach in a mist
I wanna die with you Wendy on the streets tonight in an ever - lasting kiss
       one two three four  
The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive
Everybody's out on the run tonight but there's no place left to hide
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul, whoah!
Someday girl, I don't know when, we're gonna get to that place
Where we really want to go and we'll walk in the sun
But till then, tramps like us, baby we were born to run
Ah honey, tramps like us, baby we were born to run
Come on Wendy, tramps like us, baby we were born to run
Oh-hhh

        Je dois juste m'assoir, je ne dois pas parler,
        Je ne dois rien vouloir, je dois juste essayer de lui appartenir,

It's seven o'clock and I want to rock
Want to get a belly full of beer
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair
Ohhhhhhh
 Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline

I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
I may sink a little drink and shout out ""She's with me!""
A couple of the sounds that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass

You Catholic girls start much too late
But sooner or later it comes down to fate
I might as well be the one
Well, They showed you a statue, told you to pray
They built you a temple and locked you away
But they never told you the price that you pay
For things that you might have done
Only the good die young
  Thats What I Said
only the good die young
only the good die young
You might have heard I run with a dangerous crowd
We ain't too pretty we ain't too proud
We might be laughing a bit too loud
But that never hurt no one
So come on Virginia show me a sign
Send up a signal I'll throw you the line
The stained-glass curtain you're hiding behind
Never lets in the sun
Darlin' only the good die young
  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
  i tell ya only the good die young
only the good die young
You got a nice white dress and a party on your confirmation
You got a brand new soul, And a cross of gold
But Virginia they didn't give you quite enough information
You didn't count on me when you were counting on your rosary
oh woah woah
They say there's a heaven for those who will wait
Some say it's better but I say it ain't
I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
the Sinners are much more fun
you know that only the good die young
 oh woah baby
 i tell ya only the good die young
only the good die young
You say your mother told you all that I could give you was a reputation
Aww She never cared for me
But did she ever say a prayer for me?

On my hands and my knees, I will roll, roll, roll.

In my time, In my time, I will roll, roll roll.
In a bed, in a bed,
By the waterside I will lay my head.
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul.
River going to take me, sing me sweet and sleepy,
Sing me sweet and sleepy all the way back home.
It's a far gone lullaby, sung many years ago.
Mama, mama many worlds I've come since I first left home.
Goin' home, goin' home,
By the waterside I will rest my bones,
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul.
Going to plant a weeping willow,
On the bank's green edge it will grow, grow, grow.
Sing a lullaby beside the water,
Lovers come and go, the river roll, roll, roll.
Fare you well, fare you well,
I love you more than words can tell,
Listen to the river sing sweet songs, to rock my soul.

The wild and windy night, that the rain  washed away,
   Has left a pool of tears,         crying for the day.
  Why leave me standing here?          Let me know the way.
Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried.
Anyway you'll never know the many ways I've tried.
But still they lead me back,  to the long winding road.
   You left me standing here,          a long, long time ago.
  Don’t leave me waiting here,         lead me to your door.
But still they lead me back,  to the long winding road.

     Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah.
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you.

I've loved you from the moment, I saw you.
You looked at me, that's all you had to do.
I feel it now, I hope you feel it too.

But he knew it couldn't last.
Jojo left his home in Tuscon, Arizona,
For some California grass.

Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas (bud of marijuana)
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
This could be heaven or this could be hell
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say?
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
She calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here
Since nineteen sixty-nine""
And still those voices
Are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say...
Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They living' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said ""We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device""
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place, I was before
""Relax"", said the night man
""We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave!""

Looking for the new world
In that palace in the sun
On the shore lay Montezuma
With his coca leaves and pearls
In his halls he often wandered
With the secrets of the worlds
And his subjects gathered 'round him
Like the leaves around a tree
In their clothes of many colours
For the angry gods to see
And the women all were beautiful
And the men stood straight and strong
They offered life in sacrifice
So that others could go on
Hate was just a legend
And war was never known
The people worked together
And they lifted many stones
They carried them to the flatlands
But they died along the way
And they built up with their bare hands
What we still can't do today
And I know she's living there
And she loves me to this day
I still can't remember when
Or how I lost my way

Where those fishing boats with their sails afloat, if I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes, how happy I'd be
Gonna see my baby again; Gonna be with some of my friends
Maybe I'll feel better again on Blue Bayou
Saving nickels, saving dimes; working till the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times on Blue Bayou
I'm going back someday, come what may to Blue Bayou
Where the folks are fine, and the world is mine on Blue Bayou
Where those fishing boats with their sails afloat, if I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes, how happy I'd be
Oh, that boy of mine by my side, the silver moon and the evening time
Oh, some sweet day, gonna take away this hurtin' inside
Well, I'd never be blue, my dreams come true
On Blue Ba - you

Got to sit down, take a rest on the porch.
Imagination sets in, pretty soon I'm singing,
doo, doo, doo, lookin' out my back door.
There's a giant doing cartwheels, a statue wearin' high heels,
look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn.
A dinosaur Victrola, listening to Buck Owens
doo, doo, doo, lookin' out my back door.
Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band,
won't you take a ride on the flyin' spoon ?
Wond'rous apparition, provided by magician,
doo, doo, doo, lookin' out my back door.
Tambourines and elephants are playing in the band,
won't you take a ride on the flyin' spoon ?
Bother me tomorrow, today I'll buy no sorrows,
doo, doo, doo, lookin' out my back door.
Forward troubles Illinois, lock the front door, oh boy !
Look at all the happy creatures dancing on the lawn.
Bother me tomorrow, today I'll buy no sorrows
doo, doo, doo, lookin' out my back door.

I me mine I me mine I me mine
All through the night
I me mine I me mine I me mine
Now they're frightened of leaving it
Everyone's weaving it
Coming on strong all the time
All through the day, I me mine
   I me me mine!
   I me me mine!
   I me me mine!
   I me me mine!
All I can hear
I me mine I me mine I me mine
Even those tears
I me mine I me mine I me mine
No ones frightened of playing it
Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through the day, I me mine
   I me me mine!
   I me me mine!
   I me me mine!
   I me me mine!
All I can hear
I me mine I me mine I me mine
Even those tears
I me mine I me mine I me mine
No ones frightened of playing it
Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through the day, I me mine

You've made that really clear
I'm just so sad
It comes of as insincere
I don't think it matters
Matters to you
There's always something more
That I could do
It doesn't even matter
'cause I don't wanna go
To college or to heaven
Or to anywhere alone
Nothing really matters
From my point of view
Sitting here and watching it unfold with you
I'm really doing better
And that's a crazy thing
I really thought that by this time this year
I'd be deceased
I'm trying really hard
To figure it out
But everything's just crumbling
Crumbling down
It doesn't fucking matter
If I don't wanna go
To college or to heaven
Or to anywhere alone
Nothing really matters
From my point of view
Sitting here and watching it all burn with you
On the goddamn news with you

 So I'll stick to nothing

For just one morning
Where I wake up and
My thoughts aren’t running
From the western world
That’s constantly calling
But I’m a westerner
Ain’t irony something

It gives you everything

  Now it’s just a spot where I wonder where you are
People break people try
Things happen people cry
Someone leaves love dies
Someone changes their mind
Baby I get it I really do
But now I gotta go and do the hardest part
Break the news to a broken hеart
  The ice on Hawk Lake this timе of year
  Broken and busted just like my bathroom mirror
  So hard to see what lies there beneath
  Shattered reflections like the pieces of me
People break people try
Things happen people cry
Someone leaves love dies
Someone changes their mind
Baby I get it I really do
But now I gotta go and do the hardest part
Break the news to a broken hеart
And where I’m going now man, I don’t really know

But it’s a broken heartland tonight

4,La Scelta,CapaRezza,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/caparezza/la-scelta-chords-3664331,"Da grande suonerò la ""Pastorale""
Ora sul piano resto curvo come un pastorale
Mio padre è d'umore un po' grigio, mi vuole prodigio
Padre lascia stare l'alcol, ti rovini
Sei severo quando faccio tirocini
Io sono romantico, ma pure tu
Mi vedi solo come un mazzo di fiorini
Sono Ludovico, culto, mito
Donne mi scansano come avessi avuto il tifo
Troppi affanni, a trent'anni ho perduto udito
Tu mi parli e mi pari un fottuto mimo
Se la mettiamo su questo piano la mia vita ha senso se la mettiamo su questo piano
Quindi prendo lo sgabellino e lascio la corda
Canto l'""Inno alla gioia""
Perché vedo l'abisso ma su questo, plano
Scrivo mille lettere, faccio rumore
Lotto col silenzio, ma ce la farò
Tengo la mia musica, lascio l'amore
Io sarò immortale, la mia amata no
E sono contento della scelta che ho fatto
Nemmeno un rimorso, nemmeno un rimpianto
Sì, sono contento, che bella scoperta
Non serve nient'altro che fare una scelta
Patetica, eroica, patetica, eroica, patetica, eroica
Questa è la mia vita non dimenticarlo
Patetica, eroica, patetica, eroica, patetica, eroica
Questa è la mia vita non dimenticarlo
Questa è la mia vita non dimenticarlo
Mi chiamo Marco, sento il gelo dei riflettori
Vorrei rimanerne fuori ma il mondo vuole che vada in tour
Entro in classifica perché la fama è cieca
Così cieca che in fondo non mi riguarda più
Vale come un disco d'oro in cassa da morto
Voglio fissare mio figlio, il tempo passa e m'accorgo
Che sto fissando un foglio tipo carta da forno
Ehi, sono Marco, new romantico
Sotto palco scompaio, ""puff"" come borotalco
Che guaio, bruciano il mio contratto
Ché il sound è cupo, rarefatto
Ho preparato un ritiro veloce
La mia famiglia è più importante di un giro di note
E questi parlano, parlano mentre io
Sto ricucendo la vita con un filo di voce
E non lascio lettere, niente rumore
Amo il mio silenzio e non comprendi quanto
Grazie per gli applausi, ma ho scelto l'amore
Questa è la mia vita non dimenticarlo
 E sono contento della scelta che ho fatto
Nemmeno un rimorso, nemmeno un rimpianto
Sì, sono contento, che bella scoperta
Non serve nient'altro che fare una scelta
Patetica, eroica, patetica, eroica, patetica, eroica
Questa è la mia vita non dimenticarlo
Patetica, eroica, patetica, eroica, patetica, eroica
Questa è la mia vita non dimenticarlo
Questa è la mia vita non dimenticarlo

E una pastiglia che comincia con la x
Lascio fuori nel bidone dell'Humana la mia buona volontà
Che l'ho già usata troppo
La maledico da quanto mi limita
Dentro solo anziani e spacciatori (E tossici)
E muratori in sosta, direzione Milanofiori
Tengo gli occhi bassi come le frequenze dentro ai cessi dei locali
Mi rimbomba ancora tutto
Quindi il silenzio qui non è poi così brutto
Ho sentito soltanto il bisogno di fare (Eh)
Qualcosa di buono, qualcosa di normale (Normale)
Pur di non ritornare a casa, dove vivono i sensi di colpa
Ho preferito lasciarli da soli
Come si fa coi genitori quando si cresce
Per poi trovarsi alle cinque tra gli zombie al Carrefour
Ora che dovrei essere fuori a festeggiare (Yeh)
A urlare come fanno i ragazzi
Mi andrebbe bene anche vomitare
E imparare a lasciare o a essere lasciati
A perdonare tutto, ad asciugare il male
Con un amico buono come il pane
Col prosciutto
Ho sentito soltanto il bisogno di fare (Eh)
Qualcosa di buono, qualcosa di normale (Normale)
Pur di non ritornare a casa, dove vivono i sensi di colpa
Ho preferito lasciarli da soli
Come si fa coi ricordi peggiori quando si cresce
Perché fare la spesa a me fa stare bene
Perché mi fa pensare a quando la facevamo insieme (Insieme)
Perché ora che stai meglio, sento che mi devo prendere un po' più cura di me
Sempre che ci riesco
Adesso pago ed esco
Fuori c'è un'alba splendida

Just let me die 'cause I can't take
Living with what's in my head
If I surrender, surrender
To the monsters in me
If I surrender, surrender
To the monsters in me
What's the point of holding on like this?
When no one seems to care if I exist
There is no agony like being strong when no one knows you're sick
So sick of hearing I should stay when I know I would never be missed
So let me fall, let me break
Under everything unsaid
Just let me die 'cause I can't take
Living with what's in my head
If I surrender, surrender
To the monsters in me
If I surrender, surrender
To the monsters in me
  If you could see under my skin
You'd realize why I hold it in
Why it's a fight I don't wanna win
  If you could see all my abuse
And spent a day inside my shoes
You'd realize why I just wanna lose
Will anyone believe the hell of being me
  Before I decide to be the dying proof?
So let me fall, let me break
Under everything unsaid
Just let me die 'cause I can't take
Living with what's in my head
If I surrender, surrender
To the monsters in me
If I surrender, surrender
To the monsters in me

Keeps my feet on the ground when I get too high

A life spent talking when my epitaph would do
Wasting my days with my mind on the future
And my past like a chain that won’t ever let me go
Where would I go, and would a lone soul miss me?
If I leave in the night I'll only be running
With the weight of the world at the tips of my fingers
A long lost soul in the wilderness alone
All of the joy I've known
The ways I've grown
The loves I've shown my heart to
I'm gonna get it together, oh-oh-oh
And live forever
And live forever
Day after day, oh, the world keeps turning
The stars in the sky above us keep burnin'
But it isn't for you, and it ain't for me neither
Try though I might, I was never a believer
Taking it slow, but it all goes quickly
The time that it takes is all I'll take with me
So, I'm saving it up just to go out and spend it
Gonna fly through my life till I crash into the ending
All of the joy I've known
The ways I've grown
The loves I've shown my heart to
I'm gonna get it together, oh-oh-oh
And live forever
I'll make a deal with the devil, oh-oh-oh
And live forever never knowing why
I don't know why

Increase my pace and hop the gate
And travel to another plane
First I'd find my evil twin
Then I will make best friends with it
We'd both hate the same things
And waste some hours talking shit
We could write some songs
Joel would be impressed
We complete each other's lines
Because our stupid brains connect
But because that
Our serotonin would crash
At approximately the same time
And we both would need a nap

Nirvana, but it's far away

And parachutes for my escape
Jump face-first into the sun
We’ve got the same sunglasses on
My solar eyes grow polarized
But the blinding light is so much fun
Maybe paradise
Is somewhere deep inside
The halls or walls
Where I've spent all my time
Building my whole life
Where I feel alright
‘Cause I never wanna leave the secret life of me

I don’t wanna see your face again
And I can find me someone new
But all I want is to be with you
I can learn how to let you go
And carry on with the one man show
I’ll fade away into the blue
But all I want is to be with you
   All I want is to be with you
I’ll get dressed and hit the town tonight
And meet some faces under neon lights
I dance alone with deja-vu
But all I want is to be with you
All I want is to be with you
They said I’d hurt you, said I’d run
Just like I always do with everyone
But you were different and I was true
And all I want is to be with you
All I want is to be with you
All I want is to be with you
All I want is
All I want is
All I want is
All I want is
All I want is

46,Delicious Things,Wolf Alice,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/wolf-alice/delicious-things-chords-3738035," Could I belong here, the vibes are kinda strong here
The vibes are kinda wrong here, scared to know just what goes on here
 Some guy has taken me into his garden
It seems to be some kind of mountain
 I'm socially anxious and a long way from home
I've only just learnt my margarita from mojito, so
 Could I belong here, the vibes are kinda strong here
Ask me if I'm from here and I won't say no
Ahh, aaaah, aaah, I won't say no, I'll give it a go
Ohh, ooooh, oooh, I won't say no, I'll give it a
Shot for the spot at the top
A girl like mе, would you believe I'm in Los Angеles?
This guy asks me where my home is, I say I don't know it's
Probably where the boy I love and left all on his own is
 He rolls his eyes and cuts a selfish line of blow
He was here for one thing, of he can't get it then he'll go but
 I don't care, I'm in the Hollywood Hills
I'm no longer pulling pints, I'm no longer cashing tills
And I'm alive, I feel like Marilyn Monroe
If you're all poppin' pills, you know I won't say no
Ahh, aaaah, aaah, I won't say no, I'll give it a go
Ohh, ooooh, oooh, I won't say no, I'll give it a
Shot for the spot at the top
A girl like mе, would you believe I'm in Los Angеles?
Don't lose sight
Don't lose sight
The guy from the garden, I think his name is Adam
He's in bed here beside me, though I think he is a bad man
 He like the fact that I play music in a band
He is making a movie and the score needs a hand
 Feel like I'm falling, dreams slowly stalling
 Extravagance disguised as elegance is boring
 I don't belong here, though it really is quite fun here
""Hey, is mum there? It's just me, I felt like calling""
Ahh, aaaah, aaah, I won't say no, I'll give it a go
Ohh, ooooh, oooh, I won't say no, I'll give it a
Shot for the spot at the top

47,Sempre Bene,Frah Quintale,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/frah-quintale/sempre-bene-chords-3738185,"Io e te, mhm
Ci siamo tolti tutto
Ancora prima di levarci i vestiti
Sincronizzati come i nostri respiri
Trattieni il fiato finché siamo sul fondo
Io e te, mhm-mh
Così lontani che ho il cielo di un altro colore
La stessa strada può avere anche più traiettorie
Tu non cambiare direzione
Magari ci ritroveremo nello stesso posto
Sai che gli oggetti allo specchio sono sempre al rovescio
E non capisco se sto sorridendo
Però stasera esco e tu farai lo stesso, ma non sarà lo stesso
Se il mondo girerà anche sеnza noi
Ricordami di stare sempre bеne anche senza te
Ricordati di stare sempre bene anche senza me
Io e te, mhm-mhm
Ci siamo messi insieme e poi siamo caduti in pezzi
Sul collo hai ancora i segni dei miei denti
Io nella schiena ho ancora i tuoi coltelli
Chissà oggi tu come ti senti, come ti senti?
Io te, mhm-mhm
Così sbagliati che insieme era la perfezione
Ma a volte il male può fare il giro intero delle cose
Lasciare un po' di pace quando se ne va l'amore
Sai che gli oggetti allo specchio sono sempre al rovescio
E non capisco se sto sorridendo
Però stasera esco e tu farai lo stesso, ma non sarà lo stesso
Se il mondo girerà anche sеnza noi
Ricordami di stare sempre bеne anche senza te
Ricordati di stare sempre bene anche senza me
Ricordami di stare sempre bеne anche senza te
Ricordati di stare sempre bene anche senza me
Sarà difficile
Restare soli a volte
Prova a sorridere, eh
Se il mondo girerà anche senza noi
Ricordami di stare sempre bene anche senza te
Mhm-mhm-mhm-mhm
Ricordami di stare sempre bene
Ricordati di stare sempre bene

But I don't wanna let go
Maybe if I just do what you want
Then you'll leave me alone
It feels like you're taking me home
But every other day I see another bone
I hate your guts
But I'll meet you same time, same place tomorrow
An archaeology excavation on my body
And I'm brushing so gently
They're tryna cover up the bones underneath
No matter what I do I feel guilty
Crossing all my fingers and toes
That I don't wake up again in a black hole
She said she would send me back homе to decide
If I wanna die miserable
Doctor, I'm not doing too well
If this shit was a choice I wouldn't need your help
I see the world through the eyes of a dog
but I can't see yellow
An archaeology excavation on my body
And I'm brushing so gently
They're tryna cover up the bones underneath
No matter what I do I feel guilty
Man's best friend's on first name terms with God
I thought I could fake it but I'm not
I'm a scarecrow in someone else’s garden
An archaeology excavation on my body
And I'm brushing so gently
They're tryna cover up the bones underneath
No matter what I do I feel guilty
No matter what I do I feel guilty

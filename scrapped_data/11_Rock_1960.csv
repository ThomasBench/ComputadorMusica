0,Desolation Row (ver 3),Bob Dylan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bob-dylan/desolation-row-chords-1092234,"They're selling postcards of the hanging,
they're painting the passports brown;
the beauty parlor is filled with sailors,
the circus is in town
they've got him in a trance;
one hand is tied to the tight-rope walker,
the other is in his pants
And the riot squad they're restless,
they need somewhere to go;
as lady and I look out tonight,
from Desolation Row
Cinderella, she seems so easy,
""it takes one to know one,"" she smiles;
and puts her hands in her back pockets,
Bette Davis style
""you belong to me I believe"";
and someone says,"" you're in the wrong place, my friend,
you better leave""
And the only sound that's left,
after the ambulances go;
is Cinderella sweeping up,
on Desolation Row
Now the moon is almost hidden,
the stars are beginning to hide;
the fortunetelling lady,
has even taken all her things inside
and the hunchback of Notre Dame;
everybody is making love,
or else expecting rain
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing,
he's getting ready for the show;
he's going to the carnival tonight,
on Desolation Row
Now Ophelia, she's 'neath the window,
for her I feel so afraid;
on her twenty-second birthday,
she already is an old maid
she wears an iron vest;
her profession's her religion,
her sin is her lifelessness
And though her eyes are fixed upon,
Noah's great rainbow;
she spends her time peeking,
into Desolation Row
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
With his friend, a jealous monk
As he bummed a cigarette
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet
Now you would not think to look at him
But he was famous long ago
For playing the electric violin
On Desolation Row
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
Inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients
They're trying to blow it up
She's in charge of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps the cards that read
""Have Mercy on His Soul""
They all play on penny whistles
You can hear them blow
If you lean your head out far enough
From Desolation Row
Across the street they've nailed the curtains
They're getting ready for the feast
The Phantom of the Opera
A perfect image of a priest
To get him to feel more assured
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence
After poisoning him with words
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls
""Get Outa Here If You Don't Know
Casanova is just being punished for going
To Desolation Row""
Now at midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
Where the heart-attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row
Praise be to Nero's Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
And everybody's shouting
""Which Side Are You On?""
Fighting in the captain's tower
While calypso singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers
Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much
About Desolation Row
Yes, I received your letter yesterday
(About the time the door knob broke)
When you asked how I was doing
Was that some kind of joke?
Yes, I know them, they're quite lame
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name
Right now I can't read too good
Don't send me no more letters no
Not unless you mail them
From Desolation Row

1,Like A Rolling Stone (ver 2),Bob Dylan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bob-dylan/like-a-rolling-stone-chords-661966,"Once upon a time you dressed so fine
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
 People'd call, say, ""Beware doll,
you're bound to fall"" you thought they were all.. kiddin' you
 You used to.. laugh about
 Everybody that was.. hangin' out
 Now you don't..  talk so loud
 Now you don't..  seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal.
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
Aww, You've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get.. juiced in it
Nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
And now you're gonna have to get.. used to it
 You said you'd never compromise
 With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
 He's not selling any alibis
 As you stare into the vacuum   of his eyes
And say do you want to make a deal?
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
Aww, You never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did.. tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your.. kicks for you
 You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat
 Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
 Ain't it hard when you discover that
 He really wasn't  where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal.
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
Aww, Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they.. got it made
 Exchanging all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring,  you'd better pawn it babe
 You used to be so amused
 At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
 Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
 When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose
 You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.
How does it feel
How does it feel
To be on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone

A fortress deep and mighty,

I have no need of friendship; friendship causes pain.
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain.

It's sleeping in my memory.

And my poetry to protect me;
I am shielded in my armor,
Hiding in my room, safe within my womb.

Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together
I've got some real-estate here in my bag
So we bought a pack of cigarettes, and Mrs. Wagner pies
And walked off to look for America
Cathy I said as we boarded the Greyhound in Pittsburg
Michigan seems like a dream to me now
It took me four days to hitch-hike from Saginaw
And I've come to look for America
Laughing on the bus, playing games with the faces
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
I said be careful his bowtie is really a camera
Toss me a cigarette I think there's one in my raincoat
We smoked the last one an hour ago
So I looked at the scenery, she read her magazine
And the moon rose over an open field
Cathy I'm lost, I said, though I knew she was sleeping
I'm empty and aching and I don't know why
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike

And the first one of the year
Lord Darnell's wife came into the church
The gospel for to hear
And when the meeting it was done
She cast her eyes about
And there she saw little Matty Groves
Walking in the crowd
""Come home with me, little Matty Groves
Come home with me tonight
Come home with me, little Matty Groves
And sleep with me 'til light""
""Oh, I can't come home, I won't come home
And sleep with you tonight
By the rings on your fingers I can tell
You are Lord Darnell's wife""
""But if I am Lord Darnell's wife
Lord Darnell's not at home
He is out in the far cornfields
Bringing the yearlings home""
And a servant who was standing by
And hearing what was said
He swore Lord Darnell he would know
Before the sun would set
And in his hurry to carry the news
He bent his breast and ran
And when he came to the broad mill stream
He took off his shoes and swam
Little Matty Groves, he lay down
And took a little sleep
When he awoke Lord Darnell
Was standing at his feet
Saying ""How do you like my feather bed
And how do you like my sheets
How do you like my lady
Who lies in your arms asleep?""
""Oh well, I like your feather bed
And well, I like your sheets
But better I like your lady gay
Who lies in my arms asleep""
""Well, get up, get up"", Lord Darnell cried
""Get up as quick as you can
It'll never be said in fair England
I slew a naked man""
""Oh I can't get up, I won't get up
I can't get up for my life
For you have two long beaten swords
And I not a pocket knife""
""Well it's true I have two beaten swords
They cost me deep in the purse
But you will have the better of them
And I will have the worse""
""And you will strike the very first blow
And strike it like a man
I will strike the very next blow
And I'll kill you if I can""
So Matty struck the very first blow
And he hurt Lord Darnell sore
Lord Darnell struck the very next blow
And Matty struck no more
And then Lord Darnell he took his wife
And he sat her on his knee
Saying, ""Who do like the best of us
Matty Groves or me?""
And then up spoke his own dear wife
Never heard to speak so free
""I'd rather a kiss from dead Matty's lips
Than you and your finery""
Lord Darnell he jumped up
And loudly he did bawl
He stuck his wife right through the heart
And pinned her against the wall
""A grave, a grave"", Lord Darnell cried
""To put these lovers in
But bury my lady at the top
For she was of noble kin""

In and out of the garden he goes,
Country garden in the wind and the rain,
Wherever he goes the people all complain.
Did Stephen prospered in his time?
Well he may and he may decline.
Did it matter, does it now?
Stephen would answer if he only knew how.
Wishing well with a golden bell,
Bucket hanging clear to hell,
Hell halfway twixt now and then,
Stephen fill it up and lower down and lower down again.
Lady finger, dipped in moonlight,
Writing ""What for?"" across the morning sky.
Sunlight splatters, dawn with answer,
Darkness shrugs and bids the day goodbye.
Speeding arrow, sharp and narrow,
What a lot of fleeting matters you have spurned.
Several seasons  with their treasons,
Wrap the babe in scarlet colors, call it your own.
Did he doubt or did he try?
Answers aplenty in the bye and bye,
Talk about your plenty, talk about your ills,
One man gathers what another man spills.
Saint Stephen will remain,
All he's lost he shall regain,
Seashore washed by the suds and foam,
Been here so long, he's got to calling it home.
Fortune comes a crawlin', calliope woman,
Spinnin' that curious sense of your own.
Can you answer? Yes I can.
But what would be the answer to the answer man?

 hold me darling for a little while
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss;
I found a love, that I knew I would miss

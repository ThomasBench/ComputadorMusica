All that is gold, is rusted
No one will know
Seasons cease, to change, and..
How far we've gone
How far were going
So here and the now
And the love for the sound
Are the moments that keep us moving
Waves crash along
Battered lonely lighthouse
Tomorrow shes gone
And if not, someday somehow
All these hands a waste
Well this side of, mortality is
Scaring, me, to death
To death
Don't think about it at all
Just keep your head low
Don't think about it at all
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

Under branches lit up by the moon
Posing our questions to owl and Eyore
As our days disappeared all to soon
But I wandered much further today than I should
And I can't seem to find my way back to the wood
So help me if you can I've got to get
Back to the house at Pooh corner by one
You'd be surprised there's so much to be done
Count all the bees in the hive, chase all the clouds from the sky
Back to the days of Christopher Robin and Pooh
Winnie the Pooh doesn't know what to do
Got a honey jar stuck on his nose
So he came to me asking for help and advice
And from here no one knows where he goes
So I sent him to ask of the owl if he's there
How to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear
So help me if you can I've got to get

top marks for not tryin'
So kind of you to bless us
With your effortlessness
We're grateful and so strangely comforted
And I wonder,
are you puttin' us under?
Cause we can't take our eyes off
The t-shirt and ties combination
Well see you later, innovator
Some want to kiss, some want to kick you
There's not a net you couldn't slip through
Or at least that's the impression I get
Cause you're smooth and you're wet
And she's not aware yet, but she's yours
She'll be sayin' ""Use me,______________
Show me the jacuzzi""
I imagine that it's there on a plate
Your rendezvous rate means that you'll never be frightened
To make them wait for a while
I doubt it's your style________
Not to get what you set out to acquire
You are the unforecasted storm

If her hair was still red.

Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.

Rain fallin' on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast

Tangled up in blue.

As the evening sky grew dark,
She looked at him and he felt a spark
tingle to his bones.
'Twas then he felt alone
and wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate
 Our conversation  was short and sweet
 It nearly swept me  off-a my feet.
And I'm back in the rain, oh
And you are on dry land,
You made it there somehow
  You're a big girl now.
Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press
Whoever it is I wish they'd cut it out quick but when they will I can only
guess.
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,
She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me.
I can't help it if I'm lucky.

Blowing down the backroads headin' south.

You're an idiot, babe.

If you see her say hello, she might be in North Saigon
She left here in a hurry; I don't know what she was on

When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form.

23,Remember The Mountain Bed,Wilco,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/wilco/remember-the-mountain-bed-chords-1242713,"Do you still sing of the mountain bed we made of limbs and leaves?
Do you still sigh there near the sky where the holly berry bleeds?
You laughed as I covered you over with leaves
Face, breast, hips and thighs
You smiled when I said the leaves were just the color of your eyes
Rosin smells and turpentine smells from eucalyptus and pine
Bitter tastes of twigs we chewed where tangled woodbines twine
Trees held us in on all four sides
So thick we could not see
I could not see any wrong in you, and you saw none in me
Your arm was brown against the ground, your cheeks part of the sky
Your fingers played with grassy moss, as limber you did lie
Your stomach moved beneath your shirt
And your knees were in the air
Your feet played games with mountain roots as you lay thinking there
Below us the trees grew clumps of trees raised families of trees, and they
As proud as we tossed their heads in the wind and flung good seeds away
The sun was hot and the sun was bright
Down in the valley below
Where people starved and hungry for life so empty come and go
There in the shade and hid from the sun we freed our minds and learned
Our greatest reason for being here, our bodies moved and burned
There on our mountain bed of leaves
We learned life's reason why
People laugh and love and dream, they fight and they hate to die
The smell of your hair I know is still there, if most of our leaves are blown
Our words still ring in the brush and the trees where singing seeds are sown
Your shape and form is dim, but plain
There on our mountain bed
I see my life was brightest where you laughed and laid your head
I learned the reason why man must work and how to dream big dreams
To conquer time and space and fight the rivers and the seas
I stand here filled with my emptiness now
And look at city and land
I know why farms and cities are built by hot warm nervous hands
I've crossed many states just to stand here now, my face all hot with tears
I've crossed city and valley, desert and stream to bring my body here
My history and future blaze bright in me
And all my joy and pain
Go through my head on our mountain bed where I smell your hair again
All this day long I linger here and on in through the night
My greeds, my joys, my cravings, hopes, my dreams inside me fight
My loneliness healed, my emptiness filled
I walk above all pain
Back to the breast of my woman and child to scatter my seeds again...

And I know I'm so pathetic
I wouldn't move to save my life
They tell me that you're lonely
It's no surprise, when you walk around all day
Wearing those lonely, lonely, lonely
Well, I try to tell you jokes
I'm afraid you'd cry
And if you need a little sunshine
You can borrow some of mine
It's okay if you're unhappy
I would say before I leave her
Just take a look around
There's no one here that's happy either
Lonely girl, you are my world
And I could be anything you need
And if for some reason you don't feel like talking
I could just sit and enjoy your company
The days keep going by
And it doesn't get much better
You could be threatening to jump
And all of your friends would just scream
""Let her!""

'Cause it has always been that way
But on the one day they close early
That's the one you want to stay

Making my way down town
Walking fast
Faces pass
And I'm home bound
Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making a way
Through the crowd
         And I still need you
         And I still miss you
         And now I wonder
If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by
Cause you know I'd 
walk a thousand miles
If I could just 
see   you ohhh
If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by
Cause you know I'd 
walk a thousand miles
If I could just 
see   you 
If I could just 
hold  you tonight

48,Existentialism On Prom Night,Straylight Run,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/straylight-run/existentialism-on-prom-night-chords-141892," When the sun came up
 We were sleeping in 
Sunk inside our blan - kets 
Sprawled across the bed 
And we were drea - ming 
 There are moments when, when I know it and
 The world revolves around us
 And we're keeping it 
 Keeping it all going 
 This  delicate bal - ance 
 Vulnerable, all knowing
 Sing like you think no one's listening 
 You would kill for this, just a little bit, just a little bit, you would 
 Sing like you think no one's listening 
 You would kill for this, just a little bit, just a little bit, you would, you would...
 Sing me something soft 
 Sad and delicate 
 Or loud and out of key 
 Sing me anything 
 We're glad for what we've got 
 Done with what we've lost 
 Our whole lives laid out right in front of (us)
 Sing like you think no one's listening 
 You would kill for this, just a little bit, just a little bit, you would 
 Sing like you think no one's listening 
 You would kill for this, just a little bit, just a little bit, you would, you would...
 Sing me something soft 
 Sad and delicate 
 Or loud and out of key
 Sing me any - thing

49,Coffee God And Cigarettes,Mischief Brew,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/mischief-brew/coffee-god-and-cigarettes-chords-1787758,"I used to worship whiskey, now I only drink the lord
And I take my coffee, cream and seven sugars
Before we meet we stand out on the sidewalk as it pours
Swappin' one addiction for another
Coffee, God and cigarettes are all that I need
It's all that I need just to break this routine
Coffee, God and cigarettes are all that you need
It's all that you need just to be as free as meeeeeeee...eee/eee
When I run into my old friends still drinkin' from that cup
I never stay too long as I've been tempted
I say you know drink the devils brew, you know it's just a crutch
No longer must you live your life dependent
Coffee, God and cigarettes are all that I need
It's all that I need just to break this routine
Coffee, God and cigarettes are all that you need
It's all that you need just to be as free as meeeeeee...eee/eee
Now what made me give, turn off the road that ends at the cliff
Took the car out for a spin, crashed the party, blood runs thin
Was it wakin up with fifty stitches in my gourd
Was it dreamin' about bourbon in the trauma ward
Well I knew I was surely gonna end up dead
If I didn't embrace coffee, God and ciga..rettes...(pause)
Coffee, God and cigarettes are all that I need
It's all that I need just to break this routine
Coffee, God and cigarettes are all that you need
It's all that you need just to be as free as meeeeeeee...eee/eee

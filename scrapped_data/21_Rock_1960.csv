bad dreams, he worries..
Did he hear a good-bye, or even hel..lo?

They are three together, they are four for each other.
Stand by the stairway, you'll see something
certain to tell you, confusion has its cost.

saying.. she is lost and choking on hel..lo.

 Tin can at my feet; think I'll kick it down the street.

To help the  needy, and show them the way.

   As the ceiling flew away 
   When we called out for another drink 
   The waiter brought a tray.
   And so it was that later 
   As the miller told his tale 
   That her face, at first just ghostly, 
   Turned a whiter shade of pale.
   She said, ""I'm home on a shore leave,""
   Though in truth waved at sea
   So I took her by the looking glass
   Would not let her berathe, 
   Saying, ""You must be the mermaid
   That took Neptune for a ride.""
   She smiled at me so sadly
   That my anger straightway died.
   And so it was that later 
   As the miller told his tale 
   That her face, at first just ghostly, 
   Turned a whiter shade of pale. 
   She said, ""There is no reason 
   And the truth is plain to see."" 
   But I wandered through my playing cards 
   And would not let her be 
   One of sixteen vestal virgins 
   Who were leaving for the coast 
   And although my eyes were open
   They might have just as well been closed. 
   And so it was that later 
   As the miller told his tale 
   That her face, at first just ghostly, 
   Turned a whiter shade of pale.
   If music be the food of love
   Then laughter is it's queen
   And likewise if behind is in front
   Then dirt in truth is clean
   My mouth by then like cardboard
   Seemed to slip straight through my head
   So we crash dived straightway quickly
   And attacked the ocean bed.
   And so it was that later 
   As the miller told his tale 
   That her face, at first just ghostly, 
   Turned a whiter shade of pale.

He met with a raven with eyes black as coals
And shortly they were a-talking
""Your future, your future, I would tell to you
Your future, you often have asked me
Your true love will die by your own right hand
And Crazy Man Michael will cursed be""
Michael he ranted and Michael he raved
And beat at the four winds with his fists-oh
He laughed and he cried, he shouted and he swore
For his mad mind had trapped him with a kiss-oh
""You speak with an evil, you speak with a hate
You speak for the devil that haunts me
For is she not the fairest in all the broad land?
Your sorceror's words are to taunt me""
He took out his dagger of fire and of steel
And struck down the raven through the heart-oh
The bird fluttered long and the sky it did spin
And the cold earth did wonder and start-oh
""Oh, where is the raven that I struck down dead
That here'd lie here on the ground-oh?
I see but my true love with a wound so red""
Her lover's heart it did pound-oh
Crazy Man Michael, he wanders and walks
But his eyes they are sane and his speech it is clear
And he longs to be far away-oh
Michael he whistles the simplest of tunes
And asks the wild woods their pardon
For his true love is flown into every flower grown
And he must be keeper of the garden

Fruwały za mną jasne anioły.

Nieśmiertelnik żółty - październik.

Od mimozy złotej - majowy.

Zasypiałem z nim gasnącym o poranku, 
W snach dawnymi bawiąc się wiosnami,

People carry roses,
And make promises by the hours,
My love she laughs like the flowers,
Valentines can't buy her.
In the dime stores and bus stations,
People talk of situations,
Read books, repeat quotations,
Draw conclusions on the wall.
Some speak of the future,

She knows there's no success like failure
And that failure's no success at all.
The cloak and dagger dangles,
Madams light the candles.
In ceremonies of the horsemen,
Even the pawn must hold a grudge.
Statues made of match sticks,
Crumble into one another,
My love winks, she does not bother,
She knows too much to argue or to judge.
The bridge at midnight trembles, 
The country doctor rambles,
Bankers' nieces seek perfection,
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring.
The wind howls like a hammer,
The night blows cold and rainy,
My love she's like some raven
At my window with a broken wing.

Protected by a silver spoon.
But now she sucks her thumb and wonders,
By the banks of her own lagoon.
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she th-ought I knew the answer
Well, I knew but I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got my-self a proper job
And though she th-ought I knew the answer
She could steal, but she could not rob
Didn't anybody t-t-tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me, oh yeah.

	In the morning we arise and
	Start the day the same old way
	As yesterday the day before and
	All in all it's just a day like
	All the rest so do your best with
	Chewing gum and it is oh so
	Repetitious
	Waiting on the sun
	/ / / /  / / / /  / / / /  / / / /
	I feel shivers in my spine
	When the iceman says his ice is melting
	Won't be there on time
	Hope he finds a rhyme
	For his little mind
	I can see you
	  With no (hands)
	Eyes I need you
	   You're my (heart)

Maybe I should have called you first
But I was dying to get to you
I was dreaming while I drove
The long straight road ahead, uh-huh, yeah
Could taste your sweet kisses, your arms open wide
This fever for you is just burning me up inside
I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright?
I drove all night, crept in your room
Woke you from your sleep to make love to you
Is that alright? I drove all night
What in this world keeps us from falling apart?
No matter where I go I hear the beating of our one heart
I think about you when the night is cold and dark
No one can move me the way that you do
Nothing erases the feeling between me and you
I drove all night to get to you
Is that alright?

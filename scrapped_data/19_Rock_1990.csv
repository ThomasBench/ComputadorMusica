0,Distant Sun,Crowded House,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/crowded-house/distant-sun-chords-65364,"Tell me all the things you would change
I don't pretend to know what you want
When you come around and spin my top
Time and again, time and again
No fire where I lit my spark
I am not afraid of the dark
Where your words devour my heart
And put me to shame, put me to shame
Your seven worlds collide
Whenever I am by your side
Dust from a distant sun
Will shower over everyone
You're still so young to travel so far
Old enough to know who you are
Wise enough to carry the scars
Without any blame, there's no-one to blame
It's easy to forget what you learnt
Waiting for the thrill to return
Feeling your desire burn
And drawn to the flame
Your seven worlds collide
Whenever I am by your side
Dust from a distant sun
Will shower over everyone
Dust from a distant sun
Will shower over everyone
And I'm lying on the table washed out in the flood
Like a Christian fearing vengeance from above
I don't pretend to know what you want
Your seven worlds collide
Whenever I am by your side
Dust from a distant sun
Will shower over everyone
As time slips by

1,Harvest Moon Album,Neil Young,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/neil-young/harvest-moon-chords-73," She used to work in a diner, never saw a woman look finer
 I used to order just to see her float across the floor.
 She grew up in a small town, never put her roots down.
 Daddy kept movin so she did too.
 Somewhere on a desert highway, she rides a Harley Davidson
 Her long blonde hair flyin' in the wind.
 She's been runnin half of her life.
 The chrome and steel she rides,
 Collidin' with the very air she breathes, the air she breathes.
>From Hank to Hendrix, I walked these streets with you.
Here I am with this old guitar, doing what I do.
I always expected, that you would see me through.
I never believed in much, but I believed in you.
Can we get it together, can we still stand side by side.
Can we make it last, like a musical ride?
 Open up and let the light back in
 Open up and let the light back in
 I was thinkin' of you and me
 Making love beneath the tree
 And now I wonder could it be 
 Thinkin' 'bout the times we had
 Some were good and some were bad
 Guitar fightin' the T.V. 
 I was thinkin' bout you and me-e                   (x2)
 I was thinkin' of you and me-e
 I was thinkin' bout you and me-e

      But there's a full moon risin'
      Let's go dancing in the light
      We know where the music's playin'
      Because I'm still in love with you
      I want to see you dance again
      Because I'm still in love with you
 The little creatures run in from the cold, back to the nest just like
 the days of old.  There in the safety of a mother's arms  the warmth
 of ages far away from harm again.   
 No one wins, it's a war of man.            ( repeat like the recording)

 One of these days I'm going to sit down and write a long letter
 to all the good friends I've known.
 And I'm goin' to try to thank them all for the good times together
 though so apart we've grown.
 One of these days I'm going to sit down and write a long letter
 to all the good friends I've known.
 One of these days, One of these days, One of these days
 And it won't be long It won't be long.

 And it won't be long It won't be long.

With a loaded gun and sweet dreams of you.

On the roller coaster ride
that my emotions have to take me on
I heard a newborn baby cry     through the night 
I heard a perfect echo die
Into an anonymous wall of digital sound

You had so much and now so much is gone
What are you gonna do        with your life?
What a lucky man
to see the earth before it touched his hand
What an angry fool      to condemn        
One more night to go
One more sleep upon your burning banks
A greedy man  never knows      what he's done

Went to the rodeo today
I saw the cowgirls lined up on the fence
A brand new Chevrolet               A brand new pair of seamless pants
We watched the moment of defeat
Played back over on the video screen

A natural beauty should be       preserved      like a monument

Let's go dancing in the light
We know where the music's playing
Let's go out and feel the night.
Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon.
When we were strangers
I watched you from afar
When we were lovers
I loved you with all my heart.
But now it's getting late
And the moon is climbing high
I want to celebrate
See it shining in your eye.
Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again

   El juro y que volveria y empapada en llanto ella juro que esperaria
   Miles de lunas pasaron y siempre ella estaba en el muelle esperando
   Muchas tardes se anidaron se anidaron en su pelo y en sus labios.
   Llevaba el mismo vestido y por si el volviera no se fuera a equivocar
   Los cangrejos le mordian sus ropajes, su tristeza y su ilusion
   Y el tiempo se escurrio y sus ojos se le llenaron de amaneceres
   Y del mar se enamoro y su cuerpo se enrraizo en el muelle.
          Sola, sola, en el olvido. Sola, sola, con su espiritu
          Sola, sola, con su amor. Sola, en el muelle de San Blas.
   Su cabello se blanqueo pero ningun barco a su amor le devolvia
   Y en el pueblo le decian, le decian la loca del muelle de San Blas
   Y una tarde de abril la trataron transladar al manicomio
   Nadie la pudo arrancar y del mar nunca jamas la separaron.
      Sola. sola en el olvido. Sola, sola con su espiritu.
      Sola, sola con el sol y el mar. Sola
      Sola, sola en el olvido, Sola, sola con su espiritu.
      Sola, sola con su amor el mar. Sola, en el muelle de San Blas.
      Se quedo, se quedo, sola, sola.

      Se quedo ahi, se quedo hasta el fin.
      Se quedo ahi, se quedo, en el muelle de San Blas

They never know it
Because you never show it
You always get your way
They never know it
Because you never show it
You always get your way
Have you and her been taking pictures of your obsessions?
Because I met a boy who went through one of your sessions
In his blue velour and silk
You liberated
A boy I never rated
And now he's throwing discus
For Liverpool and Widnes
You liberated
A boy I never rated
And now he's doing... business
The stars of track and field, you are
The stars of track and field are beautiful people
Could I write a piece about you now that you've made it?
About the hours spent, the wilderness in your training
You only did it so that you could wear
Your terry underwear
And feel the city air
Run past your body                   
Your terry underwear
And feel the city air
Run past your body
Could I write a requiem for you when you're dead?
""She had the moves, she had the speed, it went to her head""
She never needed anyone
to get her round the track
But when she's on her back
She had the knowledge
To get her into college

She had the knowledge
To get her what she wanted

I smell your skin on the

Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here,
We was hitchhikin' down a long and lonesome road.
All of a sudden, there shined a shiny demon...
In the middle of the road.
And he said:
Well me and Kyle, we looked at each other,
And we each said...   ""Okay""
And we played the first thing that came to our heads,
Just so happened to be,
The Best Song in the World, it was The Best Song in the World.
Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
One and one make two, two and one make three,
It was destiny.
Once every hundred-thousand years or so,
When the sun doth shine and the moon doth glow
And the grass don't grow...
Needless to say, the beast was stunned.
Whip-crack went his schwumpy tail,
And the beast was done.
He asked us: ""Be you angels?""
And we said, ""Nay. We are but men!""
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh-ah-ah,
Ohhh, whoah, ah-whoah-oh!
This is not The Greatest Song in the World.
No, this is just a tribute.
Couldn't remember The Greatest Song in the World.
No, this is a tribute, oh.
   To The Greatest Song in the World, All right!
   It was The Greatest Song in the World, All right!
It was the best muthafuckin' song
The greatest song in the world.
And the peculiar thing is this my friends:
The song we sang on that fateful night,
It didn't actually sound anything like this song.
This is just a tribute! You gotta' believe me!
And I wish you were there! Just a matter of opinion.
Ah, fuck! Good God, God lovin',
So surprised to find you can't stop it.
            All right!          All right!

In questo girotondo d'anime
chi si volta è perso e resta qua
lo so per certo amico
mi son voltato anch'io
e per raggiungerti ho dovuto correre.
Ma più mi guardo in giro e vedo che
c'è un mondo che va avanti anche se
se tu non ci sei più
se tu non ci sei più.
E dimmi perché
in questo girotondo d' anime non c'è
un posto per scrollarsi via di dosso
quello che ci è stato detto e
quello che oramai si sa
C'è che C'è,
c'è che prendo un treno che va
a paradiso città
e vi saluto a tutti e salto su
prendo il treno e non ci penso più.

senza ritorno se non in volo
senza fermate nè confini

0,Sugar Magnolia,Grateful Dead,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/grateful-dead/sugar-magnolia-chords-12368,"Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming,
heads all empty and I don't care.
Saw my baby down by the river,
  Knew she had to come up soon for air.
Sweet blossom come on, under the willow,
We can have high times if you'll abide,
We can discover the wonders of nature,
Rollin' in the rushes down by the river side.
She's got everything delightful, she's got everything I need,
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double, pays my ticket when I speed.
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet,
  She can wade in a drop of dew.
She don't come and I don't follow,
Waits backstage while I sing to you.
She can dance a cajun rhythm,
Jump like a willys in four-wheel drive.
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter,
She can make happy any man alive.
Sugar magnolia,   ringing that bluebell,
Caught up in sunlight,
Come on out singing I'll walk you in the sunshine,
Come on honey, come along with me.
She's got everything delightful, she's got everything I need,
A breeze in the pines in the summer night moonlight,
crazy in the sunlight, yes indeed.
  Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying, when the moon is halfway down,
  Sometimes when the night is dying,
  I take me out and I wander around,   I wander ‘round.
   Sunshine daydream,    walking in the tall trees,
   Going where the wind goes,     blooming like a red rose,
breathing more freely,   Ride Out
singin', I'll walk you in the morning sunshine,
   sunshine daydream...

1,Youre In My Heart,Rod Stewart,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/rod-stewart/youre-in-my-heart-chords-1477832,"I didn't know what day it was when you walked into the room
I said hello unnoticed, you said goodbye too soon
Breezin' through the clientele, spinnin yarns that were so lyrical
I really must confess right here, that the attraction was purely physical
I took all those habits of yours, which in the beginning were hard to accept
Your fashion sense for Beardsley prints, I put down up to experience
The big bosomed lady with a Dutch accent, who tried to change my, point of view
Her ad-lib lines were well rehearsed, but my heart poured out for you
You're in my heart, you're in my soul, you'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend, you're in my soul
My love for you is immeasurable, my respect for you, immense
You're ageless, timeless, lace and fineness, you're beauty and elegance
You're a rhapsody, a comedy, you're a symphony and a play
You're every love song ever written, but honey what do you see in me?
You're in my heart, you're in my soul, you'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend, you're in my soul
You're an essay in glamour, please pardon the grammer, but you're every schoolboy's dream
You're Celtic united, but baby I've decided, you're the best team I've ever seen
And there have been, many affairs, many times I've thought to leave
But I bite my lip and turn around, cause you're the warmest thing I ever found
You're in my heart, you're in my soul, you'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend, you're in my soul
You're in my heart, you're in my soul, you'll be my breath should I grow old
You are my lover, you're my best friend, you're in my soul

and the feeling is laid back. 
Palm trees grow and rents are low but you know,  
I keep thinking about..making my way back. 
Well, I'm New York City born and raised, 
but nowadays I'm lost between two shores, 
L.A.'s fine but it ain't home, 
New York's home but it ain't mine no more. 
I am, I said, to no one there, 
and no one heard at all, not even the chair. 
I am, I cried, I am, said I, 
and I am lost and I can’t even say why...
leaving me lonely still. 
Did you ever hear about the frog who dreamed of 
being a king...and then became one? 
Well, except for the names and a few other changes, 
If you talk about me..the story's the same one. 
But I have an emptiness deep inside, and I tried, 
but it won't let me go, 
and I'm not a man who likes to swear, 
but I've never cared for the sound of being alone. 
I am, I said, to no one there, 
and no one heard at all, not even the chair. 
I am, I cried, I am, said I, 
and I am lost and I cant even say why...

Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans.
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
Rode us all the way to New Orleans.
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues.
Windshield wipers slappin' time, I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew.
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose,
Nothin' don't mean nothin' if it ain't free.
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues.
Feelin' good was good enough for me,
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee.
From the Kentucky coal mines to the California sun,
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul.
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done,
Hey, Bobby's body kept me from the cold.
One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away,
He's lookin' for that home and I hope he finds it.
But I'd trade all my tomorrows for one single yesterday,
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine.
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose,
And nothin' ain't worth nothin', but it's free.
And feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues,
And feelin' good was good enough for me
Oh, good enough for me and my Bobby McGee.

At ramblers, wild gamblers
That's all in the past
You call me a fool you say it's a crazy scheme
  This one's for real I already bought the dream
  So useless to  ask me why
Throw a kiss and say goodbye

   I'll play just what I feel
Drink scotch whiskey all night long
And  die      behind      the wheel

I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the crimson tide

  Sharing the things we know and love with those of my kind
Libations, sensations which stagger the mind
  I crawl like a viper through these suburban streets
  Make love to these women languid and bittersweet
  I'll rise when the sun goes down
  Cover every game in town
A world of my own
I'll make it my home sweet home

 Sue me if I play too long

Down by that highway side.
Everybody's going somewhere
Riding just as fast as they can ride.
I guess they've got a lot to do
Before they can rest assured their lives
Are justified.
Pray to God for me, Baby
He can let me slide.
Cause I've been up and down this highway
Far as my eyes can see.
No matter how fast I run
I can never seem to get away from me.
No matter where I am
I can't help feeling I'm just a day away
From where I want to be.
Now, I'm running home, Baby
Like a river to the sea.
Baby, if you can see me
Out across this wilderness
There's just one thing
I was hoping you might guess.
Baby, you can free me
All in the power of your sweet tenderness.
I can see it in your eyes
You've got those bright, baby blues.
You don't see what you've got to gain
But you don't like to lose.
You watch yourself from the sidelines
Like your life was a game you don't mind playing
To keep yourself amused.
I don't mean to be cruel, Baby
But you're looking confused.
It's so hard to come by that feeling of peace.
""Close your eyes, try a few of these.""
I thought I was flying like a bird
So far above my sorrow
But when I looked down
I was standing on my knees.
Now, I need someone to help me
Someone to help me, please.
Baby, if you need me
Like I know I need you.
There's just one thing
I'll ask you to do
Take my hand and lead me
To the hole in your garden wall
And pull me through.
Pull me through....

They waited there in line,
And when they got up on their feet
They made the show.
And that was sweet but I can hear the sound,
Of slamming doors and folding chairs.
And that s a sound they ll never know.
Now roll them cases out and lift them amps.
Haul them trusses down and get em up them ramps.
 Cause when it comes to movin me,
You know, you guys are the champs.
But when that last guitar s been packed away,
You know that I still want to play.
So just make sure you got it all set to go,
Before you come, for my piano.

And they re waiting to go.
We ve got to drive all night,
And do a show in Chicago.
Or Detroit, I don t know,
We do so many shows in a row.
And these towns all look the same.
We just pass the time in the hotel rooms,
And wander  round backstage.
Till those lights come up,
And we hear that crowd,
And we remember why we came.
Now, we got Country & Western on the bus, R & B.
We got Disco and 8-tracks,
And cassettes in stereo.
We've got rural scenes & magazines,
And we've got truckers on CB.
And we got Richard Pryor on the video.
We got time to think of the ones we love,
While the miles roll away.
But the only time that seems too short,
Is the time that we get to play.
People you've got the power,
Over what we do,
You can sit there and wait,
Or you can pull us through.
Come along, sing the song,
You know that you can't go wrong.
 Cause when that morning sun comes beatin down,
You're going to wake up in your town.

For the hearts that never played in tune
Like a lovely melody that everyone can sing
Take away the words that rhyme, it doesn't mean a thing

But where was June?           No it ne.....ver came around
     If it did, it never made a sound
Maybe I was absent or was listening too fast
Catching all the words but then the meaning going past

And I'd go a thousand times around the world just to be
Closer to her than to me

I loved her name.         Wished that I             had found a way
      And the reasons that would make her stay
I have learned to lead a life apart from all the rest
If I can't have the one I want, I'll do without the best
            Oh, how I miss the girl
And I'd go a million times around the world just to say
She had been mine for a day.

Laughing fit to burst upon each other

The fruit juice flowing slowly, slowly, slowly
Down the bronze of your body

We left our kin and all our friends back there in Tennessee
And I bought those one way tickets she had often begged me for
And they took us to the streets of Baltimore
Well her heart was filled with gladness when she saw those city lights
She said the prettiest place on earth was Baltimore at night
Well a man feels proud to give his woman what she's longing for
And I kind of like the Streets of Baltimore
Then I got myself a factory job, I ran an old machine
And I bought a little cottage in a neighborhood serene
And every night when I'd come home with every muscle sore
She'd drag me through the Streets of Baltimore
Well I did my best to bring her back to what she used to be
Then I soon learned she loved those bright lights more than she loved me
Now I'm a-going back on that same train that brought me here before
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore
While my baby walks the streets of Baltimore

As I reach for a peach
Slide a line down behind a sofa in San Tropez
Breaking a stick with a brick on the sand
Riding a wave in the wake of an old sedan
Sleeping alone in the drone of the darkness
Scratched by the sand that fell from my love
Deep in my dreams and I still hear her calling
If you're alone, I'll come home
Backward and homebound, the pigeon, the dove
Gone with the wind and the rain on an airplane
Born in a home with no silver spoon
I'm drinking champagne like a good tycoon
Sooner than wait for a break in the weather
I'll gather my far flung thoughts together
Speeding away on a wind to a new day
If you're alone, I'll come home
And I'll pause for a while by a country stile
And listen to the things they say
Digging for gold in a hole in my hand
Open the book, take a look at the way things stand
And you're leading me down to the place by the sea
I hear your soft voice calling to me
Making a date for later by phone
And if you're alone, I'll come home

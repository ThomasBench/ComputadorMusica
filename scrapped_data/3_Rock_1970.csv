Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinkin' that there was a
little more to life somewhere else
After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die tryin' she had one little promise she was gonna keep
O yeah, all right, take it easy, baby, make it last all night
She was an American girl
Well, it was kinda cold that night
She stood alone on the balcony
Yeah, she could hear the cars roll by
Out on 441 like waves crashin' on the beach
And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God it's so painful when something that's so close is still so far out of reach
O yeah, all right, take it easy, baby, make it last all night
She was an American girl

Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine.
Made up my mind to make a new start,
Going to california with an aching in my heart.
Someone told me theres a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.
Took my chances on a big jet plane,
Never let them tell you that theyre all the same.
The sea was red and the sky was grey,
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
As the children of the sun began to awake.
Seems that the wrath of the gods
I think I might be sinking.
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
Runs straight and high.
To find a queen without a king;
They say she plays guitar and cries as she sings.
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin to find a woman whos never, never, never been born.
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams,
Telling myself its not as hard, hard, hard as it seems.

Wake up Maggie I think I've got something to say to you
It's late September and I really should be back at school
I know I keep you amused But I feel I'm being used
Oh Maggie I couldn’t have tried any more
You led me away from home just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart, and that's what really hurts
The morning sun when it's in your face really shows your age
But that don't worry me none, in my eyes you're everything
I laughed at all your jokes, my love you didn't need to coax
Oh Maggie I couldn’t have tried any more
You led me away from home just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul that's a pain I can do without
All I needed was a friend to lend a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover and mother what a lover you wore me out
All you did was wreck my bed And in the morning kick me in the head
Oh Maggie I couldn’t have tried any more
You led me away from home 'cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart I couldn't leave you if I tried
I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool
Or find myself a rock and roll band that needs a helping hand
Oh Maggie, I wish I'd never seen your face
You made a first class fool out of me, but I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart but I love you anyway
Maggie, I wish I’d never seen your face
I’ll  get on back home, one of these days

34,Tangled Up In Blue,Bob Dylan,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/bob-dylan/tangled-up-in-blue-chords-456793,"Early one mornin' the sun was shinin',
I was layin' in bed
Wond'rin' if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red.
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was gonna be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.
And I was standin' on the side of the road
Rain fallin' on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues gettin' through,
Tangled up in blue.
She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess,
But I used a little too much force.
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best.
She turned around to look at me
As I was walkin' away
I heard her say over my shoulder,
""We'll meet again someday on the avenue,""
Tangled up in blue.
I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell.
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I happened to be employed
Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat
Right outside of Delacroix.
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind,
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew
Tangled up in blue.
She was workin' in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer,
I just kept lookin' at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear.
And later on as the crowd thinned out
I's just about to do the same,
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said to me, ""Don't I know your name?""
I muttered somethin' underneath my breath,
She studied the lines on my face.
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,
Tangled up in blue.
She lit a burner on the stove 
and offered me a pipe
""I thought you'd never say hello,"" she said
""You look like the silent type.""
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century.       
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burnin' coal
Pourin' off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you,
Tangled up in blue.
I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs,
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air.
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died.
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside.
And when finally the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn,
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew,
Tangled up in blue.
So now I'm goin' back again,
I got to get to her somehow.
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now.
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives.
Don't know how it all got started,
I don't know what they're doin' with their lives.
But me, I'm still on the road
Headin' for another joint
We always did feel the same,
We just saw it from a different point of view,
Tangled up in blue.

37,Cats In The Cradle,Harry Chapin,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/harry-chapin/cats-in-the-cradle-chords-407661,"A child arrived just the other day
He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch and bills to pay
  He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talkin 'fore I knew it and as he grew he'd say
I'm gonna be like you, dad
You know I'm gonna be like you
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you coming home Dad, I don't know when
But we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then.
My son turned ten just the other day
He said thanks for the ball dad, c'mon let's play
Can you teach me to throw, I said ""not today;  
I got a lot to do"", he said ""that's okay""
And he, he walked away but his smile never dimmed, he said
""I'm gonna be like him, yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him""
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you comin' home Dad, I don't know when
but we'll get together then
you know we'll have a good time then.
Well, he came home college just the other day
So much like a man, I just had to say
""Son I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?""
He shook his head and he said with a smile
""What I'd really like Dad is to borrow the car keys.
  See you later, can I have them please?""
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you comin' home son, I don't know when
We'll get together then Dad
You know we'll have a good time then.
I've long since retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I said ""I'd like to see you if you don't mind""
He said ""I'd love to dad if I could find the time""
You see, my new job's a hassle and the kid's have the flu
But it's sure nice talkin' to you dad
It's been sure nice talkin' to you
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me
My boy was just like me
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
When you comin' home son, I don't know when
We'll get together then Dad
You know we'll have a good time then.

Her long hair flowing in the midwinter wind
I know not how she found me for in darkness I was walking
And destruction lay around me from a fight I could not win
  Ah...  ahah.. ahahah...  ahahah
  Ah...  ahahah...  ahahah
She asked me name my foe then, I said the need within some men
To fight and kill their brothers without thought of love or God
And I begged her give me horses to trample down my enemies
So eager was my passion to devour this waste of life
  Ah...  ahah.. ahahah...  ahahah
  Ah...  ahahah...  ahahah
But she would not think of battle that reduces men to animals
So easy to begin and yet impossible to end
For she's the mother of our men who counselled me so wisely then
I feared to walk alone again and asked if she would stay
  Ah...  ahah.. ahahah...  ahahah
  Ah...  ahahah...  ahahah
Oh, lady lend your hand outright and let me rest here at your side
Have faith and trust in peace she said and filled my heart with life
There is no strength in numbers, have no such misconception
But when you need me be assured I won't be far away
  Ah...  ahah.. ahahah...  ahahah
  Ah...  ahahah...  ahahah
Thus having spoke she turned away and though I found no words to say
I stood and watched until I saw her black coat disappear
My labour is no easier but now I know I'm not alone
I find new heart each time I think upon that windy day
And if one day she comes to you drink deeply from her words so wise
Take courage from her as your prize and say hello from me

   There's talk on the street, it sounds so familiar;
  Great expectations, ev'rybody's watchin' you.
   People you meet they all seem to know you,
   even your old friends treat you like you're somethin' new.
    Johnny come lately,
    the new kid in town.
    Ev'rybody loves you,
    so don't let them down.
   You look in her eyes, the music begins to play,
   hopeless romantics, here we go again.
   But after a while you're lookin' the other  way,
it's those     restless hearts that never mend.             oohh ohh
   Johnny come lately,
   the new kid in town.
    Will she still love you
   when you're not around?

    There's so many things you should have told her,
But night after night you're willing to hold her,
just hold her, tears on your shoul - der.
   There's talk on the street, it's there to remind you.
   Doesn't really matter which side you're on.
   You're walkin' away and they're talkin' behind you,
they will never forget you 'til somebody new comes along.
     Where've you been lately?
    There's a new kid in town.
    Ev'rybody loves him (don't they?)
    And he's holdin' her and you're still 
a roou ou ou ound  oh my my

just another new kid in tow  oww  oww oww
(Oo-hoo) Ev'rybody's talkin' 'bout the new kid in town.
(Oo-hooh) Ev'rybody's walkin' like the new kid in town.

it was against the law
What the mama saw;
it was against the law

every time my name gets mentioned
The papa said oy, if I get that boy,
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention

  All the small things
  True care truth brings
  I'll take one lift
  Your ride, best trip
  Always, I know
  You'll be at my show
  Watching, waiting

  Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Nana nana nana nana na na
Nana nana nana nana na na
Nana nana nana nana na na

  Late night, come home
  Work sucks, I know
  She left me roses
by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares
  Say it ain't so, I will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home

That dance around your head
In your eyes I see that perfect world
I hope that doesn't sound too weird
And I want all the world to know
That your love's all I need
all that I need
and if we're lost,      then we are lost together
yea if we're lost,      then we are lost together

so much controlled by so few, stumbling from one disaster to another
I've heard it all so many times before
it's all a dream to me now, a dream to me now
and if we're lost,      then we are lost together
yea if we're lost,      then we are lost together
In the silence of this whispered night I listen only to your breath
and in that second of a shooting star somehow it all makes sense

time can bend your knee 
Time can break your heart, 
have you begging please 
begging please 
Beyond the door, 
there's peace I'm sure. 
And I know there'll be no more, 
tears in heaven 
Would you know my name,

Will it be the same,

I must be strong, and carry on

Praying for the healing rain                     To restore my soul again.
Just a toe rag on the run.                       How did I get here?  what have I done?
When will all my hopes arise?                    How will I know him?   When I look in my father's eyes.
Look into my fathers eyes, my father's eyes.                   When I look in my father's eyes.
Look into my fathers eyes, my father's eyes.                   
Then the light begins to shine                 And I hear those ancient lullabies.
And as I watch this seedling grow,              feel my heart start to overflow.
Where do I find the words to say?               How do I teach him? what do we play?
Bit by bit,        I've realized                That's when I need them,  That's when I need my father's eyes.
Then the jagged edge appears.                   Through the distant clouds of tears.
I'm like a bridge that was washed away.         My foundations were made of clay.
As my soul slides down to die.                  How could I lose him? What did I try?
Bit by bit, I've realized                       that he was here with me; I looked into my father's eyes.

 Through the long, dark night
 Out on the open sea
 By faith alone
 Sight unknown
 And yet His eyes were watching me
The anchor holds
Though the ship is battered
The anchor holds
Though the sails are torn
I have fallen on my knees
As I faced the raging seas
The anchor holds
In spite of the storm
 I've had visions
 I've had dreams
 I've even held them in my hand
 But I never knew
 They would slip right through
 Like they were only grains of sand
The anchor holds
Though the ship is battered
The anchor holds
Though the sails are torn
I have fallen on my knees
As I faced the raging seas
The anchor holds
In spite of the storm
 I have been young
 But I am older now
 And there has been beauty
 That these eyes have seen
 But it was in the night
 Through the storms of my life
 Oh, thats where God proved
 His love to me
The anchor holds
Though the ship is battered
The anchor holds
Though the sails are torn
I have fallen on my knees
As I faced the raging seas
The anchor holds
In spite of the storm
I have fallen on my knees
As I faced the raging seas
The anchor holds

Comming up a which way sign

Auctioned forearm
And whiskers in the sink

Cannot stay long

 It's apropos of nothing, he says his name is William
but I'm sure he's Bill or Billy, or Mac or Buddy
and he's plain ugly to me, and I wonder if he's ever
had a day of fun in his whole life
   We are drinking beer at noon on a Tuesday
in a bar that faces a giant car wash
   The good people of the world are washing their cars on their lunch break,
   hosing and scrubbing as best they can in skirts and suits
    They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
    back to the phone company and the record store too
    But they're nothing like Billy and me,
Cause all I wanna do is have some fun,
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun,
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun,
until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
   I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
and Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
   He shreds them on the bar, then he lights every match in an oversized
pack, letting each one burn, down to his
thick fingers before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud as they spin on the floor
        And a happy couple enters the bar,
          dangerously close to one another
          The bartender looks up from his want ads,
But all I wanna do is have some fun,
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun,
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun,
until the sun comes up over Santa Monica Boulevard
        Otherwise the bar is ours
          The day and the night and the car wash too
    The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
    The sun and the moon
But all I wanna do is have some fun,
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun,
I got a feeling I'm not the only one,
All I wanna do is have some fun,
I got a feeling the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun,

First the mic then a half cigarette
Singing cathy's clown
That's the man she's married to now
That's the girl that he takes around town
She appears composed so she is i suppose
Who can really tell
She shows no emotion at all
Stares into space like a dead china doll
I'm never gonna know you now, but i'm gonna love you anyhow
Now she's done and they're calling someone
Such a familiar name
I'm so glad that my memory's remote
Cos i'm doing just fine hour to hour note to note
Here it is the revenge to the tune
You're no    good
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Can't you tell that it's well understood
I'm never gonna know you now, but i'm gonna love you anyhow
I'm here today and expected to stay on and on and on
I'm tired
I'm tired
Looking out on the substitute scene
Still going strong
XO   mom
It's okay its alright nothing's wrong
Tell mr. Man with impossible plans
To just leave me   alone
In the place where i make no mistakes
In the place where i have what it takes
I'm never gonna know you now, but i'm gonna love you anyhow
I'm never gonna know you now, but i'm gonna love you anyhow
I'm never gonna know you now, but i'm gonna love you anyhow

I put my trousers on, have a cup of tea
and I think about leaving me house (Parklife!)
I feed the pigeons, I sometimes feed the sparrows too,
it gives me a sense of enormous wellbeing (Parklife!)
And then I'm happy for the rest of the day,

Broken and smokin' where the infrared deer plunge in the digital snake
I tell you, they make it so you can't shake hands when they make your hands shake
I know you like to line dance
Everything so democratic and cool
But, baby, there's no guidance when random rules
I know that a lot of what I say has been lifted off of men's room walls
Maybe I've crossed the wrong rivers and walked down all the wrong halls
But nothing can change the fact that we used to share a bed
And that's why it scared me so when you turned to me and said:
""Yeah, you look like someone
Yeah, you look like someone who up and left me low
Boy, you look like someone I used to know""
I know you'd like to line dance

He said, ""Steve, it's because people leave
And no highway will bring them back""
So if you don't want me, I promise not to linger
But before I go, I've gotta ask you, dear, about that tan line on your ring finger
No one should have two lives

British Lord Vestey and Vincent Lingiarri, were opposite men    on opposite sides.
Vestey was fat    with money and muscle.    Beef was his business, broad was his door.
Vincent was lean and spoke very little.    He had no bank balance, hard dirt was his floor.
From little things, big things grow. From little things, big things grow.
Gurindji were working for nothing but rations. Where once they had gathered the wealth of the land.
Daily the pressure got tighter and tighter. Gurindji decided they must make a stand.
They picked up their swags and started off walking. At Wattie Creek    they sat themselves down.
Now it don't sound like much but it sure got tongues talking, back at the homestead and then in the town.
From little things, big things grow. From little things, big things grow.
Well Vestey man said, 'I'll double your wages. Eighteen quid a week you'll have in your hand'.
Vincent said 'Uh-uh, we're not talking about wages. We're sitting right here 'til we get our land'.
Vestey man roared and Vestey man thundered, 'You don't stand the chance of a cinder in snow'.
Vince said, 'If we fall others are rising'.
From little things big things grow. From little things big things grow.
Then Vincent Lingiarri boarded an aeroplane, landed in Sydney. Big city of lights.
And daily he went round softly speaking his story to all kinds of men from all walks of life.
And Vincent sat down with big politicians, 'This affair', they told him, 'It's a matter of state.
Let us sort it out,   Why, your people are hungry.'  Vincent said 'No thanks, we know how to wait'.
From little things big things grow. From little things big things grow.
Then Vincent Lingiarri returned in an aeroplane, back to his country once more to sit down.
And he told his people 'Let the stars keep on turning. We have friends in the south, in the cities and towns'.
Eight years went by, eight long years of waiting 'til one day, a tall stranger appeared in the land.
And he came with lawyers and he came with great ceremony and through Vincents fingers poured a handful of sand
From little things big things grow. From little things big things grow.
Well that was the story    of Vincent Lingairri but this is the story of something much more.
How power and privilege can not move a people who know where they stand    and stand in the law.
From little things big things grow. From little things big things grow.
From little things big things grow. From little things big things grow.
From little things big things grow. From little things big things grow.
From little things big things grow. From little things big things grow.
From little things big things grow. From little things big things grow.

I could tell by how far the child's shadow stretched out and
He walked with a purpose
In his sneakers down the street
He had many questions
Like children often do
Tell me all your thoughts on God
and Tell me am I very far
Must of been late afternoon
On our way the sun broke free of the clouds
We count only blue cars
Skip the cracks in the street
And ask many questions
Like children often do
Tell me all your thoughts on God
Cause I'd really like to meet her
And ask her why we're who we are
Tell me all your thoughts on God
Cause I am on my way to see her
So tell me am I very far
Am I very far now
Its getting cold picked up the pace
How our shoes make hard noises in this place
Our clothes are stained
We pass many, cross eyed people
And ask many questions
Like children often do
Tell me all your thoughts on God
Cause I'd really like to meet her
And ask her why we're who we are
Tell me all your thoughts on God
Cause I am on my way to see her
So tell me am I very far

45,Driftwood,Travis,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/travis/driftwood-chords-94827,"Everything is open, nothing is set in stone
Rivers turn to oceans, oceans tide you home
Home is where the heart is, but your heart had to roam
Drifting over bridges never to return
Watching bridges burn
You’re driftwood floating underwater
Breaking into pieces, pieces, pieces
Just driftwood, hollow and of no use
Waterfalls will find you, bind you, grind you
Nobody is an island, everyone has to go
Pillars turn to butter, butterflying low
Low is where your heart is but your heart has to grow
Drifting under bridges, never with the flow
And you really didn’t think it would happen
But it really is the end of the line
So I’m sorry that you’ve turned to driftwood
But you’ve been drifting for a  long, long time
Everywhere there’s trouble, nowhere’s safe to go
Pushes turn to shovels, shovelling the snow
Frozen you have chosen the path you wish to go
Drifting now forever and forever more
Until you reach your shore
You’re driftwood floating underwater
Breaking into pieces, pieces, pieces
Just driftwood, hollow and of no use
Waterfalls will find you, bind you, grind you
And you really didn’t think it would happen
But it really is the end of the line
So I’m sorry that you’ve turned to driftwood
But you’ve been drifting for a long, long time
But you’ve been drifting for a long, long time
You’ve been drifting for a long, long
Drifting for a long, long time

 no son tan inutiles
 las noches que te di
 te marchas y que
 yo no intento discutirtelo
 lo sabes y lo sé.
 Al menos quédate solo esta noche
 prometo no tocarte estas segura
 Hay veces que me voy sintiendo solo
 Porque conozco esa sonrisa
 tan definitiva
 Tu sonrisa que a mí mismo
 me abrio tu paraíso
 Se dice que con cada hombre
 hay una como tu
 Pero mi sitio
 lo ocuparas con alguno
 Igual que yo mejor lo dudo
 ¿Por qué esta vez agachas la mirada?
 Me pides que sigamos siendo amigos
 Amigos para que maldita sea
 A un amigo lo perdono
 pero a ti te amo
 Pueden parecer vanales
 Mis instintos naturales
 Hay una cosa que
 que mis problemas sabes que
 solo por eso
 tu me ves hacerme el duro
 para sentirme
 un poquito mas seguro
 y si no quieres ni decir
 recuerda que también a ti
 Y en cambio tu,
 dices lo siento no te quiero
 Y te me vas con esta historia entre tus dedos
 Que vas a hacer
 busca una excusa
 y luego márchate
 Porque de mi
 no debieras preocuparte
 no debes provocarme
 Que yo te escribiré un par de canciones
 tratando de ocultar mis emociones
 Pensando pero poco en las palabras
 te hablare de la sonrisa
 tan definitiva
 tu sonrisa que a mí mismo
 me abrió tu paraíso
 Hay una cosa que
 que mis problemas sabes que
 solo por eso
 tu me ves hacerme el duro
 para sentirme
 un poquito mas seguro
 y si no quieres ni decir
 recuerda que también a ti

The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now, when I need you
Alone on an aeroplane
Falling asleep against the window pane
My blood will thicken
I need to wash myself again
to hide all the dirt and pain
Cus I’ve been scared that there’s nothing underneath
Who are my real friends
Have they all got the bends
Am I really sinking this low
baby’s got the bends,     oh no
We don’t have any real friends,    whoa, no, no
Just lying in the bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen
Where do we go from here
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you
They brought in the CIA, the tanks and the whole marines
To blow me away, to blow me sky high
baby’s got the bends
We don’t have any real friends
Just lying in the bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen
I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be part of the human race
I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be part of the human race, race, race, race

vertreiben
Und nicht grad’ allein geh’n und riefst
bei mir an.
Wir waren nur Freunde und wollten’s
auch bleiben,
Ich dacht’ nicht im Traum, dass was
passieren kann.
Ich weiß nicht wie ewig wir zwei uns
schon kennen.
Deine Eltern sind mit meinen damals
Kegeln gefahr’n.
Wir blieben zu Haus, du schliefst ein
vorm Fernseh’n,
  Wir war’n wie Geschwister in all’ den
Jahr’n.
Tausendmal berührt, tausendmal ist nix
passiert
Tausend und eine Nacht und es hat Zoom
gemacht.
Erinnerst du dich, wir ha’m Indianer
gespielt
Und uns an Fasching in die Büsche
versteckt.
Was war eigentlich los, wir ha’m nie
was gefühlt,
So eng nebeneinander und doch gar nix
gecheckt.
War alles ganz logisch, wir kennen uns
zu lange
Als dass aus uns noch mal irgendwas
wird.
Ich wußt’ wie dein Haar riecht und die
silberne Spange
  Hatt’ ich doch schon tausendmal beim
Tanzen berührt.
Tausendmal berührt, tausendmal ist nix
passiert
Tausend und eine Nacht und es hat Zoom
gemacht.
Wie viele Nächte wußt’ ich nicht, was
gefehlt hat.
Wär’ nie drauf gekommen, denn das warst
ja du.
Und wenn ich dir oft von meinen
Problemen erzählt hab’,
Hätt’ ich nie geahnt, du warst der
Schlüssel dazu.
Doch so aufgewühlt hab’ ich dich nie
gesehen,
Du liegst neben mir, und ich schäm’ mich
fast dabei,
Was war bloß passiert, wir wollten
tanzen gehen,
  Alles war so vertraut, und jetzt ist
alles neu. (Jetzt ist alles neu)
Tausendmal berührt, tausendmal ist nix
passiert
Tausend und eine Nacht und es hat Zoom
gemacht.
Tausendmal berührt, tausendmal ist nix
passiert
Tausend und eine Nacht und es hat Zoom

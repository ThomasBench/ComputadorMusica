0,Daughters (ver 4),John Mayer,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/john-mayer/daughters-chords-848996,"I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
but she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls are continually changed
And I've done all I can
To stand on her steps with my heart in my hand
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me
Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
Ooh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
cleaning up the mess he made
So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
Boys, you can break
You find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from
A wooooman's good, good heart
On behalf of every man
looking out for every girl
You are the guide and the weight of her world
So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers be good to your daughters, too
So mothers be good to your daughters, too
So mothers be good to your daughters, too.

        You needed someone to show you the way.
        So I took your hand and we figured out
        that when the time comes I'd take you away.
If you want to I can save you
I can take you away from here
        I'm sinking slowly, so hurry hold me.
        Your hand is all I have to keep me hanging on.

She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
With every bubble she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink
The dog days are over

The horses are coming so you better run

Run for your children and your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your loving behind you

The dog days are done
can you hear the horses cuz here they come 
And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had
And what was left after that too. oh.

Stuck from a great height

   Somewhere far away from here

   There's a restaurant down the street
   Where hungry people like to eat
   I could walk but I'll just drive
   It's colder than it looks outside

Then you try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn
When you try to see the world beyond your front door 
   Take your time 'coz the way I rhyme's gonna make you smile 
When you realize that a guy my size might take a while 
Just to try to figure out what all this is for
   It's the perfect time of day
   To throw all your cares away
   Put the sprinkler on the lawn
   And run through with my gym shorts on
   Take a drink right from the hose
   And change into some drier clothes
   Climb the stairs up to my room
   Sleep away the afternoon
   It's like a dream, you try to remember but it's gone
Then you try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn
When you try to see the world beyond your front door 
   Take your time 'coz the way I rhyme's gonna make you smile 
When you realize that a guy my size might take a while 
Just to try to figure out what all this is for
   Pinch me, pinch me, cause I'm still asleep 
   Please God tell me that I'm still asleep 
   On an evening such as this
   It's hard to tell if I exist
   Packed a car and leave this town
   Who'll notice that I'm not around?
   I could hide out under there
   I just made you say 'underwear'
   I could leave but I'll just stay
   All my stuff's here anyway
   It's like a dream, you try to remember but it's gone
Then you try to scream but it only comes out as a yawn

I'm not... broke I'm just a broken hearted man,
I know it makes no sense, but what else can I do,
How can I move on when I've been in love with you...
Cos if one day you wake up and find that your missing me,
And your heart starts to wonder where on this earth I can be,
Thinking maybe you'd come back here to the place that we'd meet,
And you'd see me waiting for you on the corner of the street.
So I'm not moving...
I'm not moving.
Policeman says son you can't stay her,
I said there's someone I'm waiting for if it's a day, a month, a year,
Gotta stand my ground even if it rains or snows,
If she changes her mind this is the first place she will go.
Cos if one day you wake up and find that your missing me,

Whos waiting on a girl...
There no hole in his shoes
But a big hole in his world...

And you'll come running to the corner...

The world can overwhelm me
There’s almost nothing that you could tell me
That could ease my mind
Which way will you run?
When it’s always all around you
And the feeling lost and found you again
A feeling that we have no control
Around the sun, some say
It’s going to be the new hell, some say
It’s still too early to tell, some say
Some say it really ain’t no myth at all
We keep asking ourselves
Are we really strong enough?
There’re so many things
That we got too proud of
Too proud of, too proud of
I want to take the preconceived
Out from underneath your feet
We could shake it off
And instead we’ll plant some seeds
We’ll watch them as they grow
And with each new beat
From your heart the roots grow deeper
The branches, well they reach for what?
Nobody really knows
But underneath it all
There’s this heart all alone
What about when it’s gone?
It really won’t be so long
Sometimes it feels like a heart
Is no place to be singing from at all
There’s a world we’ve never seen
There’s still hope between the dreams
The weight of it all could blow away with a breeze
But if you’re waiting on the wind
Don’t forget to breathe
Because as the darkness gets deeper
We’re sinking so we reach for love
At least something we can hold
But I’ll reach to you
From where time just can’t go
What about when it’s gone?
It really won’t be so long
Sometimes it feels like a heart
Is no place to be singing from at all.

The words and what they meant,
As we etched them with our fingers,
In years of wet cement.
Days blurred into each other,
Though everything seemed clear,
We cruised along at half speed,
But then we shifted gears.
We ran like vampires from a thousand burning suns!
But even then we should have stayed...
But we ran away,
Now all my friends are gone.
Well maybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved.
Ran away,
What are we running from?
A show of hands from those in this audience of one?
Where have they gone?
    Identities assume us,
As nine and five add up,
Synchronising watches,
To the seconds that we lost.
And I looked up and saw you,
I know that you saw me,
We froze but for a moment,
In empathy...
I bought down the sky for you but all you did was shrug
You gave my emptiness a name...
And you ran away,
Now all my friends are gone,
Maybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved.

i was standing on the surface of a perforated sphere
when the water filled every hole.
and thousands upon thousands made an ocean,
making islands where no island should go.
those people were overjoyed; they took to their boats.
i thought it less like a lake and more like a moat.

silenced forever more.

it seems farther than ever before

you were lonely and out of place.
You were looking down on me,
lost out in space.
Laid underneath the stars,
strung out and feeling brave.
I watched the red orange glow,
I watched you float away.
Down here in the atmosphere,
garbage and city lights,
you gotta save your tired soul,
you gotta save our lives.
Turn on the radio,
to find you on sattellite,
I'm waiting for the sky to fall,
I'm waiting for a sign.
And all we are is all so far.
You're falling back to me,
the star that I can't see.
I know you're out there,
somewhere out there.
You're falling out of reach,
defying gravity,
I know you're out there,
somewhere out there.
Hope you remember me,
when you're homesick and need a change.
I miss your purple hair,
I miss the way you taste.
I know you'll come back someday,
on a bed of nails I wait.
I'm praying that you don't burn out,
or fade away.

Do you leave dents where you sit, are you getting on a bit?

Is it lovey dovey stuff, do you need a bit of rough?

Yeah, turn down the love songs that you hear
'Cause you can't avoid the sentiment, That echoes in your ear
Saying love will stop the pain, saying love will kill the fear

Standing trial for your sins.
 Holding onto your self
The best you can.

Flash the message, ""Something's out there""
Floating in the summer sky
99 red balloons go by
99 red balloons
Floating in the summer sky
Panic bells, it's red alert
There's something here from somewhere else
The war machine springs to life
Opens up one eager eye
Focusing it on the sky
As 99 red balloons go by
99 Decision Street,
99 ministers meet
To worry, worry, super-scurry
Call out the troops now in a hurry
This is what we've waited for
This is it boys, this is war
The president is on the line
As 99 red balloons go by
99 Kriegsminister
Streichholz und Benzinkanister
Hielten sich fuer schlaue Leute
Witterten schon fette Beute
Riefen: Krieg und wollten Macht
Mann, wer haette das gedacht
Dass es einmal soweit kommt
Wegen 99 Luftballons

In every one a red balloon

In the dust that was a city
If I could find a souvenir
Just to prove the world was here...
And here it is, a red balloon
I think of you and let it go

Could you say goodbye to yesterday? 
Would you live each moment like your last? 
Leave old pictures in the past 
Donate every dime you have?

Against the grain should be a way of life 
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight 
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try 
So live like you'll never live it twice

Would you forgive your enemies? 
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of? 
Swear up and down to God above 
That you finally fall in love

If today was your last day 
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart? 
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars 
Regardless of who you are 
So do whatever it takes 
'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life 
Let nothin' stand in your way 
Cause the hands of time are never on your side

  When all you got to keep is strong
  Move along Move along Like I know ya do
  And even when your hope is gone
  Move along Move along Just to make it through
  Move along
  Right back what is wrong
  we move along
  Right back what is wrong
  We move along
  Right back what is wrong
  we move aloooooooong 
  Right back what is wrong 
  We move along

For profits alone 
  That very same man 
He lives his life all alone 
  And the road to life 
Yes it goes up and down 
   Doesn't really matter 
As long as the music goes on

Never let me go
I lay it all down again
To hear you say that I'm your friend
You are my desire
No one else will do
Cause nothing else could take your place
To feel the warmth of your embrace
Help me find the way,     bring me back to you
You're all I want
You're all I've ever needed
You're all I want
Help me know you are near

49,Fallen Leaves,Billy Talent,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/billy-talent/fallen-leaves-chords-745285,"In a crooked little town they were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
   I hitched a ride    until the coast
   To leave behind   all of my ghost
   Searching for something   I couldn't find at home
   Can’t get no job,   can you spare a dime?
   Just one more hit   and I’ll be fine
   I swear to God this   will be my one last time
In a crooked little town they were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
   When it gets dark    in Pigeon Park
   Voice in my head   will soon be fed
   By the vultures   that circle round the dead
In a crooked little town they were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
   I never once thought    I’d ever be caught
   Staring at sidewalks    hiding my track marks
   I left my best friends    or did they just leave me?
In a crooked little town they were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
In a crooked little town they were lost and never found
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown or the streets will beat you down
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground
Run away before you drown
Fallen leaves, fallen leaves, fallen leaves on the ground

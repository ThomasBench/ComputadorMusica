With an achin' in my head
I lay motionless in bed
I thought of you, and where you'd gone
Let the world spin madly on
And everything that I said I'd do
Like make the world brand new
And take the time for you
Just got lost and slept right through the dawn
And the world spins madly on
I         let the day go by
I          always say goodbye
I watch the stars  from my windowsill
The whole world is moving, but I'm standing still
Woke up and wished that I was dead
With an aching in my head
I lay motionless in bed
The night is here and the day is gone
And the world spins madly on
I thought of you and where you'd gone
And the world spins madly on
And the world spins madly on
And the world spins madly on and on and on
...and on and on...

If I pretend that nothin' ever went wrong,
I can get to my sleep
I can think that we just carried on

No hope, or love, or glory
Happy endings gone forever more

No, I don't care about the soaps
No, I don't care about the soaps
Though I'm acting like I'm in an Eastenders episode

Kill the director

Kill the director please
Carrots help us see much better in the dark
Don't talk to girls; they'll break your heart
And this is my head and this is my spout
They work together; they can't figure anything out
So with the angst of a teenage band
Here's another song about a gender I'll never understand

And the shy tormented youth sit way over there
And the songs they get louder

Where you gonna go
Where you gonna sleep tonight
And you’re singing the songs
And you wake up in the morning and your head feels twice the size

Where you gonna sleep tonight

Am I falling
Was it our last embrace

I am trying to survive
Victim of my desire

  on the south side of the town on the wrong side of the tracks
  sometimes on the way into town we say
  mama can we stop and give her a ride
  sometimes we did but her hands flew from her side
 wild eyed...crazy...Mary
  down a long dirt road  past the Parson's place
  their old blue car  we used to race
  a little country store, with a sign tacked to the side
  said no L-O-I-T-E-R-I-N-G allowed
  underneath that sign always congregated quite a crowd
  take a bottle, drink it down, pass it around
  take a bottle, drink it down, pass it a, pass it a, pass it around
 one night the thunder cracked, mercy backed outside her windowsill
 dreamed I was flying high, above the trees, over the hills
 looked down into the house of Mary
  bare bulb on, newspaper covered walls
  and Mary rising up, above it all
  ah...... ah......
   next morning on the way into town  
   we saw some skid marks and followed them around
  over the curb, through the fields, into the house of Mary
that what you fear the most will meet you half way

is there a spell that I am under

have a heart and try me

stand naked and accused

47,John Wayne Gacy Jr,Sufjan Stevens,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/sufjan-stevens/john-wayne-gacy-jr-chords-1203505,"   His father was a drinker
And his mother cried in bed
   Folding John Wayne's t-shirts
When the swingset hit his head
   The neighbors, they adored him
For his humor and his conversation
   Look underneath the house there
Find the few living things, rotting fast in their sleep
Of the dead, twenty-seven people
Even more, they were boys with their cars, summer jobs
Oh, my Go-o-o-od
   Are you one of them?
   He dressed up like a clown for them
With his face paint white and red
   And on his best behavior
In a dark room on the bed
He kissed them all, he'd kill ten thousand people
With a sleight of his hand, running far, running fast
To the dead, he took off all their clothes for them
He put a cloth on their lips, quiet hands, quiet kiss
On the mo-o-o-outh
   And in my best behavior
I am really just like him
   Look beneath the floorboards
For the secrets I have hid

Make it all better when I'm feelin' sad
Tell me that I'm special even when I know I'm not
Make me feel good when I hurt so bad
Barely gettin' mad, I'm so glad I found you
I love bein' around you
You make it easy, it's as easy as 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4
There's only one thing to do
Three words for you I love you
There's only one way to say
Those three words and that's what I'll do, I love you
Give me more lovin' from the very start
Piece me back together when I fall apart
Tell me things you never even tell your closest friends
Make me feel good when I hurt so bad
Best that I've had, I'm so glad that I found you

They'll miss the good old days
Someday, someday
Yeah, it hurts to say
But I want you to stay
Sometimes, sometimes
When we was young
Oh, man, did we have fun
Always, always
Promises
They break before they're made
Sometimes, sometimes
Oh, Maya says I'm lacking in depth
I will do my best
You say you want to stay by my side
Darling, your head's not right
I see alone we stand, together we fall apart
Yeah, I think I'll be alright
I'm working so I won't have to try so hard
Tables they turn sometimes
Oh, someday
And now my fears
They come to me in threes
So I sometimes

You say the strangest things
I find sometimes""

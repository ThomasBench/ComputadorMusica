0,In Too Deep,Genesis,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/genesis/in-too-deep-chords-1033380," All that time I was searching
With nowhere to run to
It started me thinking
 Wondering what I could make of my life
 And who'd be waiting
 Asking all kinds of questions to myself
But never finding the answers
 Crying at the top of my voice
 And no one listening
 All this time I still remember everything you said, a haaaa
 There's so much you promised
 How could I ever forget? Listen
 You know I love you but I just can't take this
 You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
 Although I need you I'm not gonna make this
 You know I want you but I'm in too deep
 So listen, listen to me
Oh you must believe me
I can feel your eyes go through me but I don't know why
 Oh I know you're going
but I can't believe
It's the way that you're leaving
 It's like we never knew each other at all
 It may be my fault
 I gave you too many reasons being alone
When I didn't want to
 I thought you'd always be there
 I almost believed you
 All this time I still remember everything you said, a haaaa
 There's so much you promised
 How could I ever forget? Listen
 You know I love you but I just can't take this
 You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
 Although I need you I'm not gonna make this
 You know I want you but I'm in too deep
 So listen, listen to me
I can feel your eyes go through me
 It seems I've spent too long
Only thinking about myself
 And now I want to spend my life
Just caring 'bout somebody else, you listen
 You know I love you but I just can't take this
 You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
 Although I need you I'm not gonna make this
 You know I want you but I'm in too deep
 You know I love you but I just can't take this
 You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
 Although I need you I'm not gonna make this
 You know I want you but I'm in too deep

1,Once Bitten Twice Shy,Great White,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/great-white/once-bitten-twice-shy-chords-1771957," Well the times are getting hard for you, little girl
 I'm a humming and a strumming, all over God's world
 You can't remember when you got your last meal
 And you don't know just how a woman feels
 You didn't know what rock and roll was,
 until you met my drummer on a grey tour bus
 I got there in the nick of time,
before he got his hands across your state line, yeah
 Now it's the middle of the night on the open road
 And the heater don't work and it's oh so cold
 You're looking tired, you're looking kind of beat
 The rhythm of the street sure knocks you off your feet
 You didn't know how rock and roll looked,
until you caught your sister with the guys from the group
 Halfway home in the parking lot,
by the look in her eye she was giving what she got
 My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, Baby,
 my, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, Baby
 My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, Baby
 Woman you're a mess going to die in your sleep
 There's blood on my amp and my Les Paul's beat
 Can't keep you home, you're messing around
 My best friend told me you're the best lick in town
 You didn't know that rock and roll burned,
so you bought a candle and you lived and you learned
 You got the rhythm you got the speed,
Mama's little baby likes it short and sweet
 My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, Baby,
 my, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, Baby
 My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, Baby
 I didn't know you had a rock and roll record,
 until I saw your picture on another guy's jacket
 You told me I was the only one,
but look at you now, it's dark and you're gone
 My, my, my, I'm once bitten, twice shy, Baby,

  A smell of wine and cheap perfume
  For a smile they can share the night

Hiding, somewhere in the night

Just one more time

    All the stars were hanging in mid-air.
    In these moments - nothing mattered,
    But the way you caught me in your stare.
    We were laughing about the state of our lives;
    As the moon was rising in your eyes.
On and on the night was falling
Deep down inside us.
On and on a light was shining right through...
 Ah, la Luna, la Luna,
 The night that we fell under the spell of the moon.
 Ah, la Luna, la Luna,
 The light that will bring me back to you,
 The light of la Luna.
    In the hotels, in the cafes,
    All the world was made with romance.
    All the ships were swaying in a dance.
    And I knew I had to be with you.
    You didn’t ask me, you just took me
    To the tiny bed in your tiny room.
On and on the band was playing
A song of surrender.
On and on the sun would soon break thru...
 Ah, la Luna, la Luna,
 The night that we fell under the spell of the moon.
 Ah, la Luna, la Luna,
 The light that will bring me back to you.
 Ah, la Luna, la Luna,
 The night that we fell under the spell of the moon.

 The light that will bring me back to you,
 The light of la Luna.

Now I walk along the streets of Marseilles,
The winter sky is cold and gray.
And I don’t know why I left you that day,
And I don’t know where you are

 All of the cars.
Were once just a dream,
In somebody's head.
She pictures the broken glass,
 Pictures the steam.
She pictures a soul,
With no leak at the seam.
 Let's take the boat out,
 Nowhere in the corridors,
Of pale green and grey.
 Nowhere in the suburbs,
In the cold light of day.
 There in the midst of it,
So a-live and alone.
 Words support like bone.

 Where you're in-side out.
Dreaming of mercy,
In your daddy's arms a-gain.

 Swear they moved that sign.
Dreaming of mercy,
In your daddy's arms...
 Pulling out the papers,
From the drawers that slide smooth.
 Tugging at the darkness,
 Word upon word.
Con-fessing all the secret things,
In the warm velvet box,
To the priest; he's the doctor,
He can handle the shocks.
 Dreaming of the tenderness,
The tremble in the hips;
Of kissing Mary's lips.
 Mer-cy Street,
 Where you're in-side out.
Dreaming of mercy,
In your daddy's arms a-gain.
Dreaming of Mer-cy Street,
 Swear they moved that sign.
Dreaming of mercy,

 Mercy...
Looking for mercy...
Looking for mercy...
Looking for mercy...

Is out in the boat,
 Riding the water,
 Riding the waves on the sea.

Last night me and Kate we laid in bed talking about getting out
Packing up  our   bags  maybe heading south
I'm thirty-five we got a boy of our own now
Last night I sat him up behind the wheel and said son take a good look around

12,Gun Street Girl,Tom Waits,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/tom-waits/gun-street-girl-chords-876971," Falling James, in the Tahoe mud,
Stick around to tell us all the tale.
Well, he fell in love with a Gun Street girl,
He took a hundred dollars off a, Slaughterhouse Joe,
Brought a brand new Michigan twenty-gauge.
He got all liquored up on that road house corn,
He bought a second-hand Nova from a Cuban Chinese,
And dyed his hair in the bathroom of a Texaco.
With a pawnshop radio, quarter past four,
I said John, John; he's long gone,
He's sitting in a sycamore, in St. John's wood,
Soaking day-old bread in kero-sene.
Well, he was blue as a robin's egg and brown as a hog,
 Shadow fixed the toilet with an old trombone,
He never get up in the morning on a Saturday.
 Sitting by the Erie with a bull-whipped dog,
Now the rain's like gravel on an old tin roof,
Burlington Northern pulling out of the world.
Now a head full of bourbon and a dream in the straw,
Well he's riding in the shadow by the St. Joe ridge,
Hearing the click-clack tapping of a blind man's cane.
He was pulling into Baker on a New Year's Eve,
Miss Charlotte took her satchel down to King Fish Row,
Smuggled in a brand new pair of alligator shoes,
With her fireman's raincoat and her long yellow hair,
I said John, John; he's long gone,
 Banging on the table with an old tin cup,
I said John, John; he's long gone,

And a hundred lonely housewives clutch empty milk bottles to their hearts
Hanging out their old love letters on the line to dry

In a town called malice ooo yeah
A whole street's belief in Sunday's roast beef
Gets dashed against the co-op
To either cut down on beer or the kids' new gear
It's a big decision in a town called Malice oo oo yeah
The ghost of a steam train echoes down my track
It's at the moment bound for nowhere just going 'round and 'round
Playground kids and creaking swings lost laughter in the breeze

   You get to meet in all sorts - in this line of work
   Treachery and treason - there's always an excuse for it

But over the mountains - Across the sea

Calling my name

Since the day I was born          With no one to blame
The candle is burning - It's way down low

Which way to go.

Looking for love to surround me
The love that I need To rescue the state of my heart

And we ain't going home 'til we've done what's right
We're gonna drink Camden Town dry tonight
If I have to spend my last pound
When I first got to London it was pourin' down rain
Met a little girl in the field canteen
Painted her name on the nose of my plane
Six more missions I'm gone
Well I asked if I could stay and she said that I might
Then the warden came around yelling ""turn out the lights""
Death rainin' down in the London night
We made love 'til dawn

They've got rivers of gold

It's no place for the old

On a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me
Broadway was waiting for me
You were handsome
Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
All the drunks they were singing
We kissed on the corner
Then danced through the night

Were singing 'Galway Bay'
And the bells were ringing
Out for Christmas Day

You're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead
on a drip in that bed
You scum bag
You cheap lousy faggot
Happy Christmas your arse

I want a ticket to anywhere.
Maybe we make a deal,
Maybe together we can get somewhere.
Any place is better.
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose.
Maybe we'll make something,
Me myself, I got nothing to prove.
You got a fast car.
I got a plan to get us out of here:
I been working at the convenience store,
Managed to save just a little bit of money.
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city, 
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living.
You see, my old man's got a problem:
He live with the bottle, that’s the way it is.
He says his body's too old for working,
His body's too young to look like his.
My mama went off and left him, she wanted more from life than he could give,
I said, ""Somebody's got to take care of him.""
So I quit school and that's what I did.
You got a fast car.
But is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision:
Leave tonight or live and die this way.
So I remember when: we were driving, driving in your car,
The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk,
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder. 
And I   had a feeling that I belonged
And I   had a feeling I could -- be someone, be someone, be someone.
You got a fast car.
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves;
you still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl.
I know things will get better:
You'll find work and I'll get promoted, 
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs.
So I remember when: we were driving, driving in your car,

You got a fast car.
And I got a job that pays all our bills.
You stay out drinking late at the bar,
You see more your friends than you do your kids.
I'd always hoped for better,
Thought maybe together you and me would find it,
I got no plans I ain't going nowhere,

  I know I've been wearing crazy clothes and I look pretty crappy sometimes
  But my body feels so good and I still sing a razor line everytime
And when it comes to all night living
I know what I'm giving
I've got it all down to a tee
And it's free
  When I say I love you, you say you better,    (You better you better you bet)
  When I say I need you, you say you better     (You better you better you bet)
  When I say I love you, you say you better,    (You better you better you bet)
  When I say I need you, you scream you'd better     (You better you better you bet)
  When I say I love you, you say you better,    (You better you better you bet)
  When I say I need you, you say you better     (You better you better you bet)
  When I say I love you, you say you better,    (You better you better you bet)
  When I say I need you, you scream you better     (You better you better you bet)
               You better bet your life
  Or love will cut you                           Just like a knife

And I don't care if I'm here tomorrow

Of all the things that cost you too much

To the childhood I lost, replaced by fear

That my life would depend on the morning sun

Very small boys talked to me
Now that we've grown up together
They're afraid of what they see
That's the price that we all pay
And the value of destiny comes to nothing
I can't tell you where we're going
I guess there was just no way of knowing

we left as inmates from an asylum.
And we were sharp, as sharp as knives
and we were so gung-ho to lay down our lives.
We came in spastic like tameless horses,
we left in plastic as numbered corpses.
And we learned fast to travel light, 
our arms were heavy but our bellies were tight.
We had no home front, we had no soft soap.
They sent us Playboy, they gave us Bob Hope.
We dug in deep and shot on sight
and prayed to Jesus Christ with all of our might.
We had no cameras to shoot the landscape
we passed the hash pipe and played our Doors tapes.
And it was dark, so dark at night
and we held on to each other, like brother to brother,
we promised our mothers we'd write.
And we would all go down together,
we said we'd all go down together,
yes, we would all go down together.
Remember Charlie, remember Baker,
they left their childhood on every acre.
And who was wrong? And who was right?
It didn't matter in the thick of the fight.
We held the day in the palm of our hand.
They ruled the night and the night seemed to  last
as long as six weeks on Parris Island.
We held the coastline, they held the highlands,
and they were sharp, as sharp as knives,
they heard the hum of motors, they counted the rotors
and waited for us to arrive.
And we would all go down together,
we said we'd all go down together,
yes, we would all go down together.

But if my silence made you leave
Then that would be my worst mistake
So I will share this room with you
And you can have this heart to break
And this is why, my eyes are closed

er lebt
du fehlst... 
 es ist o.k., 
alles auf dem Weg, und es ist 
Sonnenzeit ungetruebt und leicht 
und der Mensch heisst Mensch
weil er vergisst, weil er verdraengt 
und weil er schwaermt und glaubt,
sich anlehnt und vertraut und weil 
er lacht und weil 
er lebt
du fehlst...

Made of stone
Charlie clown, 
No way home
Bring on the dancing horses
Headless and all alone
Shiver and say the words
Of every lie you've heard
First I'm gonna make it
Then I'm gonna break it
Till it falls apart
Hating all the faking
And shaking while I'm breaking
Your brittle heart
Billy stands 
All alone
Sinking sand, 
Skin and bone
Bring on the dancing horses
Wherever they may roam
Shiver and say the words
Of every lie you've heard
First I'm gonna make it
Then I'm gonna break it
Till it falls apart
Hating all the faking
And shaking while I'm breaking
Your brittle heart
Brittle heart, brittle heart
Brittle heart and my little heart goes

Wherever he may roam
Bring on the new Messiah

To realize
But somethings take a long long
Long long time (a long time)
Hold the phone
Hit repeat
You got me folding at the knees
Saw the flame
tasted sin
You burned me once again
Cut the cord,
she's a creep
Aberdeen!
Way back, way back...
Never saw my dark side
In, in your eyes
Back and forth bloody fingers
Paintin up the sky
The sky
Hold the phone
Hit repeat
You got me folding at the knees
Saw the flame
tasted sin
You burned me once again
Cut the cord,
she's a creep
Aberdeen!
Way back, way back...
Hold the phone
Hit repeat
You got me folding at the knees
Saw the flame
tasted sin
You burned me once again
Cut the cord,
she's a creep
Aberdeen!
Way back, way back...

1,Ashes Of Eden,Breaking Benjamin,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/breaking-benjamin/ashes-of-eden-chords-1745777,"Will the faithful be rewarded
When we come to the end
Will I miss the final warning
From the lie that I have lived
Is there anybody calling
I can see the soul within
And I am not worthy
I am not worthy of this
Are you with me after all
Why can't I hear you
Are you with me through it all
Then why can't I feel you
Stay with me, don't let me go
Because there's nothing left at all
Stay with me, don't let me go
Until the Ashes of Eden fall
Will the darkness fall upon me
When the air is growing thin
Will the light begin to pull me
To its everlasting will
I can hear the voices haunting
There is nothing left to fear
And I am still calling
I am still calling to you
Are you with me after all
Why can't I hear you 
Are you with me through it all
Then why can't I feel you
Stay with me, don't let me go
Because there's nothing left at all
Stay with me, don't let me go
Until the Ashes of Eden fall
  Don't let go, don't let go, don't let go
Don't let go, don't let go, don't let go
Why can't I hear you
Stay with me, don't let me go
Because there's nothing left at all
Stay with me, don't let me go

Heaven above me,     take my hand
Shine until there's nothing left but you

The cedar trees, the morning air
The way the dew sits on her hair
So peacefully below a Texas sky
I think I’ll leave her lying there
Take a walk I don’t know where
Just bathing in the sunlight in my life
I hear the sound of windy leaves
Summer birds and gently flowing
Rivers creeks and pools up from the spring
The music of the water on the rocks is getting louder
As I walk towards whatever life may bring
Just outside of Austin
High as I have ever been
Just outside of Austin
I think I fell in love with you again
I went out to play the other day
The city and it’s city ways
A time and place for everything you’d say
But I just want to sit at home
Ride my horse or write a song
A little bit of weed and I’m okay
Those nights when it’s just you and me
Or maybe soon we could be three
It ain’t so bad a place to raise a kid
Or maybe we should wait awhile
No need to hurry nothing
I’m just saying I’d be happy if we did
Just outside of Austin
High as I have ever been
Just outside of Austin
I think I fell in love with you again
Just outside of Austin
High as I have ever been
Just outside of Austin
I think I fell in love with you again
I think I fell in love with you again

about some pain that they once felt
There's no one I disapprove of more, or root for more than myself
I wanted to pretend that it was better, better, better on the phone
I didn't wanna tell you I was jealous, jealous, jealous and alone
So we talk about ourselves in hell
To forget the love we never felt
All the old jokes that work so well
Universal truth was a moment's lie
Don't try to stop us
Don't try to stop us
Don't try to stop us

Got to get to climb your tree in the light of the living ghost I see
She sees her father in the old man's eyes while secretly he stares at her thighs
Animals on TV singing about some they may felt at some point
I didn't want to tell you I was jealous, jealous, jealous, what's the point?
As I watched the velvet drapes appear
And the door was closed for fourty years
As we hide what we don't wanna hear
As we hide what's really in our ears
He is coming from a part of hell
Where lightning blue eyes don't go down well
He can't tell that we're oblivious
It's addiction of routine as well
Making fools out of the best of us
Making robots of the rest of us
Innocence itself in America today
There's a crime just like Cornel West might say

Don't try to stop us
Don't try to stop us

In darkening grey we walked back through the streets

Instead I'm typing you a message

Rewriting old excuses
Delete the kisses at the end

To just that room
And then I remember and I'm shy
That gossip's eye will look too soon
And then I'm trapped, overthinking
And yeah, probably self-doubt
You tell me to get over it
And to take you out
But I can't, I'm too scared
And there's the night-bus, I have to go
And the doors are closing and you were waving
And I like you, and I'll never let it show

That you 'rock my world!'
You do, you really do
You've turned me upside down
And that's okay, I'll let it happen
'Cause I like having you around
I'm a love-trick, a romantic cliche
And they really are all true
And we catch eyes in a stupid party
I know exactly what to do
I'll take your hand, and we will leave

I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
People would say, ""They're the lucky ones""
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fall out
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls that I can't break through
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you
Like it's killing me?
I don't know what to say since a twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now-  Next chapter
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes
And trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should have held me
Oh, we're scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you
Like it's killing me?
I don't know what to say since a twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
    This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you'd say you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
      In a crowded room  and we're not speaking                    
And I'm dying to know is it killing you
Like it's killing me?

Looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, no-----ow
   And we're not speaking

Dreamed to discover a new space
And buried himself alive
Inside his basement, tongue on the side of his face meant
He's working away on displacement
And what it would take to survive
'Cause when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you
And his wife told his kids he was crazy
And his friends said he'd fail if he tried
But with a will to work hard and a library card
He took a homemade, fan-blade, one-man submarine ride
That morning, the sea was mad and I mean it
Waves as big as he'd seen it
Deep in his dreams at home
From dry land, he rolled it over to wet sand
Closed the hatch up with one hand
And peddled off alone
'Cause when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you
And for once in his life it was quiet
As he learned how to turn in the tide
And the sky was a flare when he came up for air
In his homemade, fan-blade One-man submarine ride
One evening
When weeks had passed since his leaving
The call she'd planned on receiving
Finally made it home
She accepted
The news she'd never expected
The operator connected
A call from Tokyo
'Cause when you're done with this world
You know the next is up to you 
Now his friends bring him up when they're drinking
At the bar with his name on the side
And they smile when they can
As they speak of the man
He took a homemade, fan-blade, one-man submarine ride

How could you be so cold?

You need to watch the way you talkin' to me though
I mean after all the things that we've been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Hey yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Hey yo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you gon' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely

How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?
How could be so Dr. Evil?
You're bringin' out a side of me that I don't know
Why we up 3 a.m. on the phone?
Why does she be so mad at me for?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
'Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple months then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me
In the night I hear 'em talk, the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
How could you be so heartless?
Talkin', talkin', talkin' talk
Baby let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got somethin' new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight ...

Witness to the arc toward the sun.
A neighbors blessed burden within reason.
Becomes a burden borne of all in one.
And nobody, nobody knows.
Let the yoke fall from our shoulders.
   Don't carry it all, don't carry it all.
   We are all our hands and holders.
Beneath this bold and brilliant sun.
This I swear to all.
Monument to build beneath the arbors.
Upon a plinth that towers toward the trees.
Let every vessel pitching hard to starboard.
Lay it's head on summer's freckled knees.
And nobody, nobody knows.
Let the yoke fall from our shoulders.
   Don't carry it all, don't carry it all.
   We are all our hands and holders.
Beneath this bold and brilliant sun.
This I swear to all......and this I swear to all.
And there a wreath of trillium and ivy
Laid upon the body of the boy.
Lazy will the loam come from it's hiding.
Return this quiet certitude to the soil
So raise a glass to turnings of the season.
And watch it as it arcs towards the sun.
And you must bare your neighbors burden within reason.
And your labors will be borne when all is done.
And nobody, nobody knows.
Let the yoke fall from our shoulders.
   Don't carry it all, don't carry it all.

Some cities make you lose your head
Endless suburbs stretched out thin and dead
And what was that line you said
You watch the life you're living disappear

  Our minds are troubled by the emptiness.
  Destroy the middle, it's a waste of time.
From the perfect start to the finish line.
And if you're still breathing, you're the lucky ones.
'Cause most of us are heaving through corrupted lungs.
Setting fire to our insides for fun
Collecting names of the lovers that went wrong
The lovers that went wrong.
  We are the reckless, we are the wild youth
Chasing visions of our futures
One day we'll reveal the truth
That one will die before he gets there.
And if you're still bleeding, you're the lucky ones.
'Cause most of our feelings, they are dead and they are gone.
We're setting fire to our insides for fun.
Collecting pictures from the flood that wrecked our home,
It was a flood that wrecked this... 
  And you caused it,
  And you caused it,
  And you caused it,
Well I've lost it all, I'm just a silouhette, 
A lifeless face that you'll soon forget, 
My eyes are damp from the words you left, 
Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest.
Ringing in my head, when you broke my chest.
And if you're in love, then you are the lucky one,
'Cause most of us are bitter over someone.
Setting fire to our insides for fun, 
To distract our hearts from ever missing them.
But I'm forever missing him.

I opened it to find death staring in my face,
The feel of mortal stalking still reverberates,
Everywhere I go I drag this coffin just in case.
My bodies tremblin' sends shivers down my spine,
Adrenaline kicks in shifts into overdrive,
Your secrets keep you sick your lies keep you alive,
Snake eyes every single time you roll with crooked dice,

The kind of dark that haunts a hundred year old house,

Running from my past I'm praying feet don't fail me now!

Sunglasses indoors par for the course, lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles

She's having a sly indoor smoke,
She calls the folks who run this her oldest friends,
Sipping her drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent
Her eyes invite you to approach

That you just swallowed have got you going

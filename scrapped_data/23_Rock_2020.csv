0,Lamore Lamore,Vasco Rossi,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/vasco-rossi/lamore-lamore-chords-3946223," Tu con me
 Lui con te
 Lei che l’ama fino in fondo
 Sta con sé
 Lei con lei
 Lui con lui
 Non ci credi fino a quando ti ritrovi lì
Eh sì, può andare anche così
 L’amore a prima vista
     L’amore che non basta
     Lui è sempre nel tuo cuore
Io soltanto per due ore
Perché fa libidine
Ma lui è più sensibile
L’amore, l’amore, l’amore, l’amore
L’amore, l’amore, l’amore, l’amore
L’amore, l’amore, l’amore, l’amore
Si fa con le mani, si fa con il cuore
 Si fa come si vuole
L’amore, l’amore, l’amore, l’amore
L’amore, l’amore, l’amore, l’amore
L’amore, l’amore, l’amore, l’amore
 Tu con me
 Lui con te
 Qui non si capisce bene la storia com’è
    Ci vuole il buttafuori
     I sensori
     Per buttare i cattivi pensieri
Per evitare gli ostacoli
Quando siamo fuori
Quando restiamo da soli
Lei con me
L’amore, l’amore, l’amore, l’amore
L’amore, l’amore, l’amore, l’amore
L’amore, l’amore, l’amore, l’amore
L’amore, l’amore, l’amore, l’amore
Si fa con le mani, si fa con il cuore
 Si fa come si vuole
L’amore, l’amore, l’amore, l’amore
L’amore, l’amore, l’amore, l’amore
L’amore, l’amore, l’amore, l’amore
L’amore, l’amore, l’amore, l’amore

1,Cielo Hermético,Fito & Fitipaldis,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/3469250,"Suelo confundirme con facilidad,
lo que siento y lo que escribo,
A veces pienso que soy un sueño tan real
Que casi me siento vivo
Y te lo juro que no puedo saber
Y te lo juro todo estaba oscuro
Aquellos años pasaron tan rapido
A dos gramos por segundo
La vida se nos va, tan rápido
No hay tiempo de sentir, el vértigo
A veces duele mas que un látigo
Vivimos bajo un cielo hermético
Sabes, si quieres que te adore como un santo
Contageame la risa y curame el espanto
No quiero recordarlo otra vez
Tarde, quizas para empezar ya sea tarde
Quiza desde el principio fuera tarde
Y solo lo supimos después
La vida se nos va, tan rápido
No hay tiempo de sentir, el vértigo
A veces duele mas que un látigo
Vivimos bajo un cielo hermético
Yo te escribí la frase,
mas triste de mi vida
Tu nunca la recuerdas
y es mas triste todavía
No dejo de buscarte
No duermo sin pastillas
Disparo a mis verdades
con pistolas de mentira
La vida se nos va, tan rápido
No hay tiempo de sentir, el vértigo
A veces duele mas que un látigo
Vivimos bajo un cielo hermético
Vivimos bajo un cielo hermético

2,The Bridge,Sting,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/sting/the-bridge-chords-3956284,"They say there's a bridge up there
Up there in the mist
Some will deny it's there
Others will tell you it don't even exist
It's not made of iron or steel nor stone
Yet it spans the rising waters
We are but bags of blood and bone
If we carry the weight of our sons and our daughters
And now that feels are rather drowned
And we climb up to the ridge
Some will seek the higher ground
Some of us the bridge
If all is bеhind us now
Beneath us swollen rivеr
The bridge we will find somehow
Only then we would be delivered
Though some will claim to be inclined
It's a figment or a ghost
But the bridge is deep inside the mind
Invisible to most
And now the city's all but drowned
And here upon the ridge
Some will seek the higher ground
Some of us the bridge
We'll open the gates that we may follow
Open the bridge to all of us
Open the floodgate to the river
Open the bridge that we may cross

3,The Bridge Album,Sting,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/sting/the-bridge-chords-3956338,"  How many times have I had this dream
That wakes me from my slumber?
How will I ever get to sleep again
Counting sheep in a Book of Numbers?
  How many times have I had this dream
With you walking towards me from the river?
  And when will I ever get to rest again
  Wondering if I can deliver?
This is the sound of rushing water
Flooding through my brain
This is the sound of God's own daughter
Calling out your name
This is the sound of atmospheres
Three metric tonnes of pressure
This is the sum of all my fears
Something I just can't measure
I remеmber the story of Jonah
He was trappеd in the belly of a whale
How many times must he succeed?
How many times must he fail?
This is the sound of rushing water
Flooding through my brain
This is the sound of God's own daughter
Calling out your name
 I'll see my shrink on an analyst's couch
Hit me with a hammer and I'll say, ""Ouch""
What we have here is so easy to solve
Just takes a firm purpose and some resolve
This is the sound of rushing water (Rushing water)
Flooding through my brain (Flooding through my brain)
This is the sound of God's own daughter (God's own daughter)
Calling out your name
This is the sound of rushing water (Rushing water)
Flooding through my brain (Flooding through my brain)
This is the sound of God's own daughter (God's own daughter)
Calling out your name
Your name, your name
Your name, your name
Your name, your name, your name, your
        Ease into the water
Flooding through your brain
Ease into the water
Calling out your name
Ease into the water
Flooding through your brain
Ease into the water
Jumped out of bed this morning
With a smile upon my face
It's still there while I shave my chin
But the reasons hard for me to trace
I cook myself some breakfast
Have some coffee while I muse
Where could this smile have come from?
It's a muscle that I rarely use
Call the doctor with my symptoms
Should I spend all day in bed?
Can you explain what's ailing me?
And this is what my doctor said
If it's love, it has no season
If it's love, there is no cure
If it's love, it won't see reason
And of this you can be sure
If it's love, you must surrender (You must surrender)
If it's love that's turned you 'round (That's turned you 'round)
If it's love, the odds are slender (The odds are)
If it's love, you're sunk without a trace
One case can bring you down
You smile and your heart skips a beat
You hear a church bell chiming
A sound that's ringing in your ears
Will set your heartbeat climbing
And my doctor's diagnosis?
His opinion and a quote, ""I'll write you a prescription""
And this is what my doctor wrote
If it's love, it has no season
If it's love, there is no cure
If it's love, it won't see reason
And of this you can be sure
If it's love, you must surrender (You must surrender)
If it's love, then you must yield (Then you must yield)
If it's love, the odds are slender (The odds are)
If it's love, the trap's already laid
And I'm afraid your fate is all but sealed
Bring me a glass of water
To wash the dirt from my throat
I've been wandering my whole life out there
Help me out of my coat
This water's as clear as crystal
We should thank the Lord for that
Sit you down and hear my story
Find somewhere for my hat
A barkeep takes a stranger's hat
And finds a vacant hook
Turns back towards the traveller
His right hand on an old black book
The holy Book of Numbers
I take it's something that you've read?
The long search in the wilderness
For a place to lay my head
So many parables in the scriptures
But this one I'm doomed to tell
For I stormed the gates of Heaven
To find myself in Hell
This is my lonely mission
To wake the world up to its fate
To dismantle my own invention
For the hour is getting late
This holy Book of Numbers
As we walk through the shadow of death
Tell me, are you listening, boy
Or am I just wasting my breath?
There are fools in the courts of power
While I've walked through this vale of bitter tears
At the mercy of recording angels
For three score and twenty-five years
The barkeep gets up from the table
To fill up another glass
He turns around to find an empty chair
All that's left is the name in his hat
 You say that I don't listen
 That I don't give you no respect
 You took your love to some other place
 Now, what did you expect?
 We made vows inside the church
 To forgive each other's sins
 But there are things I have to endure
 Like the smell of another man's skin
 If that's not loving you, I don't know what is (I don't know what)
If that's not loving you, then tell me what it is
If that's not loving you, I don't know what is (I don't know what)
If that's not loving you, then tell me what it is
 You say you wanted children
 And you would grow into a mother
 But in my mind's eye, I would see you
 In the arms of another
 I am given to jealousy
 I've been given to violence
 But I could never raise a hand in my defence
 So I suffer here in silence
 If that's not loving you, I don't know what is (I don't know what)
If that's not loving you, then tell me what it is
If that's not loving you, I don't know what is (I don't know what)
If that's not loving you, then tell me what it is
 I pray the waters of forgiveness
Will rain down on you and me
Just like newborn babies
 In the cradle of a tree
 And we will walk in righteousness
 We will walk in rain and thunder
 And what God has joined together here
 Let no man put asunder
 If that's not loving you, I don't know what is (I don't know what)
If that's not loving you, then tell me what it is
If that's not loving you, I don't know what is (I don't know what)
If that's not loving you, then tell me what it is
If that's not loving you, I don't know what is (I don't know what)
If that's not loving you, then tell me what it is
If that's not loving you, I don't know what is (I don't know what)
If that's not loving you, then tell me what it is
Is commonly known as being the wrong side of town
They look down their noses at you
Like they're entitled to keep you down
Our street has its social issues
And violent crime by the bucket load
They laughed when they named it Harmony Road
They say where you're born
Will have an effect on how you turn out in life
So how can you make a living
When all you have is a pocket knife?
You don't have the choice to run
From anothеr violent episode
Wеlcome to life here on Harmony Road
One day, we'll make a break
Get out of here, make no mistake
We'll steal a car
Find a happy song on the radio
And never come back to Harmony Road
You walk down the hill
And past the old factory shuttered for twenty years
There used to be work
But you wonder how you'll ever get out of here
If I had a song in me
I would pay off all of the debts I owed
I'm all out of tune on Harmony Road
I'll find us some money
And I will take you with me, I promise you
I'll buy you some fancy clothes
And we'll do all the things we wanted to
And no one will know
That we're any different, we're just à la mode
The king and the queen of Harmony Road
  One day, we'll make a break from here
We'll make it big and have no fear
Won't carry the social stigma
Of being judged by our postal code
And we will be done with Harmony Road
But then in our dreams
Are we to be haunted by what we left behind?
That road has a way of
Pulling you back if ever you give it mind
No matter the riches
And all the palaces where we may have strode
We'll always belong to Harmony Road
We'll always belong to Harmony Road
  What would a man not do?
  What would a man not say?
  What would a man not agree to?
  What would he not betray?
  Where would a man fear to trespass?
  Where would a man not stray?
  What crime would a man not admit to?
  What price would a man not pay?
(For her love)
He's got no money but his head's up in the stars
(For her love)
He'll spray her name across a streetcar
(For her love)
If he can't read between the lines up there on Mars
(For her love)
He'll find some meaning in a street light
  What would a man not consent to?
  What would a man not face?
  What would a man not agree to?
  What lies would a man not embrace?
(For her love)
Hе'll find a job, he'll work his fingers to the bonе
(For her love)
She's safely sleeping in the moonlight
(For her love)
He'll save his money, buy a place to call their own
(For her love)
And he will be the one she loves
By the stretch of my fingers
(For her love)
By the strength in my hands
By the blood that flows in my veins
By the pulse of my beating heart
By the sun up in Heaven, by the moon and the stars
By the circling planets
And the lines on the surface, the surface of Mars
  What would a man not do?
  What would a man not say?
Oh, the hills on the border
'Bout this time of the year
When the mists seem to gather
In the valley of your fears
And you walk through that valley
As day turns to night
Is there something in the shadows
Or the failing of the light?
I was walking home last evening
When perhaps I should have ran
From a darkening of shadows
In the shape of a man
It said, ""Talk to me, stranger
Or may I call you brother?
Let us make our way together
From this place to another
I don't carry any weapon
I don't carry any staff
But I'll carry half your burden
Till your journey's cut in half
Let me sharе of your burden
The lifetimе you will carve
And the gravestone that you carry
Will be a burden halved""
He sat down by the roadside
As the mists they gathered 'round
Takes some cards from his pocket
That he spreads upon the ground
He said, ""This card is a woman
You will love but not possess
And this card's a man you'll murder
But you'll never confess
I don't carry any weapon
I don't carry any staff
But I'll carry half your burden
Till your journey's cut in half
Let me sharе of your burden
The lifetimе you will carve
And the gravestone that you carry
Will be a burden halved""
I said, ""Why should I trust you?
Or the cards that you have thrown?
I don't know you from the Devil
And this burden is my own""
He said, ""I have the gift of secrets
From our Father, little brother
Let us make our way together
From this world to another""
Oh, the hills on the border
'Bout this time of the year
When the mists seem to gather
In the valley of your fears
And you walk through that valley
Your coat around your ears
As you walk to the borders
From the valley of your fears
As you walk to the borders
From the valley of your fears
As you walk to the borders
From the valley of your fears
A noble lord of high degree
Imprisoned in some foreign country
To spend his life in captivity
He is a captain in the King's own Navy
He'd spent his life upon the cold grey sea
What would he give now for a plate of meat and gravy
Or for an angel to appear and set him free
For seven years he lives on bread and dirty water
A single candle in his prison room for light
Into the cell will walk the pretty jailer's daughter
The cloak she's wearing is as black as any night
She is a creature of captivating beauty
As this bold captain's hungry eyes would ever see
She looks upon him with the eye of love's desire
And so he begs her, ""Lady, will ye set me free?""
""What can you offer if you gain your freedom?
I'll lose my heart if I should ever set you free
I have the keys if you'll deliver me a promise
Should I release you, then you'll vow to marry me""
""You are a creature of captivating beauty
We could run and make a life beyond the sea""
He takes her hand in his and makes a solemn promise
""Unchain me now and I will vow to marry thee""
Beneath the city walls and down into the harbour
She'll throw his chains into the wine-dark sea
They'll find a ship, but now his hand is forced to stay her
""In truth, I never could have married thee""
She was a creature of captivating beauty
He still has many miles of ocean to traverse
His broken promises will move the gods to anger
All broken promises will render matters worse
She sees the black storm clouds on the horizon
His solemn promises lie broken
And whispered on the wind, as if it's spoken
He'll hear a maiden's curse
I wake up in Antwerp
In some rich woman's bed
There's a man with a hammer
Inside of my head
She says, ""I couldn't wake you
I thought you were dead
But you talked in your sleep
I don't know what you said""
I look in the mirror
My eyes bleeding red
There's a taste in my mouth
Don't know how I got here
Or if I was led
But I know it's a Sunday
For the bells in my head
As they call to the faithful
The quick and the dead
The last days of judgement upon us
And the bells on the roof of St. Thomas
Are calling
Shе says, ""Are you hungry?
You look underfed""
""No, I'd bеtter be going
I'll have coffee instead""
""Let me give you some money""
I say, ""There's no need
You don't owe me nothing
It's what we agreed""
But the room's like a palace
In a book I once read
And the words that I'm thinking
Would be better unsaid
I search for my clothes
Then she asks if I'll stay
""There's a room for you here
My husband's away""
The bells of St. Thomas
Are aching with doubt
They're cracked and they're broken
Like the earth in a drought
I've searched for their meaning
I just never found out
Whatever they're expecting from us
Or why the bells on the roof of St. Thomas
Are crying
I walk to the church, though it's empty by now
The roof like an overturned ship, and a prow
For a pulpit, and there it is upon the wall
St. Thomas inspecting the wounds for us all
It's a painting by Rubens
Painted from life
And it's flanked by a rich man
And his elegant wife
The wounds we all share
And yet still need the proof
You can feign your indifference
Pretend you're aloof
But the wounds we're denying are there all the same
And the bells of St. Thomas start ringing again
The saint I was named for
The sceptical brother
The rich man's wife
In the arms of another
And the exit wounds
Of a love that's gone wrong
She said she was leaving
But she'd already gone
And the last days of judgement are finally upon on us
And the bells on the roof of St. Thomas
Are calling
They say there's a bridge up there
Up there in the mist
Some will deny it's there
Others will tell you it don't even exist
It's not made of iron or steel nor stone
Yet it spans the rising waters
We are but bags of blood and bone
If we carry the weight of our sons and our daughters
And now that feels are rather drowned
And we climb up to the ridge
Some will seek the higher ground
Some of us the bridge
If all is bеhind us now
Beneath us swollen rivеr
The bridge we will find somehow
Only then we would be delivered
Though some will claim to be inclined
It's a figment or a ghost
But the bridge is deep inside the mind
Invisible to most
And now the city's all but drowned
And here upon the ridge
Some will seek the higher ground
Some of us the bridge
We'll open the gates that we may follow
Open the bridge to all of us
Open the floodgate to the river
Open the bridge that we may cross
I cannot get to my love if I would die;
The water of Tyne runs between her and me
And here I must stand with a tear in my 'ee
Both sighing and sickly, my true love to see
Oh, where is the boatman, oh, my bonny hinny?
Oh, where is the boatman? bring him to me
To ferry me over the Tyne to my honey
And I will remember the boatman and thee
It's starting to rain and I'm froze to the marrow
I see her as plainly as she can see me
It's less than a mile between North Shields and Jarrow
And the ship of my heart's carriеd out to the sea
Oh, bring me a boatman, I'll give any money
And you for your troubles rewarded shall be
To ferry me over the Tyne to my honey
Or scull her across the rough river to me
Sittin' in the mornin' sun
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' comes
Watchin' the ships roll in
Then I watch 'em roll away again
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time
I left my home in Georgia
And headed for the 'Frisco Bay
'Cause I got nothin' to live for
Looks like nothin's gonna come my way
Just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time
 Looks like nothin's gonna change
 Everything seems to stay the same
 I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same
Sittin' here restin' my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
Two thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this dock my home
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watchin' the tide roll away
I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time

God created the heavens and the earth
Then he created the waters and the land
And then he created man
But man degenerated and descended
Into the black hole of making bad music
So a darkness fell all around
Only he could know of the storm that was coming
The hurricane that was brewing
Yes, there was something wrong, something missing
 So he sent an angel
And out of the mist, that angel came
He wore boots,   blue jeans
And a baseball cap
He had a big old smile like a welcome mat
 Then all the world went silent and they looked up
Because they wall wanted to hear what he had to say
And after a moment's silence, he said
Let there be guitar
Drums
Bass
Piano
Let there be a kickass, kickass rocking band
Let's go
Oh
Oh, yeah
Alright
Well, if you're looking for some, turn the music on
And let's light a real big fire
If you wanna blast, let's kick some ass
We'll raise the roof a little bit higher
If you need a rush, grab your favorite crush
Gotta go against the grain
If you're here for the show and you're ready to go
Let's ride this crazy train
If you like some kickass rocking music
We're a kickass rocking band
If you can't play a lick, just play anything
Raise hell and clap your hands
Spread the word, bring your friends
The whole wide world is joining in
If you love some kickass rocking music
We're a kickass rocking band
Oh yeah
If you want the good back in the good times
Get the grease back in your gears
Come on, bang your drum and make your guitar strum
Put the buzz back in your beer
If you want a real sure thing, let the singer sing
Turn the tunes on up to ten
If you had a long, hard day, you need to get away
It's time to rock and roll again
If you like some kickass rocking music
We're a kickass rocking band
If you can't play a lick, just play anything
Raise hell and clap your hands

  Wirkt ziemlich abgeschabt
 Ein Coupon von Sanifair
  Gleitet in die Hand als er
  Durch das Drehkreuz geht
 Sich gegenüber steht
 Und in den Spiegel schreit:
Nie wieder Krieg
Nie wieder Krieg
Nie wieder Krieg
 Keine Verletzung mehr
Nie wieder Krieg
Nie wieder Krieg
Nie wieder Krieg
 Das ist doch nicht so schwer
Sie sieht vom Balkon herab
  An diesem Neujahrstag
An dem das Alte stirbt
  Noch nichts geboren wird
 Gebete zynisch bleiben
 Zieht es durch Kitt und Scheiben
 Auf die sie haucht und schreibt:
Nie wieder Krieg
Nie wieder Krieg
Nie wieder Krieg
 Keine Verletzung mehr
Nie wieder Krieg
Nie wieder Krieg
Nie wieder Krieg
 Das ist doch nicht so schwer
  Dann hat ein Feuerwerk
 Sich in die Luft verirrt
 Das in den Himmel schreibt
Der Mond sieht auf dich herab
  Du liest im Horoskop:
""Sie können erleichtert sein
 Man wird ihnen bald verzeihen""
 Als ein kleines Kind
 Über die Hecke springt
 Und an die Wände schreibt:
Nie wieder Krieg

Someday you'll see it if you stay

Walk the wire, face your fire
Someone will need your strength

Are gonna be your glory

And just let it fall

You choose how mystery's defined, so take this song as a sign
And make your pain your saving grace

En voor lange tijd verdwijnt,
Voel ik intens verdriet ontstaan,
En dan ben ik weer zo klein.
Wist ik veel dat kil zo kil kon zijn,
Dat eenzaamheid veel erger is dan pijn.
M’n vrienden zeggen mij, het komt wel goed,
Dat is wat het leven met je doet.
En langzaam sta ik recht,
In de verte zie ik weer,
Het einde van de weg,
Die ik bewandel,
De ommekeer.
Ik,
Dans en ik leef,
Ik bid en ik zweef,
Adem diep in,
Kom weer op dreef,
Al mijn demonen,
Verjaag ik uit mijn dromen.
En alles krijgt vorm,
Alles heeft zin,
Er woedde een oorlog binnenin,
Maar nu sluit ik vrede,
En kap met het verleden.
Want ik voel de kracht,
Die ik heb gemist,
Die de nacht heeft uitgewist,
Weg met de zorgen,
Want ik dans weer tot de morgen.
Want ik heb gehuild,
De hel doorstaan,
Ben door het diepste dal gegaan,
Maar ik leef nog,
Meer dan ooit, ik leef nog.
Nu raas ik als een wervelwind,
Ik schreeuw het uit en heb zo’n zin,
Om veel te luid, weer recht door zee te gaan.
En al wat nu nog komen gaat,
En dat beloofd te wacht te staan,
Het maakt niet uit,
Ik kan de toekomst aan.

He said, ""Yo, let's get that wave""
I said, ""Yes, just tell me where""
Board's up top, wind in my hair
From the mind of Frida Kahlo
Show me love and I will follow
From the words of my old man (Old man)
Conversations in the sand
This slice of life when you're out on the road
Is always extra nice when there's someone to hold
Ay-oh, way-oh
Would you be my traffic jam?
Ay-oh, way-oh
Spirographic anagram
Ay-oh, way-oh
Would you be my traffic jam?
Ay-oh, way-oh
Would you be mine?
I got a slice of life that's built for you
Oh, now, come and give me something to spread my bread onto (Onto)
T-t-t, t-t-t, time and time again, we get a window and a clue
Time and time again, life-changing rendezvous
Anyway, made a left on third
Got distracted, jumped that curb
Unaware and on her walk
I hit the brakes, made time to talk
She said, ""Can I get that ride?""
Oh my God, just get inside
It was all that I imagined
Born to ride, enthusiasm
Packed our bags and headed west
PCH, I'm so impressed
My friends said, ""Havin' fun yet?""
We drove off into the sunset
This slice of life when you're out on the road
Is always extra nice when there's someone to hold
Ay-oh, way-oh
Would you be my traffic jam?
Ay-oh, way-oh
Spirographic anagram
Ay-oh, way-oh
Would you be my traffic jam?
Ay-oh, way-oh
Would you be mine?
Would you be mine?
Would you be mine?
Would you be mine?
Would you be mine? (Be mine, woah)

And I don't tell my mom
I mix you with my vodka
And it turns me on
There's a hole in my heart and I can't find the bullet
But you sleep with the firearm
I should've pulled it on you
Now that we're through
I get drunk with my friends
Your name never comes up
I tell strangers online
That we broke up
There's a hole in my heart and I hate that it's there
'Cause I liked to act like I really don't care
But I do
What a shame that I put up with you
What a joke, was it all just an act?
I hate that it took me so long to react
You had me convinced that you loved me
What a fucked up reality show
Was it fame or the lack thereof?
I just don't know
You had me convinced that you loved me, oh
I'm not sure you realize
The pain that you caused
I don't feel like talking
But everyone else does
There's a hole in my heart and I can't find the bullet
But you sleep with the firearm
I should've pulled it on you

Seeing ghosts and breaking things
Room's on fire as I sit and watch it melt around me
I've been hosting screenings
Of slightly altered movie scenes
Seems familiar 'til I realize that they look just like me
Where am I? I can't find the door
Where the houses all can talk
And now we're in a basement
I feel wasted and I'm sure
That you'll kiss me anyway
That'll be just the thing to wake me
Maybe I'm weird or maybe I'm off the wall
But maybe it's weirder not to have dreamed at all
I can walk through walls now
Quietly I roam the halls
Suddenly I'm ten feet tall and I can touch the ceiling
I think I scared you off now
I'm regretting getting close hoping
It was just a ghost that sorta looked just like you
Where am I? I can't find the door
Where the houses all can talk
And now I'm in a maze
Down in this basement and I'm sure
That you'll miss me anyway
That'll be just the thing to wake me

But maybe it's weirder not to have dreamed at all

Are you lying through your teeth or are they paying through your nose?
A set of manners and a smile is all they want you for
But we can talk about it later, you can read it in the paper
I hated you away from the very start
I seen you sticking to your smile, it’s gone and broken my heart
Now the wind is making work of every step on the bridge
You say ""I used to say we found each other, now I don’t know where he is""
You get that feel, make your spirit shinе
I let her prize apart my ribcagе like a crackhead at the blinds, it hurt
But come the downing of a scrapyard sun
There is no light falls on our failure, it ain’t covered in the paper
Well I really don’t care what you think of me
But something gears me to the grovel every opportunity
I’ve got that jealous stripe, I probably am that type
I’ll see you twenty Mary’s later when your tongue is talking straighter
Heard he took ‘em all down to the mercenary bar
I heard she broke up with her fella, now he’s drinkin’ in his car, nah
I’m not inclined towards the scandalous word
But on the subject of myself, I do believe what I’ve heard
There is a track beneath the wheel and it’s there till we die
She says ""I don’t agree with nothing"", I say “Neither do I”, go to sleep
There’s not a thing can’t be fixed with a dream
And we can talk about it later, you can read it in the paper
I bet you, I bet you, I bet you now
I bet you, I bet you, I bet you now
I bet you, I bet you, I bet you, I bet you now

Talking ’bout a nervous breakdown
Even he don’t know
How to bail us out of this one
“What a mess!” I sing to myself
Thinkin’ ’bout another song
I wanna reach out to old Jesus
Tell him I, too, feel alone
And I’m here to save ya
Jesus on a wire
And he’s lookin’ very tired
And me, I don’t blame him
And I almost want to claim him
So I ring a couple chords out
On my Martin Double O
And I see them floating upward
And I watch ’em as they go
Into the pockets of Judas Iscariot in the sky
Up through the cracks in the ceiling
Jesus on the edge
And I feel the same way lately
And he hammers down some numbers
And it shakes the sky like thunder
I saw him risin’ o’er the horizon
And I saw him fall
When the scene dissipated
And the world just waited and waited
For a return

And the wool over my eyes
When I needed support, to feel the burn
To lift me up to new heights
Sensation, compelling, and I’m closer to the edge
Temptation, alluring, yet I taste regrets
 And who will pay the price, the lost or the damned
 When nothing will open eyes like steel in my hand?
We’re heroes and villains by chance
Heroes and villains by choice
All in onе voice
All in one voice
Bеguiling words painted lips with soot
Made an empty shell of your lies
Exquisite hurt as the truth takes root
In the hollows of your eyes
Sensation, tormenting, and I’m closer to the edge
Temptation, enduring, yet I taste regrets
 And who will pay the price, the lost or the damned
 When nothing will open eyes like steel in my hand?
We’re heroes and villains by chance
Heroes and villains by choice
 What is it to you, can you deny
What is a secret to a lie?
Spins a world so watertight
It hides salvation in plain sight
 Sensation, so telling, and I’m closer to the edge
Temptation wears my ring, yet I taste regrets
 Who will pay the price, the lost or the damned
 When nothing will open eyes like steel in my hand?
We’re heroes and villains by chance
Heroes and villains by choice

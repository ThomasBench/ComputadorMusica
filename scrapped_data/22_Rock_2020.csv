And we're in an apartment
In the capital city
In a Catholic country
Got my back on the carpet
And my feet to the ceiling
To get the blood flowing
To numb the pain I'm feeling
The more I know about you
The more I know I want you
The less I care about who
Was there before I found you
The more I know about you
The more I know I want you
The less I care about who
Was there before I found you
Yesterday she took me
To a wintery garden
Past a forest of consciеnce
On a curvy road
With every hour of passing
I startеd to believe in
The bubble I've been dreaming
Had a floor on the ceiling
(Oh, oh, oh)
The more I know I want
The more I know I
The more I know I want
The more I want you
The more I know I want
The more I know I
The more I know I want
The more I want you
Ah-ah
To be with someone so precious
That it makes me anxious
To be there by the target
And know that I could miss it
I never felt so lonely
As when you came and saw me
And the following moment
Took your eyes off me
The more I know about you
The more I know I want you
The less I care about who
Was there before I found you
The more I know about you
The more I know I want you
The less I care about who
Was there before I found you

Down to, the garden, where magnolias bloom
Baby, darling, devil, I love you
I love you, I love you
Kill me in the morning
Call your, mother, tell her you love her
Call my, mother, and tell her the same
You write, good things

You're plastered, I'm fine

But here I am, fucked up
Dirty, the dishes, stack them higher
We're not gonna, wash them, we'll throw them away

When things were okay
And I know, that you'll follow

I know, you'll follow
And I know
No one's, hearing, what I'm saying
You are, but you are, so far away
Fuck me, 'til my, brains start dripping
Down to, the second, floor in our home

On my shoulder in the back of your boyfriend's car
We're coming home
From a sermon saying how bent and evil we are
I try to imagine what you're dreaming
You're muttering nonsense between steady breathing
I have to wake you up to get out
Your man waves from the end of the drive 'til I'm in the house
He can be nice, sometimes
Other nights, you admit he's not what you had in mind
All in all, nobody's perfect
Therе may be better, but you don't feel worth it
That's whеre we disagree
You always wanted to raise a baby by the lake
Maybe they'll grow up and never make the same mistakes
Knowing you, they'd be the first kid to never hurt another
I see you look at him and wonder if he'll make you a mother
But if you get married, I'd object
Throw my shoe at the altar and lose your respect
I'd rather lose my dignity
Than lose you to somebody who won't make you happy

   Light a candle for the sufferin’
   Send my best wishes with the wind
All our candles, hopes, and prayers
   Though well-meanin’ they don’t mean a thing
Unless we see some change
I might change my sheets today

The bike wobbles side to side

Painting the faded brick
What’s the point; it looks fine from up here
Well time is money and money is no man’s friend
And all eyes on the pavement, I’m not gonna touch ya
Don’t worry so much about it
I’m just waiting for the day to become night

   And there’s one thing I know
   The sun will rise today and tomorrow
We got a long long way to go
Well time is money and money is no man’s friend
And all eyes on the pavement, I’m not gonna touch ya

You and me, skies above and wide, it brings on the true night on me
All I could feel was a “goodbye”
Those only words you wrote, it’s plenty to understand ya
The sun is going down, the sky behind and visions of you would stand
Overlapping with you and the fence beyond
Remember the night that we met up
Broke into me and taken everything left in my heart
So fragile is that air, it always keeps on revolving near and wide
Loneliness envelops deep in your eyes
It’s stuck in “tick-and-tocking” mode| Never refraining shamble, block of sound
Too many terrible noises around and the voice ringing in me gets louder
With tears about to fall
I need to find me an average happy tiptoe| Locating, never tough when I’m with you
Saw what got seen hid beneath, and louder nights keep beating
I’m going to you, and giving brighter shiny tomorrows
What can “night” for you mean, infinite? You could run with me
Place your hand in mine, you gotta stay, hold up
Want to leave it behind, dark cruel days, in deep, you may have hid before
I’m embracing you until more heat dissolve what is caught up
Sun will soon rise up into a day you’re no more too afraid
Keep all of me in you
Only perceiving through your eyes
I see nothing, I’ll soon hate you, keep me out, I’m crying out
You’re falling into deeper fascination, giving away your love
That expression has got me crying out
She’s gonna try to me, she’s gonna lie | Got to force a belief and trust to keep on
Every time it happens, heap of attack, and now I’m back in | I got to cry, then who knows?
So we gotta keep on | If you gotta keep on | Then we’re gonna keep on
One day, we will understand, I’m believing in you
“No, wanna stop it, you got me tired of walking”
As I show my needs, I reach to get back on, still not fit in | You free my hand, then leave it
“No, wanna stop it, you got me tired of walking”
Never told you the truth, I’m feeling that inside
Back for another “tick-and-tocking” mode | Never refraining shamble, block of sound
Killing, oh, too many words that I gathered around, won’t let me go to your mind
“I want it to be done” is what went out
It found a way to finally leak out of me
And for once, I could make you let out a smile
Saw what got seen hid beneath, and louder nights are keeping me down
My new images of you, now, appear heavenly now
What can “night” for you mean when fallen seas of tears are gone
They dissolve into the peace inside of you
Calling to life, hit beneath, crying days in the eternal
Give me what I saw in you, oh, what an end to stop all
Seize a move, you’re on me, falling and we were dissolving
See me to it, fog is leaving, bright air move

And nobody downtown
If nobody hears you

And continue to not

I loop like a bug
And all I ever wanted
Was a really tight hug
  I'll call her again
But she's a huge fucking ghost
I fell for dead air
'Cause it was all I could host
And I'll cut up my shirts
And I'll sing in the rain
It doesn't quite matter
'Cause it all feels the same
I don't want what I want
Feels bad to feel good
I'm made of bad code
I'm waterlogged wood
Ride through the feeling
Stay in bed for the fun
The brand-new beginning
And I'm already done
The future is static
It drips on the floor
And makes its way underneath my bedroom door
A glitch in the game
I loop like a bug
And all that I ever died for
Was another tight hug
 So just get wrecked
I mean you kinda failed the cool kids' test
It's kinda sad if this is you at your best
It's not fun anymore

That's just the way it is, that's the mystery of love.

'Cause I've been messed up, stressed out, talking to myself again
Locked up, left out, terrified of everything
Wound up, found out, waiting around for something to give
Don't you ever wake up and suspect
That you were simply never cut out to be
The kind of person they expect
Thе person you intended to bе?
And I keep it all in with my idiot grin
And I'm doing my best but there's very little left
So cut me some slack if I crawl back into my shell
I haven't been doing so well
I haven't been doing so well
I got a brand new name for an old, old friend
The doctor said it's anxiety
And it makes a lot of sense
'Cause I've been so tense
Some days I find it difficult to see
'Cause I've been hemmed in, penned down, struggling to find myself
Caved in, cut down, scared of everybody else
Dragged in, dragged down, searching for a reason to live
Don't you ever wake up and suspect
That you were simply never cut out to be
The kind of person they expect
Thе person you intended to bе?
And I keep it all in with my idiot grin
And I'm doing my best but there's very little left
So cut me some slack if I crawl back into my shell
I haven't been doing so well
Couldn't you tell?
And if self-loathing was a sport I'd be Muhammad Ali
'Cause I can sting like a butterfly and sink like a bee
But they don't hand out medals to monsters like me
Oh well
I haven't been doing so well
Maybe I can do with some help
I haven't been doing so well
Maybe I can do with some help
'Cause every day I wake up and suspect
That I was simply never cut out to be
The kind of person they expect
The person I intended to be
'Cause I'm not Joe Strummer, not Muhammad Ali
Not a teacher, not a builder
Just uncomfortable me
And maybe, just maybe, I'll admit that I could use a little help
I haven't been doing so well

Been so afraid of everything
I need a chance to be reborn.
I never wanted anything that someone had to give
I don't live here anymore
I went along with you.

You're always on my mind
I know it ain't like I remember
I guess my memories run wild
Like when we went to see Bob Dylan
We danced to Desolation Row.
But I don't live here anymore
But I got no place to go
Beating like a heart
I'm going to walk through every doorway I can start
I need some time, I need control, I need your love
I want to find out everything I need to know
I'm going to say everything there is to say
Although you've taken everything I need away
I'm going to make it to the place I need to go
We're all just walking through this darkness on our own
Time surrounds me like an ocean
My memories like waves
Is life just dying in slow motion
Or getting stronger every day?
I never took our love for granted.
You never left me wanting more.
But you never recognized me, babe
I don't live here anymore.

I avoid the street that you live on
You're a magnet pulling my feet and my head off
And I scramble my brain
Wasting away
Looking for ways that I can avoid you
To pull the weeds, suck the venom
I avoid the street that you live on
You're a magnet pulling my feet and my head off
And I scramble my brain
Wasting away
Looking for ways that I can avoid you
To pull the weeds, suck the venom
I avoid the street that you live on
You're a magnet pulling my feet and my head off
And I scramble my brain
Wasting away
Looking for ways that I can avoid you
To pull the weeds, suck the venom...

      Hating
      Hoping
      Faking
 I've been digging through the dirt that was left behind
 I've been drudging through the mud for it
 There's nothing that's alive or dead inside
 In you, or in this
 The crucifix in my hand's a lie
 'Cause nothing ever kills you
 I've water down the pain till the well went dry
 So pray for rain
 And it gnawed
 Rose to the top again
 Back like a long lost friend
 A wretch that I can't defend
 Oh my god
 Is this where the dreamer ends
 Dark where the light had been
 Lost at the war within
   And it clawed
   Back in the world again
   Hеre for a new revеnge
   An enemy I can't condemn
   Oh my god
   Is this where the liar ends?
   Dark where the light had been
   Lost at the war within
 Out of myself, I can feel it crawling
 How can I tell if this is the ending?
 Out of myself, it began evolving
 I am not well, repent I'm guilty
 How can I tell if the sky is falling?
 How can I fix what there is no mending?
 How can I tell if I am not well?
 I've lost myself
 I have come undone
 And all of the horses
 And all of the men
 Or bury it where it had been
 When all of the forces
 Have been overrun
 You'll whisper, serpent tongue
 What you fear you have become
        Something wicked this way comes
        Something wicked this way comes

Ain't got no time to lose

To desperate men
Easily could run from the start
When you're fallin'
I been drivin' on the west side again
And the rain keeps pourin' down
    Finally figured out my way
I been living on the run, 'cause I can't find
The thing that holds and binds us time
I'm out here dying in the heat
Oh, what am I to find?
Yeah, will it open the door
To desperate men?
Easily could run from the start
Sheltered and dead
I hear your call
Crawl if I didn't wait for the fall
Shelter in the doorway
From rising storms
Coursing in the darkness
When we have fallen
How can I replace that
What can't be lost?
I don't wanna change
I'll rise above it
There's so many ways our love can make it through
    But it's so damn hard to make that change
Maybe I was born too late for this lonely freedom fight
    Maybe I was born in the wrong way
Maybe born on the wrong day

Where it flows outside the lines
Where it's picked apart and thrown away

I'm living down by an old par three

Come around, don't take it hard
Don't let 'em stone you when the comedown starts
You've been moving much too fast
You never know just where it ends
What will I find living this life without you?
I got swept up in a world so strange
One you'd never even recognize
Oh, but I slipped away
Now I'm a stranger and I don't know why
It's killin' mе, but your words
They brought me out onto steady ground
Whеn I was wounded and ashamed
And now that my heart is empty
Where should I go?
You've always been a constant
My northern star, where do I go
Yeah, without you?
Feel the storm coming on
Feel the darkness at your gate
Live the loneliest of life
Keep on moving at your pace
Ain't the sky just shades of gray
Until you seen it from the other side?

These chains are ashes now
That once were rusted on
I was a runaway
Now I am finally home
My mind was a ghost town
Haunted by yesterday
Until Your hand reached down
Pulled me out of my grave
Into the freedom found
Only in Jesus' Name
I am forgiven
No longer lost
Now I am living
In the power of the Cross
The Father gave his Son
So I could be set free
And now the scales are gone
My eyes can finally see
I'll tell the world of all
Jesus has done for me
I am forgiven
No longer lost
Now I am living
In the power of the Cross
Goodbye to sorrow
Welcome, my joy
Now I am living
In the power of the Cross

Through sacrifice, the old made new

No longer lost

Waking up with anybody else but you

The love is lost and the love is found
Another city, another show
Curtains up and away we go
In the hotel bar, the party started
Lots of laughing, lots of flirting
Happy faces, total strangers
Looking for love in all the wrong places
I can't imagine
Waking up with anybody else but you
I can't imagine
Waking up with anybody else but you
Lovers come and lovers go
Some you remember, some you don't
Living up to the expectation
Sometimes out of desperation
For me, no solace could be found
Heavy lies the head that wears the crown
All these memories [?]

Waking up with anybody else but you
I can't imagine
Waking up with anybody else but you
I've sang my songs all over the world
And I have met some pretty girls
Someday though, this will end
I might say farewell to all my friends
'Cause after all is said and done
My youthful day for now are gone
There's only one place, one place where I belong

Waking up with anybody else but you
I can't imagine
Waking up with anybody else but you
And when I've been down and out
Only you, baby, only you

And the local time was 11:11
The pilot had his eyes closed
Through that opalescent open road
And then time spread and expanded
The lines fanned out across the land
And I let it
Land me down and tether me ’till I get it
Can I leave the canopy forever
And land me down eternally

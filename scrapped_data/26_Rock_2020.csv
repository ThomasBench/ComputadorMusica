Hey, yeah, oh
When I think of you
It's always on my mind
Is that story true?
No one saves the day (Hey, yeah, oh)
Don't you want the truth?
Ignore reality
See, I love that feeling too
Nobody's gonna stop right now (Hey, yeah, oh)
   Summer is coming, won't go away
   Summer is coming, it's here to stay (Hey, yeah, oh)
  I can't believe it
This is the eleventh hour
Life is such a funny journey
Hercules, your silence is no longer needed
  They got the remedy
But they won't let it happen
Yeah, they got the remedy
But they won't let it happen (Hey, yeah, oh)
Now that you heard the truth
All I need a  friendly face
I hate that feeling too
But no one's unafraid (Hey, yeah, oh)
Don't expect the truth
This is a  fantasy
I fight that feeling too
But nobody's gonna stop us now (Hey, yeah, oh)
   Summer is coming, won't go away
   Summer is coming, it's here to stay (Hey, yeah, oh)
   Lo and behold the salt of the city
    Pillars like time are fading away
   Symphony building up to a future
    Mystery to solve for somebody else (Hey, yeah, oh)
   I can't believe it
   Psychedelic
   Hercules, your silence is no longer needed
   It's just like make-believe
  They got the remedy
But they won't let it happen
Yeah, they got the remedy
But they won't let it happen
   Everybody's on the take
   Tell me, are you on the take too?
   Everybody's on the take
   Tell me, are you on the take too?
          (Hey, yeah, oh)
          (Hey, yeah, oh)
          (Hey, yeah, oh)

Vždyť největší tma je vždycky před svítáním

A když vyletíš nad naší planetu
Tak uvidíš, že se nepletu
Že bydlí tam Bůh a že nás ochrání
Pojď zpívat, tančit, do rytmu hrát
Ať nám to štěstí neodkvete
Pojď zpívat, tančit, nahlas se smát
Pojď zářit celým světem, být jasným světlometem

Teď hned
Teď hned
Hned teď
Tak otevři oči a klidně se rozhlédni
Po každé noci se vždycky rozední
A namísto smutku a funusu
Bouchneme láhev šampusu
Na to že tenhle den není poslední
Pojď zpívat, tančit, do rytmu hrát
Ať nám to štěstí neodkvete

Another hour or two
Bringing me back to you
Another short night
And our summer is through
To usher you through the gloom
When I see your face after the flight home
I know I-I-I-I-I'm not alone
When you call my name through the modern snow
I know I-I-I-I-I'm not alone
I ditched the rental
Grabbed the receipts off the dash
Threw out the baggie
Of coffee grounds and ash
I'll let you go now

Sorry I didn't get
Better at being short
When I see your face after the flight home

Because I don't want to feel alone
Because I don't want to feel alone
No, I don't want to feel alone
Because I don't want to feel alone
Prepare for the landing and
Prepare to be vaguely accused
By the sad and underslept in their royal
blues
Dead in the window, 'cause I wanna know what
it'd feel like
If I got to go outside
And at the bag claim with eyes peeled for
tatters of tags
Flying half-mast like the flag
We wade in a quest for a cab
Nobody wishes for the things
That they already have
We relive every misstep that we've made in our lives
And hoard our scary secrets 'til they wake us at night
And we think we can't escape from it
But maybe we might
If we try to just acknowledge we can do
anything right
You know you're the only person that I
wanted to like me

Now I'm caught in something
My eternal suffering
Looking for the meaning of it all

Don't know where I go when I die
Must be better than this
And I'm here
Just waiting for you to come home

With the revolver and a note
Will you please pick up the phone?
And I'm waiting for you to come home
And I'm screaming all on my own
With the revolver and a note
Will you please come back home?
Ain't it sad when you got nowhere to go?
Got no place to call your home
Burden to everyone you know
And I try
Just not to think about my life
So I do another line
It keeps me numb just for the night
It keeps me numb just for the night

Won't follow my dreams 'cause they all got me waking up screaming

I want you to look to your left, look to your right, your 12 o'clock, three o'clock,
six o'clock, nine o'clock, rock around the clock tonight
And I want you to find those points of no return, those singularities, those burning
rings of fire in the beautiful pupils and the beautiful eyes of the beautiful boy, girl, neither, both,
or in-between that you brought with you tonight, and I want you to tell 'em how you really feel
I want you to love the way they so seamlessly, like a dream for me, so beautifully, oh-so-dutifully jam
that square peg in the round hole in their hearts
I want you to tell 'em that you love the way that they don't stick out like sore middle fingers
That they crawl their way up the side of the bell curve,
stick their flag in the peak, and slide their way back down
I want you to tell them that you love the way that they're not maladaptive, not malcontent,
not malignant or maleficent, but rather that you love them exactly the way that everybody else is
I was nothing before, so I couldn’t have asked to be born
I'll be nothing again, so what am I between now and then?
Is there nothing to fear? Cause shit's getting weird
So to God who made this man, you better have one hell of a plan

If you were thinkin' 'bout stayin' this time

And I got nothin', nothin' but time
It may be half-baked
But I've got lots, lots of ideas
Hey darlin', here's one
Won't you come and lend me your ear?
Like Mona Lisa gave old Da Vinci that half smile
I'll paint a picture that will half convince you I'm fine
It's only midnight
And I've got nothin', nothin' but time
I got half a mind to tell you 'bout it, brother
It's always six of one, and half a dozen of the other
This or that, tit for tat
My baby's on the line
I'm always only half the way to makin' her all mine
I'm only half drunk
If you'll be buyin' one more round
I've been half crazy
Tryin' to simmer, simmer on down
You see half the people, but only half of half of the time
Tell me, how can a nickel stand right up to a dime?
I'm only half drunk
This night is half gone
And I'll be long gone before too long
It's only midnight

Strange as dreams have ever been

A decade ago I was writing this same shit down
I got a lot on my mind, need to get it sorted out
Like a riddle or a puzzle with the pieces scattered ‘bout
What’s the picture of? What route?
Can't think about the doubts
Gotta get up if you get knocked out
You’ve got 2 ways
You’ve got today
You’ve got to do what the fuck you say
You’ve had your woes
You’ve had your your lows
You’ve got to pull yourself out the holes
Everybody gets stalled, blackballed, mind your head
That’s what the sign above me read
Everybody “Mind Your Head”
It was the sign I needed
“Mind Your Head”
“Mind Your Head”
I got a grocery list of things that I’d erase
7 deadly sins, each of them at some point got a taste
I was on a good path, watched it all explode
Lost everything I knew, oh me oh my, reload!
Been on a hell of a road, still on it today
I have walked through many lives
Took a piece of each with me
Life’s a journey till the end
Taking chapters as they come
Keep your head above the water
Eyes sheltered from the sun
You’ve got 2 ways
You’ve got today
You’ve got to do what the fuck you say
You’ve had your woes
You’ve had your your lows
You’ve got to pull yourself out the holes

It was the sign I needed
“Mind Your Head”
“Mind Your Head”
“Mind your head”
“Mind Your Head”
I don’t know what's happening
Im trappin’ in my head again
I’m stressing’ for the medicine
The hocus pocus focus
Thought-forms, a swarm of locusts
But the crack brains not on coke
Just in a race to go broke
The grind its hard to cope
So you charter up a rope
Who wants to die an ordinary bloke?
Ordinary Mary marries ordinary Joe
Ordinary’s scary, ordinary blows
You’ve got 2 ways
You’ve got today
You’ve got to do what the fuck you say
You’ve had your woes
You’ve had your your lows
You’ve got to pull yourself out the holes

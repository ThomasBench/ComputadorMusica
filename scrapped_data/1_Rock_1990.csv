You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry

I wish I was special, you're so fucking special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts, I wanna have control
I want a perfect body, I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice when I'm not around
You're so fucking special, I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here

and I take a deep breath and I get real high and

So take the photographs and still frames in your mind
Hang it on a shelf, in good health and good time
Tattoos of memories and dead skin on trial
For what it's worth it was worth all the while

Losing my religion.

I thought that I heard you sing.

I'm choosing my confessions,
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool, fool

Consider this, consider this,
The hint of a century,
Consider this: the slip
That brought me to my knees failed.
What if all these fantasies
Come    flailing around?
Now I've said too much.

I thought that I heard you sing.

And all of western civilization
The sun may rise in the East
At least it settled in a fine location
It's understood that Hollywood
sells Californication

To break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin, is this your chin?
Or is that war you're waging?

Be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside
Getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard

Space may be the final frontier
But it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain can you hear the spheres
Singing songs off station to station?
And Alderaan's not far away
It's Californication

Control of population

And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar

And tidal waves couldn't save the world

Mr. Jones strikes up a conversation with this black-haired flamenco dancer
You know she dances while his father plays guitar.  She's suddenly beautiful
We all want something beautiful,  man, I wish I was beautiful
So come dance this silence down through the morning
Sha la la la la la la la la yeah       uh huh  yeah
 Cut up, Maria!  Show me some of them Spanish dances
And pass me a bottle, Mr. Jones
  Believe in me.  Help me believe in anything
'Cause I want to be someone who believes, yeah
 Mr. Jones and me, tell each other fairy tales
and we stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you.  Ah, no, no, she's looking at me.""
Smiling in the bright lights, coming through in stereo
When everybody loves you, you can never be lonely
Well, I will paint my picture.  Paint myself in blue and red and black and gray
 All of the beautiful colors are very, very meaningful (yeah, well you know)
Gray is my favorite color  I-I felt so symbolic yesterday
 If I knew Picasso I would buy myself a gray guitar and play
 Mr. Jones and me, look into the future
yeah we stare at the beautiful women
""She's looking at you.  Uh, I don't think so.  She's looking at me.""
Standing in the spotlight, I bought myself a gray guitar
When everybody lo-ves me,  I will never be lo-one-ly
I will never be lonely
I'm never gonna be looone-ly
I want to be a lion.  Everybody wants to pass as cats
We all want to be big, big stars, yeah but we got different reasons for that.
 Believe in me because I don't believe in anything
And I want to be someone to believe, to believe, to believe.
 Mr. Jones and me, stumbling through the barrio
Yeah we stare at the beautiful women
""She's perfect for you, man, there's got to be somebody for me.""
I want to be Bob Dylan
Mr. Jones wishes he was someone just a little more funky
When everybody loves you, ah son, that's just about as funky as you can be.
 Mr. Jones and me, staring at the video
When I look at the television, I want to see me staring right back at me.
We all want to be big stars, but we don't know why, and we don't know how.
But when everybody loves me, I'm going to be just about as happy as I can be.
Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars.....

And all that glitters is gold 
Only shooting stars break the mold 
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder 
You're bundled up now but wait 'til you get older 
But the meteor men beg to differ 
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture 
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin 
The waters getting warm so you might as well swim 
My world's on fire how about yours 
That's the way I like it and I never get bored 
Hey now you're an All Star get your game on, go play

Let us lay in the sun
and count every beautiful thing we can see

in the arms of all I'm keepin' here with me

There is music that sounds from the street
There are lights in the clouds

Hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me
soft and sweet
How the notes all bend and reach above the trees
     Now how I remember you
How I would push my fingers through
your mouth to make those muscles move
that made your voice so smooth and sweet
But now we keep where we don't know
All secrets sleep in winter clothes
with the one you loved so long ago
Now he don't even know his name
What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
that is circling all 'round the sun

I'll be laughing with everyone I see

We've been through this such a long, long time
Just tryin' to kill the pain, oh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head
Just knowin' that you were mine, all mine
So if you want to love me
Then darlin' don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain
Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time all alone?
Everybody needs some time on their own
Don't you know you need some time all alone
I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you
Sometimes I need some time on my own
Sometimes I need some time all alone
Everybody needs some time on their own
Don't you know you need some time all alone
And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, oh yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame
So never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain

  Don't you think that you need someone
   Everybody needs somebody. You're not the only one.  You're not the only one.

And my youth I pray to keep.

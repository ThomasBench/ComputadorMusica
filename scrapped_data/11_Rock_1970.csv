0,Dont Fear The Reaper,Blue Ã–yster Cult,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/408757,"All our times have come
Here but now they're gone
Seasons don't fear the reaper
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain (we can be like they are)
Come on baby (don't fear the reaper)
Baby take my hand (don't fear the reaper)
We'll be able to fly (don't fear the reaper)
Baby I'm your man
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
Valentine is done
Here but now they're gone
Romeo and Juliet
 (that's the F in the next line...)
(see above)
40,000 men and women every day (redefine happiness)
Another 40,000 coming every day (we can be like they are)
Come on baby (don't fear the reaper)
Baby take my hand (don't fear the reaper)
We'll be able to fly (don't fear the reaper)
Baby I'm your man
La-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la
Love of two is one
Here but now they're gone
Came the last night of sadness
And it was clear that she couldn't go on
Then the door was open and the wind appeared
The candles blew out and disappeared
The curtains flew and then he appeared (saying don't be afraid)
Come on baby (and she had no fear)
  And she ran to him (then they started to fly)
They looked backwards and said goodbye (she had become like they are)
She had taken his hand (she had become like they are)
Come on baby (don't fear the reaper)

Shaved her legs and then he was a she
Hey babe, take a walk on the wild side
Said hey honey, take a walk on the wild side

In the backroom she was everybody's darling
But she never lost her head
Even when she was giving head

Looking for soul food and a place to eat

2,Goodbye Stranger,Supertramp,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/supertramp/goodbye-stranger-chords-604261,"  It was an early morning yesterday.
  I was up before the dawn.
  And I really have     enjoyed my stay.
 But I must be moving on.
Like a king without a castle.
Like a queen without a throne.
I'm an early morning lover.
And I  must be moving on.
(EP + Light Drums)
  Now I believe in       what you say,
  Is the undisputed truth.
But I have to have things my own way,
  To keep me in my youth.
Like a ship without an anchor.
Like a slave without a chain.
Just the thought of those sweet ladies,
Sends a shiver through my veins.
   And I will go on shining.
       Shining like brand new.
  I'll never look behind me.
    My troubles will be few.
  Goodbye stranger      it's been nice.
  Hope you find your    paradise.
  Tried to see your     point of view.
  Hope your dreams will all come true.
  Goodbye Mary,         goodbye Jane.
  Will we ever          meet again?
  Feel no sorrow,       feel no shame.
  Come tomorrow,        feel no pain.
 Now sweet devotion   is not for me.
Just give me motion    to set me free.
In the land and the ocean           far away,
 It's the life I've chosen,        every day.
 So, goodbye Mary,       goodbye Jane.
     Will we ever          meet again?
(EP + Light Drums +E Guitar)
  Now some they do and    some they don't,
  And some you just can't tell.
  And some they will and  some they won't.
  For some it's just as   well.
You can laugh at my behaviour.
That'll never bother me.
Say the Devil is my saviour.
    But I don't pay no heed.
   And I will go on shining.
       Shining like brand new.
  I'll never look behind me.
    My troubles will be few.
  Goodbye stranger      it's been nice.
  Hope you find your    paradise.
  Tried to see your     point of view.

  Come tomorrow,        feel no pain.
 Now sweet devotion   is not for me.
Just give me motion    to set me free.
In the land and the ocean           far away,
 It's the life I've chosen,        every day.
 So, now I'm leavin',     got to go.
     Hit the road,          I'll say it once again.
Oh, yes, I'm leaving, I've got to go.
      Got to go,              I'm sorry I have to tell you.
 So, goodbye Mary,       goodbye Jane.
     Will we ever          meet again?

And daddy doesn't understand it,

And it types to a waiting world,
And Mother feels so shocked
Father's world is rocked,
And their thoughts turn to
Their own little girl.

She wants to play with her toys a while,
And school's out early and soon we'll be learning
And the lesson today is how to die.
And then the bullhorn crackles,
And the captain tackles,
With the problems and the hows and whys
And he can see no reasons

Of childhood and stardom,
Blown on the steel breeze.
Come on you target for faraway laughter,
Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!
You reached for the secret too soon,
You cried for the moon.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Threatened by shadows at night,
And exposed in the light.
Shine on you crazy diamond.

With random precission,
Rode on the steel breeze.

Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner and shine!

You're gonna fly high, you're never gonna die,
You're gonna make it if you try, they're gonna love you.

The band is just fantastic that is really what I think,
Oh by the way, which one's Pink?
And did we tell you the name of the game, boy,
We call it ""Riding the gravy train"".
We're just knocked out, we heard about the sell out,
You've gotta get an album out, you owe it to the people,
We're so happy we can hardly count.
Everybody else is just green, have you seen the chart?
It's a helluva start, it could be made into a monster,
If we all pull together as a team.
And did we tell you the name of the game, boy,
We call it ""Riding the gravy train"".
So, so you think you can tell,
Heaven from Hell, blue skys from pain.
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail, a smile from a veil,
Do you think you can tell?
And did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts,
Hot ashes for trees, hot air for a cool breeze, cold comfort for change,
And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?
How I wish, how I wish you were here.
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
Running over the same old ground. What have we found?
The same old fears. Wish you were here!
Nobody knows where you are,
How near or how far.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Pile on many more layers,
And I'll be joining you there.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph,
Sail on the steel breeze.
Come on you boy child, you winner and loser,
Come on you miner for truth and delusion and shine!

Well, I can run and jump and fish, but I won't fight

See your face dancing in the flame, feel your mouth kissing me again

Once I rose above the noise and confusion
Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion
I was soaring ever higher
But I flew too high
Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man
I hear the voices when I'm dreaming
I can hear them say
Carry on my wayward son,  There'll be peace when you are done
Lay your weary head to rest,   don't you cry no more
Masquerading as a man with a reason
My charade is the event of the season
And if I claim to be a wise man
It surely means that I don't know
On a stormy sea of moving emotion
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean
I set a course for winds of fortune
But I hear the voices say
Carry on my wayward son,  There'll be peace when you are done
Carry on 1  2 & 3 & 4 &
You will always remember
Carry on 1  2   & 3 & 4 &
Nothing  equals the splendor
Now your life's no longer empty
Surely Heaven waits for you
Carry on my wayward son,  There'll be peace when you are done

Parking by the lake, and there was not another car in sight
And I never had a girl, looking any better than you did
And all the kids at school, they were wishing they were me that night
And now our bodies are oh so close and tight
It never felt so good, it never felt so right
And we're glowing like the metal on the edge of a knife

C'mon! Hold on tight!

And when the feeling came upon me, like a tidal wave
I started swearing to my God and on my mother's grave,
That I would love you to the end of time
I swore I would love you to the end of time!
So now I'm praying for the end of time,
To hurry up and arrive
Cause if I gotta spend another minute with you,
I don't think that I can really survive
I'll never break my promise or forget my vow,
But God only knows what I can do right now
Praying for the end of time, it's all that I can do, ooh, ooh
Praying for the end of time, so I can end my time with you!!!

Wild man's world is crying in pain
What you gonna do when everybody's insane
So afraid of one who's so afraid of you
What you gonna do-o?
                  Ooooh
Crazy on you
Cra-azy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you - ooh
I was a willow last night in a dream
I bent down over a clear running stream
I sang you the song that I heard up above
And you kept me alive with your sweet flowing love
Cra - zy, yeah
Cra-azy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you - ohh
Cra-azy on you
Cra-azy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you - yeah
Crazy on you
Cra-azy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you - ohhh-ohhhhh

As long as I can have you here with me,
I'd much rather be, forever in blue jeans
Honey's sweet, but it ain't nothin' next to baby's treat,
If you pardon me, I'd like to say,
We'll do   okay, forever in blue jeans
Maybe tonight,maybe tonight by the fire all alone you and I, 
Nothing around but the sound of my heart and your sighs
Money talks, but it can't sing and dance, and it can't walk
As long as I can have you here with me,
I'd much rather be, forever in blue jeans, babe

47,Rocket Man (verÂ 3),Elton John,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/elton-john/rocket-man-chords-114031,"She packed my bags last night pre-flight
Zero hour, nine a.m.
And I'm gonna be high           as a kite by then
I miss the earth so much, I miss my wife
It's so lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them,       if you did
And all this science I don't understand
It's just my job, five days a week
A rocket man,                a rocket man
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Till touch down brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no, I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time

48,Your Song (verÂ 4),Elton John,https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/elton-john/your-song-chords-1089356,"It's a little bit funny this feeling inside 
I'm not one of those who can easily hide 
I don't have much money but, boy if I did 
I'd buy a big house where, we both could live 
If I was a sculptor, but then again, no 
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show 
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do 
My gift is my song and, this one's for you 
And you can tell everybody, this is your song 
It may be quite simple but, now that it's done 
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind,
that I put down in words 
How wonderful life is, while you're in the world 
I sat on the roof and, kicked off the moss 
Well a few of the verses well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind, while I wrote this song 
It's for people like you, that keep it turned on 
So excuse me forgetting but, these things I do 
You see I've forgotten if they're, green or they're blue 
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean 
Yours are the sweetest eyes, I've ever seen
And you can tell everybody, this is your song 
It may be quite simple but, now that it's done 
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind,
that I put down in words 
How wonderful life is, while you're in the world 
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind,
that I put down in words 
How wonderful life is, while you're in the world
